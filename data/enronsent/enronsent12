The End Date on the following Park & Loan contracts has been extended from 9/30/01 to 10/31/01.

I had to create new sitara numbers because the old deal numbers were "Baseload" instead of "Term".

Robert, Rhonda may be adjusting the Leach volume (14,288) up or down a few dth's to balance every day.  That's ok.  Somebody tell Barker what a nice guy I am.

I did a buy/sale with EES where EES will give me TCO pool gas and I will give EES TCO pool or CGLF Leach gas.  The volume is 14,288 per day.

The purchase deal is 1068442, at CGAS IF.  This deal will not change.

The sale deal is #1068455, at CGAS IF - .05.  I have 2 meters on this deal, Kimat, let me know if that will be a problem booking the deal in tagg.

Robert, please chat with Rhonda on which contract to use.  We need to use the same Gulf contract all month long.  It would probably be easier for Rhonda if we use the same contract we used this month.

When I look up this contract in Passkey, I show an MDQ of 16,373.

We think it should be 4723 with the following primary receipt points.
Leg	MDQ
800   	1228
500	897
Z0	2598

I might be looking in the wrong screen.  I am going under contracts/contract maintenance/review

Got my ID and password fixed.  Thanks.

Has Corey said anything to you about my park and loan contract?  I just tried to call him but there was no anwser.

TP1 sold 323 day at CGLF IF + .0175 for Oct, deal 1064505, to EES.

Thanks.

Chris --  As we discussed,   I have changed the transport usage tickets for all the  FT  and  IT  contracts  to now have  TP1  as the primary desk effective  October 1st.

Jeanne Wukasch
ext.  58495

I moved the sale to NYPA at Mamou from TP3 to TP1 effective 10/1/2001.  The old deal number is 815952.  The new deal number is 1063956.

Kimat, I just took the volumes to 0 effective 10/1/2001 on deal 815952.  Should we just delete the lines on the deal ticket for dates after 10/1/2001?

Effective 10/1/2001, the primary desk for transport on TGT will be TP1.

When I look at my position manager for TP3 on 1st-4th, its short by 9189.  TCO is long by 9189 for the same time frame.

Part of the problem is deal 1016655.  I can see that the volumes on the deal for the 1st thru the 4th, but they don't show up in Unify.  These volumes also do not show up on my P&L.  My unaccounted volume on TP3 for September is (36,846  roughly 9189 x 4 days).

TRCO Team,  would you changed the pathed volume in Unify on this deal for the 1st thru the 4th by 1dt please?  I would like to see if that has an impact.

I sold 4,035 dt to the Ontario Desk on NFUL for Sep at +.12 (deal 1016673).

The following deals should be transferred from Brads book to the CNG and East TP3 books at a mid value of NX1 + .1675 for Sep.

The Boston Differential for August 2001 is ($.1166).  I want to understand the contract better before I give you the Sep price.

Ruth, you and I are chatting about this today I hope.

Kam, I'm guessing this becomes an O&A issue each month.  I don't know if you need to be involved or not.

Hi Chris,

I realize that you are getting bugged from a few of us in Canada for the Boston Differential numbers.  I am in Accounting and I am in desperate need of the Boston Differential for August and September so that I can finish my invoicing for the month.  I really have to have these numbers by the end of the day today (latest).  Sorry for being a pest, but I am starting to panic!  Please send these numbers to me or Nicole Laporte, as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Kelly

Chris,
We just require August and September, we already have July.
Would it possible to get the differential number before Wednesday? Our Accounting group requires this number for invoicing and they are a few weeks late with their August invoice and require the differential immediately.
Please let me know,
Thanks,
Nicole

Sorry about the delay.  I'm starting to look at this again.  I know you need August and September.  Did you say you also need July?  

I don't know if Canada makes any money off this deal but my book is taking a beating.  Ruth Concannon and I are meeting Wednesday to discuss this deal.  There are some other things going on with this deal that she is aware of.  I should have your prices by them.

Thanks

Chris,
Attached is a spreadsheet listing the differential since January 1998.
Please let me know as soon as you know something!
Thanks!
Nicole
 << File: BostonGasDifferential.xls >> 

Nicole, would you send us the last price you were given please?

Thanks

Chris, I remember there used to be one excel spreadsheet on Boston. But I can't find any on my CPU, perhaps it got lost when they upgraded my CPU. Do you have it? Let me know what we need to do. Thanks.

Kimat

Nicole, I have the Boston Gas confirmation letter.  Thanks.

Kimat, are you familiar with the Boston Gas worksheet Dick Jenkins would update to calculate the Tenn Z6 city gate price?  It wasn't very big, and Dick would have me verify the Iroquois and Tenn transport variable cost.

Gentlemen,

	It is my understanding that Enron Representative Chris German
informed Tallahassee Representative Pam McCullers, earlier this morning that
Enron would not be scheduling gas to Tallahassee pursuant to subject
agreement for the month of June.  If this is indeed the case and Enron does
not schedule gas with Tallahassee by 9:00 a.m. Eastern Prevailing Time
tomorrow, May 31, 2002, Tallahassee will seek replacement supplies from
alternative sources.

	Should you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to
contact me or Pete Koikos, Director of Energy Services.
Sincerely,

Roger McDonald

FYI, Ed and Don will decide tomorrow if we are going to serve the City Of Tallahassee deal on Florida for June.  I'll keep you posted.

Drew,
We MAY need to make a payment for June gas of appx. $1.3MM for City of Tallahassee, which is on the gas cash forecast.  However, I am not certain that we will be buying the gas.  That decision will be made tomorrow, so please stay ready and we will inform you once we decide.  If you have any questions, please ask.
Ed

Ed,

Should I be expecting/receiving a request to prepay June gas?  My records show that our last prepay for gas occurred on April 29th.  Do you have any feel for how much/when we plan to pay?

Thanks,

Drew Kanellopoulos

Is this a TPI or TP2 deal?

Hey team.  I think I have everyone but feel free to forward this message on to others that may need it.  Brenda Fletcher was asking me 

Enron has the following deals with AEC at Niagara and Leidy.

Deal #		Vol	Buy/Sale	Location	End Term	Book
592845		9189	Buy		Tenn Niagara	10/31/2008	New England
223854		9189	Sale		Tenn Niagara	10/31/2008	New England

415547		9000	Buy		Nful Niagara	10/31/2002	East TP1
415547		6000	Buy		Nful Leidy	10/31/2002	East TP1
1131708	6000	Sale		Nful Leidy	10/31/2008	East TP1

When this deal was done 2 years ago, AEC agreed to give Enron the NFUL transport (I don't know who at Enron agreed to this).  Enron pays NFUL max demand for the space.  I believe the contract price on deal 415547 is a NFUL Leidy price, and part of it should be adjusted for demand, commodity, and fuel.  Also the net delivered volume at Leidy is 9005 dth ( = 9189 at Niagara).

Kam, I'm not sure which firm book this is in.  Over the last few months, I would calculate the transfer price from the firm book to TP1 (or TP3).  As TP1, I take any NFUL length at a CNG equivalent price.  I also created deal 1147662 at 0 price to balance out Niagara.

Also, I believe we need to bill AEC for the demand charges for the last 2 years of this deal.  That's around $1,340,000.  I'm sure AEC is not expecting that.  Does anyone here talk to AEC?

Chris, the contract is the same one I sent you last month.  I have included the confirm for deal 415547.  Please let me know if you need anything else.

 

Thanks,
SBR x30569

Could you send me the confirm for deal 415547, also contract no. 96017703.  This deal is effective 11/1/2001 - 10/31/2002?

Thanks

Chris, attached please find a copy of our contract 96017703 with AEC Marketing (USA), Inc.  and also the confirm for deal 241639 (NE6231).

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Stacey,

I am forwarding this to you from Chris Germany to handle. I checked the deal in Sitara and the contract that is attached is contract no. 96017703. It looks like there is paper however I am having problems with Live Link. You might need to check with Ellen for the confirmation.

Chris has asked a copy of the contract or confirmation on this deal. If we have both I would probably furnish him with both.

Thanks,

Elizabeth is out of the office for a while.  Who could get me a copy of the contract/confirm for deal 241639?

thanks

What's the status on this?
Brenda, I am going to put the National Fuel demand charge on deal 241639.  I will enter it as a negative demand charge.

Elizabeth, would you get me a copy of the contract or confirm for deal 241639 please?

These two new offered service have been setup for Egan Hub.

The end date on #21 (contract # 58654) is 4/30/2005.  The demand charge on #21 and #17 is $3.145 per month.  Also, ACA changed from $.0022 to $.0021 on ALL the CGLF transport.

Chris,

For path #17 and #21, could you tell me what the demand charges should be?  The two are different but are the same locations.  Also, we have #21 through mar-2005, structuring thinks it should be through Apr-2005.

Thanks

Kam

I borrowed 19903 from Egan for today's gas day and I need to pay it back by Friday.  For tomorrow, I am going to over nominate Leach.  After the cuts, if any, I want to back off of Leach and take the gas to Egan to payback back part of my balance.

Here are the deal numbers and volumes.

Deal		Current Vol	After Cuts	Comment
1149149	21,000		10,000		Moves gas from CGLF Leach to TCO Leach.
1143923	31,000		20,000		Mainline to Leach Transport
1143924	49,798		38,469		Onshore to Mainline - volume may be off a little, just need to balance mainline
1161116	7,707		????		Onshore to Egan Hub transport and desk to desk.  Move the onshore balance to Egan Hub.

I may be out this afternoon.  I think we should wait until tomorrow morning to adjust these tickets, UNLESS KELLY, you feel comfortable about CGAS not allocating Leach.  

Thanks for your support.

I told Judy she was going.  

Chris, 
No one from Enron has told us they'd be attending the Houston Ops mtg.  Is no one coming??

Hey girl.  Who are you working for?  You know all my favorite women (except for Judy) work for EnronOnline.

Hi All-

Just thought I'd let you know that I've accepted a new position within EnronOnline and I'll be moving back to Houston in early December.  Should be fun!  I'm looking forward to seeing you all soon and getting back into the swing of things.  

Hope all is well-
Angie

If we are still here that is.  ENE is at $7.36 - mood isn't so good.

Hey- I'll be working directly for Savita Puthigai.  :)  Should be good and I can't wait to be back home!  (Then we'll go for Chick-fil-a and catch up.)

You got that right!!!

Even if we get bought out, the trading arm will still be going strong.  Gas and Power are the only things that ever made us money.  And you better still be there if I'm coming all the way back to see you!!

Due to credit concerns, Carol and Bjorn would like to know all counter parties that we are currently buying or selling spot gas with.

Ex:  I've been buying gas from Reliant Energy Services, Inc. each month to serve one of my term markets.  According to Bjorn, the Credit Committee will no longer approve of my prepayments to Reliant for base load supply.

You may or may not want this but if here it is just in case.

Thanks

I chat with him via aol instant messenger.  His id there is djunek13.

He's not in the office today.

your msn doesn't work.

Thanks.  I appreciate that.  It is a bit gloomy and MOODY over here.  I don't think too many people are excited about Dynegy but its better than bankruptcy.

And I do appreciate the job offer, its just hard to do with a family.  But I will chat with my significant other and see what she says.  I've asked her about moving before and I thought she was going to hit me.

Hey Chris,

I hope the madness that's been occurring over there isn't weighing you down
too much.

I just wanted you to know my offer stands if you'd be interested in looking
at moving to LA to manage our T&E.  Our asset base has been growing and we
are looking to expand some more. Your expertise would be tremendous.  Let me
know.

The TCO book is buying 1,000 dth per day from Power Gas Marketing at Trco-Young Women's Creek.  Effective 11/9/01, CNG began restricting receipts from Trco-Leidy.  We are taking 543 dth into CNG, VNG has 543 dth of primary receipts at Leidy on CNG.

STEVIE, till further notice, the VNG book needs to sell the New York Book 453 dth of Trco Non NY, use deal 1165693.
The transport usage ticket is 1165849, and the buy from TCO is deal 1165737.

GOOD LUCK!

Sure.  I'll be there Monday morning.  Ingrid woudl probably like it too.  What would you have me do?  

Mark Gazelli at Cook Inlet told me he had a job for me in LA.  Talk about a change in location.  I thought that was nice of him to offer though.

So what do you think?  Wait and see if there is any severance, maybe a job, or activly look for a new job?

How could she be as big as you??

Do you want a job up here in DC? You could make a ton of money, ingrid could
stay home with the kid... and we could go to TACO Bell for lunch.

I sold my CGLF to Susan today so you dont need to worry about it on Monday.  I'm flat CGLF.

 

And you thought I didn't have anything ready.  I sent this to Paul yesterday, he said "I'll keep it and see were to fit you in, you should have come when I asked you to"

I guess he's unhappy with me.

I like to have all options open. Look for jobs and work on getting something
lined up. If a company really wants you... they will wait for you. Lot's of
times they will pay you the cash that you are waiting for at your current
company... severance/bonus... etc.

We are looking for folks.. you can send me your resume. They need traders,
capacity folks, schedulers, and of course my errand boy too. Finally, we are
starting to expand since bankruptcy is behind us!!!

Sure.  I'll be there Monday morning.  Ingrid woudl probably like it too.

We had a meeting this morning at 7:00 am but we didn't find out anything new.  Right now it sounds like its business as usuall for the next 5-7 months.  I had a jury duty summons this morning.  I didn't get picked and we got out at 1:00 PM.  Sell my truck yet?

Hey Bub,

Did you get a raise going to the new company?

here kitty, kitty , kitty, ....

Oh this is funny.

Hey, I was waiting for you at the shark club and  you never showed up.  I think you stood me up!!!?!?!?!?!?!?   What's the deal?  Is that how you treat a buddy?  I may not show up the next time.

Paul is a pain the butt... I'm sure he is grumpy because someone chewed on
him at work. Paul has been looking for an experienced transport person
forever. I know he really likes Scott (CES boy used to sit next to you)...
maybe paul is working on him. I think he likes steve gillsbie too.

I'll pass this on to the appropriate person!!! Meet me at the shark club in
bethesda tonight for 50 cent corona's tonight!!

How would you like it if someone pulled out your claws?????

You must have gone to the shark club on the other side of town... I was
there...ha..ha.

Gave your resume to Bob Barron, boss over all gas traders. He's been tied up
in meetings all day... haven't touched base with him yet.

Kitties are good... they are going to loose their claws though... tired of
them f'ing up my furniture.

Are they billing us for 530 dth of transport?  If yes, then its the VNG desk.

Deal # 1071305

Can you tell what Sales deal this is going to?

We are being invoiced for IT transportation on KO for Sept. production.  What desk should this be on?

Thanks,

I see that Shemin is out until next week.  Since you are becoming a law guru you might know the answer to this question.  The following document is an order from the court.  Does that mean it has been filed and is in effect now?

 

I gave it back to my assistant and asked her to cancel it.  I have a company cell phone and I don't need a calling card.

thanks

Chris,
I was speaking with Gerry Hrap and he said that they will require the number by tomorrow morning at the latest for negotiations with Calpine (per discussion with yourself, John McKay, and Scott Neil).
Sorry for the rush,

Hey there.

 Got your message.  I'll get you the numbers by tomorrow afternoon, maybe today.

Robin Barbe just gave me a couple of day care's to sign up for.  One of them is St. Luke's at Edloe and Westheimer.  The other one is Becker's at Sunset and Rice.  AND Robin just told me that St Luke's is Methodist, they have an 8:30, 9:45, and later service.

Hey, how does this get me a new job?  Should I study these and know them by heart?

I have some really bad news.  My little girl, when she makes a frown face, she looks just like her Uncle Jerry.  I think that's a very bad sign.

She weighs 7 lbs 4 ozs as of today.

According to my calculations, TP1 demand charges should be $1,115,826 for Nov.  Would you change that for me?

Thanks

You lucky girl.  Let tell me all the interesting stuff that's going on!!!!!!!

I was on loan to EES since mid July.

I don't know how this asset management deal works on demand charges.  Could you give me a demand charge report out of Unify please?

The spreadsheet for Nov. does not have any demand expense listed for Tetco. The Service P/L report shows demand cost on contracts 895829 and 895835, deal numbers 1146868 and 1146936.

Do you need to update spreadsheet?

Thanks,

I WANT TO GO.  Do you want to come by Wednesday evening.  I'm almost positive we are going to leave early (around 2:00 or so probably).  You won't even get a chance to see my messy apartment because I am going to sleep over at Indrid's and kill (bond) with her cat.

I'm going to see Harry Potter this week.  It's two one half hours long.   You
want to go?   Barb does not want to go with me.    I'll come up to Houston to
see it.  Need to pick up a honey cured ham anyway.  If you do not want to go, no
sweat.   I was thinking about going tonight anyway.

Kevin Benjamin's e-mail address is kbenjamin@calpine.com

The deal didn't go thru.  sorry about that.

Is this supposed to be on the IT contract?  I don't see any volumes in Unify on the IT contract.  

We have a discounted rate of $.1028 on IROQ for the 17-19th, flowing gas from Wadd to Wright.

Is there a way I can see the amount of gas on my storage contract on the EBB?  I looked yesterday and I even tried the "help button" but I couldn't find anything.  The contract number is 15692.

Early this afternoon would be fine, say around 1:30 PM.  My new location is 06456.

Thanks

On Nov 13th, I sold 2700 dth to Black Hills in Tenn Z6 for the 13th.  I bought the gas from Hodge on CNG.  I need to know where the gas is if it didn't get delivered to Tenn.  The deal ticket shows that I changed added the deal at 8:50 am.  The volumes must have been in Sitara because Sitara shows Joann changing the volume from 14085 to 11348 on the 14th?  Then it shows me changing the volume back on the 14th.

Lia, would you see if we even nominated the intraday on the 13th to Black Hills?

thanks

This message is being sent on behalf of Robert Jones

Several weeks ago, we told you we believed we had hit our first cash collection milestone, and indeed we have.  Representatives for the unsecured creditors' committee and the ENA examiner are currently validating our cash collections and we expect them to verify the milestone very soon.  The bankruptcy court judge has also signed the official motion related to the retention and LIP plans, so it is final with no additional follow-up with the court required.  Soon, all the pieces will be in place to make our first Liquidation Incentive Pool dispersement.  Because it will be our first dispersement, we are taking the needed time to establish an accurate and equitable process for this and future payouts.  We plan to hold a meeting with all LIP participants in the next week or two to walk through the procedures we've developed and answer any questions.  We'll be in contact with you soon to schedule that meeting.  

Thank you,
Robert Jones

HEY, you didn't copy your brother and I think I may come down Saturday to go fishing.  What do you think about that?

Man those steaks I cooked Saturday were great.   Bought six Rib Eyes, amn
were they good.   I hurt myself.  Barb had to use the big tractor to move
me around.  If I die from plugged arteries it's yall's fault.   Me having
to eat all those steaks alone.

Not really, we did not have steaks, well not till Sunday when Barb and I
went to El Tora.   We are going t BBQ July Fourth if you guys would like to
come.   Chance is coming in from teh Navy so thought we might cook some.
Dennis and Janice are coming down also.   Figure we will have baked beans,
potatoe salad, few deserts.   Maybe even home made Ice Cream.   You guys
are invited.   Should be lots of babies there.  (New Borns).   I have the
jet ski setting by the water on the bank and will drop the poontoonn boat
in this weekend for riding up ad down the Bayou.

See ya,

Oh yeah Chris, when you called last night Barb and I were out riding the
Scooter around.   Just Chilling.  We rode around looking at houses, yards
etc in town for about 1.5 hours.   It was nice.  Life is good.

Don, your Ex came by Friday for some plants.   She seemed to be doing well.
How about you?

Well gotta go,

Bayou Jer

I have some really bad news.  My little girl, when she makes a frown face,
she looks just like her Uncle Jerry.  I think that's a very bad sign.

She weighs 7 lbs 4 ozs as of today.

Here's my letter.
Mr. Cooper,

First, I would like to thank you for all that you have done so far while here at Enron.  Although it has been difficult to continually hear one bad news story after another, it has been refreshing to finally learn the truth and be given the opportunity to make judgments and decisions based upon reality rather than some pipe dream that was being offered.  I truly feel that with your leadership, Enron is heading in the right direction and is slowly making progress in building back credibility.  

Second, as an employee in the LIP pool, I do however, have a couple of questions.  It has now been over three weeks since we received an update from Robert Jones regarding reaching the first $500,000,000 milestone.  In that update it was mentioned that there were some administrative issues that needed to be addressed with regards to the first distribution.  Are we any closer to resolving those issues and do we have an estimated time for that first distribution?  Second, do we have any idea today of how much money has overall been brought in to the estate that is to be used in determining the funding of the LIP pool?

Thank you so much for your time.

Kathy Kelly

P.S. We are greatly appreciative and happy about the reinstatement of the 401K matching.  Thanks again!

very good and tastefull

Hey team!!  I'm back.

And while I was gone it looks like our cash balance with Reliant is $228,419.05, which is due to ENA selling Reliant the gas back on Trunkline from the 14th through the 20th.

Thanks. I will see on Monday how Brazos ran the plant over the weekend and take a course of action from there. At least 10,000 -15,000 to market.

We did not sell any gas for May 8th-10th.

For gas day 5/7/02, Cinergy/Apache moved 10,000 dth from Sid Rich Cayanosa to Oasis Mi Vida.  Oasis Mi Vida is not a Lone Star point but I didn't know it at the time and I sold the gas to TXU at $3.20.  No sales were made for 5/8/02.

Sold TXU 10,000 dth of Cayanosa for 5/1/02 at $3.45.  I actually sold TXU the gas yesterday and I didn't want to change the volumes for the 1st.  Let me know if you want to sell more than 10,000 for the 2nd.

Thanks

Hey thanks.  You are sweet.  Looks like that 5.25 was a great sale too.

Just thinking about you and my enron friends.

I finally sold my enron stock last week for $5.25.

Heads up.  Andy should be putting in a request to increase my volume on k#37877 to 38,500

Midland sent their volume request to Kevin Brady for the month of June 2002.  Should I forward this to Oxy?  Should I tell Midland to contact Oxy in the future?

Audrey is doing great.  Dad is doing good. Mom is fair.  She's still struggleing with the new Mom stuff.  Not quite the picture book story she had hoped for.  Can't just hop up and do what she wants anymore.  She's a big advocate for birth control now!!

Forget about unimportant work stuff...how are Ingrid and Audrey ???
And is Dad treating them well ??

man that's rude

Not to be rude but - what the heck kind of name is Denver Platchy ????

I'm not sure which attorney to send this too but I'm sure this is Enron's CGLF space.

I would prefer that you fix it.  Just come over when you are ready.

thanks

Looks like you are right about CNR Mar-02. You can fix them on the tab labeled CNRVol (or call me and I'll come do it real quick).

Processing charges are billed by CGAS and CNR (and Gatherco too).  They would be processed and paid by Volume Management.  Some of the extra $0.03 charges are billed by Mark West.

I'm working on the volume split files for Dec-01 Dominion. We can match it with the status/effective date file Robin is fixing.

Call you soon.

WRP

Quetion about March 2002, it looks like the volumes used in the Payment file are the gross volumes from the CNR volume file, not the net volumes.  Would you check on that please sir?

Thanks.

i'm working thru my 188 emails, would you see if there are any invoice drafts for april 2002 for midland cogen please

both sitara deals have been changed to a zero volume apr out.

chance

Can you handle this?  I do not have Sitara access.

Thanks,
Greg

We stopped serving Midland Cogen on Sitara deals 340305 and 332163 effective 4/1/2002.  There are trigger prices on both of these deals which automatically generates an invoice whether we physically serve the deal or not (see invoice number 36538SA for April 2002 production).  For April 2002, these deals are generating a credit invoice in the amount of $390,748.50.  I would like to take the trigger volumes to 0 effective 4/1/2002 for the term of the deal to see if this reverses out the credit created in April and keeps us from sending out a credit invoice in the future.

Let me know if this is an issue?  

Thanks.

Thanks. I will see on Monday how Brazos ran the plant over the weekend and take a course of action from there. At least 10,000 -15,000 to market.

We did not sell any gas for May 8th-10th.  

Sold TXU 5,000 dth of Cinergy/Cayanosa for 5/11-13/02 at $3.32.

For gas day 5/7/02, Cinergy/Apache moved 10,000 dth from Sid Rich Cayanosa to Oasis Mi Vida.  Oasis Mi Vida is not a Lone Star point but I didn't know it at the time and I sold the gas to TXU at $3.20.  No sales were made for 5/8/02.

Sold TXU 10,000 dth of Cayanosa for 5/2/02 at $3.51.

Sold TXU 10,000 dth of Cayanosa for 5/3/02 at $3.36.

Sold TXU 10,000 dth of Cayanosa for 5/4-6/02 at $3.18.

Sold TXU 10,000 dth of Cayanosa for 5/1/02 at $3.45.  I actually sold TXU the gas yesterday and I didn't want to change the volumes for the 1st.  Let me know if you want to sell more than 10,000 for the 2nd.

Thanks

Just all outstanding unpaid amounts.  it mite be easier for me to just go through the file and not worry about the copies since we are on the same floor.  I just need you to tell me what is outstandind and what isn't.

Any particular production month(s)/year?

m.m.

I would like to get copies of all the outstanding Dominion invoices please.  I don't need the big producer allocation statements, just the invoices showing all the demand, parking, and variable cost.  If you guys have files where the invoices are, let me know and I'll just go through the files myself and forget the copies.

Dominion sent us a large packet with information about all the contracts and some producer information.  Let me know if you want to see the producer information.

Thanks

I didn't send this yet and I have not spoken with Cinergy either.  Would you call Jackie at Cinergy please.  Also, the scheduling contact at TXU is David Avila, his number is 214-875-9792, his aol id is avila4404.  I gave David the upstream information.  He said that for the weekend the downstream k# is 1901.

i don't have it.  I think Max Doner gets a copy from someone but I'm not sure who.  

Can you tell me how to attain access to this info?

B.

Just checking to see if things are going back to normal for Friday, the 10th.  I would like to start selling our imbalance gas again on Sat if possible.

Thanks. 

this is looking good.

Chris:

The plant used 42,985 MMBtu yesterday, 5/8/02

Actually, I need all of them because I can't tell what these items are for.  I will highlight the items that I think need to go out and put this report on your desk, can't be that many of them.  But I would still need the invoices to see what these items are for.

 which invoices do you want copies of

I have the gas Sales Invoice List Report that you just gave Phil, I think.  Would it be possible to format this with the deal numbers, or give me the invoices so I can see the deal numbers?

Thanks

I'm forcasting $30,000.00 to be paid to Reliant this Friday for the Tallahassee deal.

 

I was just looking at the confirm for April and I believe the pricing doesn't match up.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.

Shelley verified receipt of our $10,000.00 payment o Reliant last Friday.  Thanks Shelley.

Our current cash balance with Reliant is $60,880.00.

 

I see there are some processsing charges for CGAS and CNR.  Who bills us for these charges?  I may need to add another column to my worksheet or at least at the payment amounts to the numbers.

FYI - 
 
At the suggestion of Ed, I went ahead and sent Melissa a cookie bouquet for her whole family to enjoy.  If everyone gave $3.00 that 
would take care of it!  
 
I will be buying a card as well this weekend, we can sign it and send it to her house, to let her know we are thinking of her and wish 
her the best.

One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well. The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally he decided the animal was old and the well needed to be covered up anyway. It just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey.

He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him. They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's amazement, he quieted down. A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well and was astonished at what he saw.

With every shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up.  As the farmer's neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and trotted off!

Now, the Moral of the Story:
Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up.  Each of our troubles is a stepping stone. We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up!

Remember the five simple rules to be happy:
1. Free your heart from hatred.
2. Free your mind from worries.
3. Live simply.
4. Give more.
5. Expect less.

P.S.: The donkey later came back and kicked THE SHIT out of the bastard that tried burying him.

Moral: When you try to cover your ass, it always comes back to get you.

But I'm going to try and keep it down to minimum.

thanks

As I mentioned at the employee meeting in April, this Friday, May 3, we will present to the Creditors' Committee a plan to separate our core energy assets from the estate and the issues surrounding our bankruptcy through a process called a "363 Sale."  These assets are viable businesses that represent Enron's roots.  If we are able to move quickly, we believe this 363 Sale process will allow us to maximize the value of these assets.

We intended to rollout our plan to employees early next week following the presentation to the Creditors' Committee.  However, the Wall Street Journal got a relatively final draft of our plan and were prepared to run a story today.  To ensure accuracy, we decided to work with the Journal on their story and I participated in an interview late yesterday afternoon.

I certainly regret that you have to learn about our plans from the media rather than directly from me or other members of the management team.  Yet until we present to the Creditors' Committee, we are still not at liberty to share the full details of the plan with employees.  We look forward to proceeding with our rollout early next week.  In the meantime, we've attached below the article from the Wall Street Journal.

Enron Plans Return to Its Roots --- Draft Proposal to Creditors Envisions a Smaller Firm Focused on Hard Assets
By Rebecca Smith and Mitchell Pacelle
The Wall Street Journal

	Enron Corp. plans to reorganize as a small company under a new name, according to a draft copy of the firm's plans -- returning to its roots of a decade ago, before the aggressive strategy that led to its spectacular expansion and then collapse. 
	Under plans scheduled to be presented to creditors Friday, Enron would carve out a small integrated energy company with assets of about $10 billion in North and South America. The new entity would likely take a new name in order to escape the taint of Enron's fall and the baggage of numerous investigations into its finances.
	It would then be put on the block in bankruptcy court, quickly giving Enron's creditors the choice to retain a stake in the new company -- or sell it off, whole or in parts, if more attractive bids emerge. 
	Enron lost the confidence of creditors and investors as revelations emerged last fall that the Houston-based company had hid debt and pumped up profit through a series of off-balance-sheet ventures that in some cases enriched a handful of senior executives. After failing to merge with rival Dynegy Corp., the company sought bankruptcy-court protection in December, the largest such filing in U.S. history. 
	The new plan calls for a small operating company -- for now dubbed "OpCO Energy Co." -- to own power plants, electric utilities, natural-gas pipelines and liquefied-natural-gas facilities, but little else. The biggest properties would be the Portland General Electric utility in Oregon; Elektro, a Sao Paulo-based Brazilian utility and about 15,000 miles of pipeline assets on both continents -- less than half the amount of pipes that Enron once possessed. 
	The plan would essentially make the Enron successor little different from other U.S. energy companies that provide electricity and natural gas, giving it few advantages over competitors. It would also make the new company more reliant than ever on volatile South American operations at a time when its U.S. rivals are scaling back their commitments in the region. 
	Nevertheless, Enron's new management team, headed since January by restructuring specialist Stephen Cooper, hopes that the creation of a new company will protect the assets it needs from a long bankruptcy-reorganization process that could hurt their value. Under the company's plan, all of Enron's other assets would be liquidated in that process. The number of employees would drop steeply -- from about 23,000 today (already down from a peak of 31,000 before the bankruptcy) to around 12,000. 
	"In my view, we're going to be in bankruptcy for a number of years, because of the difficulty we're going to have resolving all of the claims," Mr. Cooper said in an interview yesterday afternoon, after Enron's board had met to go over the plan. 
	A spinoff, he said, also could protect the new business from problems stemming from the bankruptcy such as customers wary of entering into new contracts and a welter of litigation and competing claims. Customers who otherwise might shun Enron could embrace the new company, Mr. Cooper predicted: "Once we're out from under, what they will see is a company with great assets and great cash flow that can stand on its own two legs." 
	Enron's creditors wield enormous influence over how the bankruptcy reorganization will unfold. Mr. Cooper and his advisers will have to convince these unsecured creditors -- who have asserted billions of dollars in claims -- that they stand to recover more of their money by turning Enron's core assets into a new company than selling them off in a fire sale. Because Enron now owes a fiduciary obligation to them, these creditors have the power to press the company to alter the plan considerably, or to proceed directly to a liquidation. 
	"The [creditors'] committee has a bunch of bright, reasonable businesspeople on it," said Mr. Cooper. "Their goal, to maximize value, is consistent with ours. I'm confident that we will be able to make a case for value maximization by adopting this approach." 
	Luc Despins, a lawyer for the creditors' committee, said he hadn't yet seen the plan and couldn't comment. 
	Protracted negotiations are likely to follow the Friday meeting. If and when Enron reaches an accord with creditors, Enron will file the plan with the bankruptcy court, which must then approve it. 
	The proposed reorganization would sweep away a decade of rapid growth, returning the company to its size in 1992, when former Chairman Kenneth Lay and then-President Richard Kinder were running the company. Four years later, Mr. Kinder left Enron and was replaced by Jeffrey Skilling, under whose leadership the company began to disparage hard assets and emphasize the energy-trading business that eventually turned Enron into a far larger concern. 
	Whether the new company can escape the taint of Enron is far from certain. "The success of OpCo as a going concern will depend on its ability to separate reputationally from Enron," the draft business plan says. In addition to winning support from creditors, Enron must disentangle itself from many complicated financial arrangements and an existing agreement to sell Portland General Electric to Northwest Natural Gas Co., a deal which hasn't yet closed. 
	In recent months, new managers have devoted considerable energy to trying to understand Enron's complicated financial arrangements. They are also trying to unravel the contents of a plethora of "SPEs" or special-purpose entities. They were created, beginning in the mid-1990s, as a way to pump up profits, hide debt and raise money from outside investors. 
	The draft plan contains a list of assets Enron wishes to retain for the new company, some of which may be entangled in these special-purpose entities. For example, Centragas, a pipeline company in Colombia, is a proposed asset of the new company. But separate, internal spreadsheets reviewed by The Wall Street Journal show that controlling interest of that pipeline already had been pledged to two investment vehicles, Rawhide LP and Whitewing LP. They, in turn, may have passed along interests to other Enron entities, Tombstone Assets LLC and Ponderosa Assets LP. 
	The company said it is trying to "unwind" many of the investment vehicles to gain clear title to the assets for the new company, but it cautioned that "the unwind and resolution of these structures may affect the financial results presented" for the new company. 
	If the new company is created as outlined, its pro forma net income -- based on past performance of the units it hopes to retain -- is projected to be $243 million this year, $352 million next year, $450 million in 2004 and $503 million by 2005. That is based on assets of $10.1 billion currently, rising to $11 billion by 2003. 
	That's a far cry from what Enron claimed at its peak. In 2000, the last year that full financial records were posted by the company, Enron said its net income was $979 million on $100.8 billion in revenue. Those numbers -- as well as financial statements in the previous three years -- were eventually retracted as Enron came under increasing scrutiny from investors and regulators. 
	The plan said the company wants to keep enough assets to form the basis of a new company because the market is "already overloaded with properties for sale" and prices aren't very good. Enron's collapse is partly to blame for that market glut, because credit standards have been tightening, forcing many energy firms to shed assets and pare debt.

You should have the email below in your inbox talking about the producers on CGAS.  Reply to the email below once you find out if you are able to use the producer's gas without maintaining a balance.

Here is a quick update on how the Columbia Gas Transmission,TCO, bankruptcy hearing went last week for the EES issues:

TCO agreed to withdraw the portion of their motion that was associated with EES.  The pipeline admitted that EES has been using their transport contracts and have been paying their bills since the bankruptcy petition date.
The $2.1 million claim that TCO had been including in the Enron "set off amount" (i.e. the remaining demand charges for EES's agreements until the end of the contract terms) was pulled out TCO's Motion.
The minimum OBA/pooling agreement monthly balance should no longer be required by the pipeline (Note:  Originally TCO appeared to be using EES's minimum balance to set off ENA & EES obligations). 

I would recommend that you challenge TCO's operations folks, if they continue to say that EES must be keeping a minimum balance in your OBA.  If you have any problems, please let me know and I will get our outside counsel involved again.

April prices
		Inside Ferc	Per Midland
ANR LA		3.31		3.3125		Looks good
Pepl		3.29		3.3345		appears high by about $.0245 but not way off.
Trk Tx		3.28		3.28		Trunkline should be an average but this is great, our price would have been $3.305

Attached is a spreadsheet containing what MCV is claiming is due to them for non-deliveries for April.  Do you think the replacement price makes sense?

Phil:
Here is a quick spreadsheet showing the detail to the invoice.  Hope this
helps.
Ren?e

Thanks Renee.  Is there anyway you could scan and send me the the invoice
you sent us for $384,975 (your Control Number 103027)?  I have a faxed
copy, but the numbers are difficult to read on it.  Otherwise, maybe you
could just send me a spreadsheet with the numbers on there?

   Phil:

   After quickly looking at invoices since Jan 2000, it appears the
   majority of
   the problems started to occur in early 2001. There are only small
   rounding
   differences occurring in 2000. It also looks like there were several
   months
   where MCV overpaid the Enron invoice to comply with the contract price.

   Let me know if you need further information from me.

I am requesting a prepayment of $10,000.00 to be paid to Reliant for Friday May 3rd.

 

To my knowledge that capacity is still valid.  It's one of Connie Moody's leftover contracts for 117 dth.  

Ruth, I had asked George Linder? at Nat Fule about Nat Fuel taking this capacity back or at least including it in an open season several times.  He never did anything with it.

Chris,

there is also a demand fee of $714.14 that we pay on contract F01978 on National Fuel.  Is that still a valid charge.  The deal number is 1190921.  We are still accruing charges for 2002 on that deal.  Please advise.

Thanks,
Rita

Per John Maybray (716-827-2385) at National Fuel, the following capacity was recalled effective 1/1/02.

Pipe	Contract		MDQ	End Term	Sitara		Comment
NFUL	B00693-038181		9,005	10/31/02	1190912	Recalled effective 1/1/02.  I adjusted the deal in sitara.

Robin confirmed that we did receive the payment from CMS.  This is the amount we invoiced CMS or the Michcon storage gas.

Thanks Robin!

4/30/02  8:25 AM - Janelle said they would send the money today. 

Ed, this is what we discussed.

I just spoke with Janelle Shaunghnessy (517-768-2076) at CMS Marketing regarding our March 2002 production invoice to them.  The invoice is for the 50,000 dth per day of Michcon Storage gas that we were selling CMS.  The total amount is $3,695,975.00.

According to Janelle she has not received the invoice yet so I just faxed it to her at 517-768-2110.  She said that they should be able to make the payment tomorrow.

1:28 PM, I just confirmed that Janelle received the faxed invoice.

From their website

     

Sold TXU 10,000 dth of Cayanosa for 5/1/02 at $3.45.  I actually sold TXU the gas yesterday and I didn't want to change the volumes for the 1st.  Let me know if you want to sell more than 10,000 for the 2nd.

Thanks

I just briefly told Ed what you and I discussed.  He doesn't seem to want any additional info.  I'll keep my notes of our conversation anyway.

Harry, I think we finally have everything done on our side.  Would you give me your phone number and address and we will mail you the GISB.

Thanks

Chris, I need to also send you a copy of our Special Provisions to the GISB,
they are forth coming.

Harry

Got it.

Thanks

Jared Kaiser at UBS said we should speak with Roger McDonald at Tallahassee and that Pam McCullers (my contact) would be able to give us his number.

I just left a voicemail for Pam McCullers  - asking for Roger's phone number and title.

Scroll down and look at the list of names.

Melissa verified receipt of our $45,000.00 wire yesterday.  Thanks Melissa.

You should receive the following wires today.
$683,835.20 for baseload gas on Trunkline (6,800 dth x 31 days x $3.244)
$1,365,767.00 for baseload gas on Florida (13,000 dth x 31 days x $3.389)

Our current swing gas cash balance is $81,700.00 so we may not send another wire until next week.

Also, Robin Barbe will be my backup when I'm out.  Her number is 713-853-7177.

Thanks

 

4/30/02  8:25 AM - Janelle said they would send the money today. 

Ed, this is what we discussed.

I just spoke with Janelle Shaunghnessy (517-768-2076) at CMS Marketing regarding our March 2002 production invoice to them.  The invoice is for the 50,000 dth per day of Michcon Storage gas that we were selling CMS.  The total amount is $3,695,975.00.

According to Janelle she has not received the invoice yet so I just faxed it to her at 517-768-2110.  She said that they should be able to make the payment tomorrow.

1:28 PM, I just confirmed that Janelle received the faxed invoice.

I don't see you on MSN.  My time free's up after 9:00 in the morning.  Tallahassee has to call on the swing gas by then.

Chris,

Do you know anything about these contracts?  To the extent that you can define roughly the shape of this deal, I would appreciate it.

Let's talk about this Tuesday when you free up.

Thanks,
Mike

consider it tossed

Toss it.

that sounds good to me, unless i hear from you in 30 min or so i'll toss what we have from them.

Chris,

The plant was faxing this to Enron for them to determine gas scheduling. Since I have become more involved, I don't think the plant needs to fax this over to you/Justin/Kevin any longer.

If you agree, I will inform the plant.

MM

Vince Hawkes is faxing Justin Fernandez a daily generation and gas plan sheet.  Kevin Brady is in the group that Justin was in before he left and Kevin is delivering this report to me everyday.  Is this something that we should continue to get?

Call me ASAP please.  My number is 713-853-4743

Last week, several Enron employees participated in a roundtable discussion for National Public Radio's Marketplace.  The discussion, which focused on working at Enron today and the company's efforts to reorganize, was positive and upbeat.  In Houston, the segment is scheduled to run tonight, April 29 at 6:30 p.m. CST on KUHF 88.7 FM.  Employees outside of Houston should check their local NPR listing for Marketplace air times.  The segment also will be available later today on NPR's website: www.npr.org.  

Lets see if this works.  My response is down below in blue.

I don't know if you guys can pull up my file from the previous email.  Here it is again just in case.

 

can you also add Karen Herrmann to the distribution?  She handles most of the day-to-day accounting.

thanks!

Opps.  Would help if I included Theresa.

Sold 10,000 dth of Conger gas to TXU for 4/30/02 at $3.24, that wraps up the sales for April 2002.

Theresa, I've attached my worksheet showing how much we sold TXU for April and what price.  The daily volumes are in column M and the daily prices are in column N.  We should bill TXU for 301,000 dth and a dollar amount of $952,055.00.  Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks

We sold 10,000 dth of the Conger gas to TXU for 4/24 at $3.40

OK, Kathy and Troy have pointed out how bad my previous email was.  I'm sure I was thinking about lunch.

Sabra Dinari scheduled the gas on Lone Start.  She quit on Friday.  I will be doing the scheduling until further notice.  Kathy Kelly will be my backup when I'm out.

Sold 10,000 dth of Conger to TXU  for 4/23 at $3.37

FYI

I just checked the Tenn EBB and it does not appear that Boston Gas is releasing the Net 284 space to anyone.  I also just got off the phone with Ivy at Iroquois, she is the capacity release lady.  She said she didn't think that Boston Gas has been using this space at all.

OK, that's it.  NO VACATION FOR YOU!

Boy, I really am looking at this calendar wrong.  I will be out Monday July 15th, through Monday July 29th.  

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Kathy

Sorry, actually, it will be Monday, July 15th. through Monday July 30th.

Kathy

Ed, 

I would like to request vacation time for July 16th  through July 30th.  Chris Germany will be backing me up on the Juniper activity that I recently acquired from Joan Quick.  

Please let me know if you foresee any problems with this time frame.

Thanks,

Kathy

Cute little bugger.  Scott Goodell said forget the Salt Lake City thing.  He said Suzanne is paving the way for him with Michael Cathey.  I don't know him. 

U are here!!!!    LUcky me.

The total amount we invoiced them for is $1,701,160.65.  I have a call into my contact there for information on what they didn't pay.  When I talked with her last week she did not indicate a short payment on the invoiced amount.  I will fax you the invoices.  

Also, I check in Unify this morning and nothing has come across for that 155,000 MMBtus.  So it is still not invoiced.

The $1,272,099 payment received from MCV was a lot less than I thought it would be.  I know that we had not yet invoiced them for 155,000 MMs on Panhandle, but the revenue associated with this was only $381,300.  My estimated total payment was for $2,038,374. 

What did we actually invoice them for in total?  If you could fax me the invoices to 646-3037.

Thanks.

Jackie, just wanted to let you know that there is some work on the pipeline in May.  I'm not sure of the impact just yet but either I or Kathy Kelly will keep you posted.

Thanks.

The nominations are due by April 29th at 2:00 P.M.  Also you need to know
that on May 7th through May 9th, TXU LSP will be replacing a piece of our
Line X Pipeline just to the east of the Ponderosa plant.  This means that
what gas you bring in from West Texas will have to match pretty much what
you burn.  Since this part of the pipeline will be cut off from the rest of
the pipeline there will be no way to handle swings in usage on the pipeline
during this time period.

I you have any questions please give me a call at 214-875-5185.

Chris.Germany@enron.com on 04/24/2002 07:12:19 AM

Hey Jeff, when are noms for the 1st due?

Thanks

yes maam.  GOOD LUCK!!

i have 2 binders on top of a filing cabinet.  not sure if you are interested, but stop by sometime and pick up.

Perfect.  thanks

Here is the e-mail Lisa, u don't need to respond to us, I will respond to all that u and myself had spoken and confirmed the volume??and as a follow up I forwarded this document to you for your record keeping.

For July  2002, Ponderosa Pines is electing to take 20,000 per day.  Please let me know that you received this email.

Thanks

NOW THAT's WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR!!!!

Thanks Drew.

Ok, no more bad talk about Drew for the rest of the week.  Is today Friday?

just kidding

Chris,

If you send me an email this afternoon with the estimated amount (I assume it will be $2.1MM) and the net benefit/(cost) to the estate, I will add the amount to the summary for discussion with the Cash Committee on Monday.  If we get the request signed on Monday we should have no problem sending the wire on Tuesday as long as Larry Cash reserves the cash for Tuesday.

Drew

Drew, 
 
I need to send out a payment of about $2.1 million next Tuesday to Reliant.  The price is based off the NYMEX settle for today which we won't know until after 3:00 PM.  And I prefer to wait until the day after NYMEX settles so I can see the price in a published document like Gas Daily.  This puts us in a bit of a bind.  

What I can do is prepare the cash request form today based off the NYMEX settle, that means you won't get it from me until after 3:30 PM.  Monday morning I will verify the price in print, and get the signed wire request to you before 10:00 AM assuming Margaret, Ed, and Susan are all available to sign it.  Phil already has an estimate for these amounts on the Gas Cash Forcast worksheet.

Let me know if this works for you.  

Chris please send me the wire information for Tuesday as soon as possible.  We are packing up to move today.  Thanks.

Melissa, I requested a prepament of $45,000.00 to be wire on Monday.  On Tuesday you will receive our prepayment for the 2 baseload deals we did for May 2002, about $2.1 million or so, depending on where NX1 settles at today.  

Our current cash balance for the swing gas is about $43,200.00 after making purchases for the weekend.

Thanks

Priscilla won't talk to me but this is what I think she billed Mid American

310,000 dth x $2.47 per dth = $765,700.00

Goods and Services Tax  $765,700.00 x 7% = $53,599.00

Total Bill = $765,700.00 + $53,599.00 = $819,299.00

Priscilla, do we know who at Enron will pay the Goods and Services Tax?

 

We received this yesterday.  Is it the correct amount?

need to contact them within 45 days of birth, qualifies as a life event and its effective the date of birth

my flex dollars received  will increase from $164.29 to $182.67

My current flex dollar expense will go from $103.62 to $165.22 with Immer's kid.

nope, i think it looks real good with burns like that.  but when you see a low day come in we should probably sell a littel more for the next day.

Chris,

The last two days the consumption at the plant has been 42,085 MMBtu and 38,852 MMBtu. These are plant reads based on 7am-7am timeframe. Do we need to sell an additional 5,000 MMBtu in order to pull more off of Lonestar??

Do my prepays to Reliant for gas fall under your exception comment below even though they are not same day payments?
 
I can prepare my weekly cash request for swing gas with 2 days notice. I will just need to maintain a bigger cash balance with Reliant - probably about $20,000 more than what I've been keeping.  Let me know what your preference is.
 
I have 2 important payments (estimate of $2.1 mill) going out next Tuesday that are on Phil's Cash Forecast worksheet but I won't know the price until late Friday afternoon - usually this only happens during bid week and I hope this qualifies as an exception (let me know about this one too).  I actually prefer to see the price in print the day after NYMEX rolls off.   I will also be hounding you several times next Tuesday afternoon just to make sure these payments go out on time.

Folks,
 
Starting Monday, 4/22/02, manual wire requests will have to go through the Cash Management Committee (CMC) the day before payment.  This means that the request forms and accompanying support documentation will have to be signed by the appropriate signatories of the business unit (BU), the BU CAO and the BU Head and delivered to myself (3-6337) at EBN 714a or Drew Kanellopoulos (3-9424) the day before the CMC meeting.  For example, if you need a wire sent on Wednesday, 4/24/02, you would need to deliver the request to us by the end of the day on Monday, 4/22/02 so the request could be reviewed at the 4/23/02 CMC meeting.  Check requests should be delivered three days in advance.
 
The only exceptions to this process will be items such as same day payment for prepay commodities.  
 
We appreciate you helping us relieve the incredible stress on the system to get payments more efficiently and please pass this on to anyone I have missed.
 
Regards,
Doug

Transportation Rates
Any shipper wishing to discuss transportation or storage and the associated rates for such services should contact <../contact.asp> a Transportation Services Manager. 

Shippers may also request rates for transportation using the Transportation Rate Request Form <transrateform.asp> and faxing it to one of the Transportation Services Managers. 

Please contact  <../contact.asp>a Transportation Services Manager if you would like to receive TXU Lone Star Pipeline's Daily Available Capacity notification via e-mail every morning. 

TXU Lone Star Pipeline is a Texas intrastate pipeline that connects to three major Texas market centers at Waha, Carthage, and Katy. TXU Lone Star Pipeline provides producers, end-users, and marketers with a full range of intrastate and Section 311 transportation services, including long- and short-term storage, parking and lending, and end-user pooling. 

TXU Lone Star Pipeline is a division of TXU Gas Company, a subsidiary of TXU. TXU Lone Star Pipeline is the 14th-largest natural gas pipeline in the US, with over 7,746 miles of gathering and transmission lines in its Texas intrastate system.

TXU Lone Star Pipeline's system connects three major market centers -- Waha in West Texas, Carthage in East Texas and Katy, near Houston connects with Texas intrastate pipelines, interstate pipelines and plant outlets at more than 100 points.

TXU Lone Star Pipeline has seven active natural gas storage facilities. These facilities, including two large-capacity underground salt-dome storage caverns, have a total working gas capacity of 44 billion cubic feet.

TXU Lone Star Pipeline transported an estimated 600 Bcf in 1998 for LDC, industrial, electric generation and off-system transportation customers.

Please read the note below from Jeff at Lone Star, it looks like we may need to be particular for May.  Of cause that would involve me knowing a little more about the pipeline.

The nominations are due by April 29th at 2:00 P.M.  Also you need to know
that on May 7th through May 9th, TXU LSP will be replacing a piece of our
Line X Pipeline just to the east of the Ponderosa plant.  This means that
what gas you bring in from West Texas will have to match pretty much what
you burn.  Since this part of the pipeline will be cut off from the rest of
the pipeline there will be no way to handle swings in usage on the pipeline
during this time period.

I you have any questions please give me a call at 214-875-5185.

Hey Jeff, when are noms for the 1st due?

Thanks

Yesterday David Drapper (sits a few rows over from us and works for EES) asked me what the status was with the Dominion producers.  I told him we were still waiting for Dominion to call us back.  He said that Sean Holmes told them to "just pay the producers".  I told David that I wouldn't do anything without knowing what Ruth and legal are doing.

Sounds like a little tendency to "split up".  Just like the old days.

Susan just called me and said she is the CAO for ENA and she should be the one to sign off on the wire requests.  I didn't know.
 

I don;t know.  Maybe she has to sign them too

 

I decided to wait until tomorrow to do the prepay to go out Monday.
 
Margaret, for some reason my cash request form has Susan Helton's name on it and she has to sigh the wire I think.  Why wouldn't that be you instead?
 
 

[Germany, Chris] 
Folks,
 
Starting Monday, 4/22/02, manual wire requests will have to go through the Cash Management Committee (CMC) the day before payment.  This means that the request forms and accompanying support documentation will have to be signed by the appropriate signatories of the business unit (BU), the BU CAO and the BU Head and delivered to myself (3-6337) at EBN 714a or Drew Kanellopoulos (3-9424) the day before the CMC meeting.  For example, if you need a wire sent on Wednesday, 4/24/02, you would need to deliver the request to us by the end of the day on Monday, 4/22/02 so the request could be reviewed at the 4/23/02 CMC meeting.  Check requests should be delivered three days in advance.
 
The only exceptions to this process will be items such as same day payment for prepay commodities.  
 
We appreciate you helping us relieve the incredible stress on the system to get payments more efficiently and please pass this on to anyone I have missed.

Sold 10,.000 dth of Conger gas to TXU for 4/25 at $3.29

We sold 10,000 dth of the Conger gas to TXU for 4/24 at $3.40

OK, Kathy and Troy have pointed out how bad my previous email was.  I'm sure I was thinking about lunch.

Sabra Dinari scheduled the gas on Lone Start.  She quit on Friday.  I will be doing the scheduling until further notice.  Kathy Kelly will be my backup when I'm out.

Sold 10,000 dth of Conger to TXU  for 4/23 at $3.37

Our scheduler, Sabra Dinari, quit on Friday so I will be handling the noms for awhile and Kathy Kelly will.  I think its easier for me to do the noms on this since I'm selling point specific gas and we are not putting this activity in Sitar/Unify.

Theresa, looks like I will be the one addressing the accounting questions.

I've sold TXU 10,000 dth at $3.14 for Sat.4/20 through Mon. 4/22

Sabra, I sold them 10,000 of Conger gas

Sold TXU 15,000 dth at $3.315 for Fri 4/19/02.  

Sabra, I sold them 10,000 of Conger gas and 5,000 of the Sprayberry.  

Sold TXU 10,000 dth at $3.17 for Thur 4/18/02.  I checked on the price with Darren Farmer at AEP and he said that's where Waha was trading so I don't feel like we are being taken advantage of too much.

Sold TXU 10,000 dth at $3.27 for Wednesday 4/17/02.

Kevin is my hero.

	thanks 
	robin

If that is the case then converting 327,081gj's to mm's yields 310,012mm's, so you are probably correct, I can adjust it to reduce down the 12mm's.

I am starting to path it up right now, I have a question regarding the volume. The way I have interpreted these e-mails, we should be withdrawing a total of 310,000 from dawn storage, right now deal1199439 is set up to deliver 327,081. I can adjust the back end days to reduce our deliveries down to 310,000, just want to be sure this is our target #.

this is what I expect to be paid out next Tuesday

I'm buying all the baseload gas from Reliant 

Tallahassee 	10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $3.57 = $1,106,700

MCV		6,800 dth per day x 31 days x $3.57 = $752,556

I will probably pay NX1 + .05 or so for the Tallahassee gas because I'm buying point specific gas and NX1 flat to -.02 for the Trunkline.  I would prefer to be conservative so bump the prices up as you see fit.

Rita FYI - I told Ed that I would go with Bridgeline's number because 
1.  it is more conservative
2.  the difference is small
3.  that some trader may not have put in a deal or volume management didn't path the deals correctly....anything is possible with the turnover we have had.

If you have reconciled the numbers and know where the difference is let me know.

Thanks

Stuart,
Chris recommends that we go with Bridgeline's number, as it is much more likely to be accurate at this point.  If Rita Wynne has time and it does not delay your efforts, you could have her attempt to reconcile the balance.
Ed 	

Per Anita Patton at Bridgeline - the balance is 1,930,552 dth.  Per Rita Wynne - ENA is showing a balance of 1,986,972 dth.

Thanks for the information.  The lady that I wanted to attend was out today.  Sorry for the head fake - my bad.  I am giving issue iv to Chris Germany to resolve.  The direction is good with me.  Thanks for your leadership on this one.
Regards,
Ed

Ed,

The person that you mentioned this morning failed to make it to our meeting .  Not a big deal but, as a result, I want to catch you up with where things are.  

We established that:
(i) it is going to be very difficult to determine a fair market value for the put option;
(ii) Greg Sharp is going to speak with McConnell this morning about obtaining the necessary support for buying the option;
(iii) Greg is going to determine all amounts currently owed (and past due) from Bridgeline to ENA; 
(iv) we need you to help us confirm the amount of gas in storage (Hugh Connett suggested that their numbers show about 1.93 BCF); 
(v) I am going to circle up with PWC and Blackstone (after hearing back from Greg) to talk about the deal and get their reactions; and
(vi) I am going to speak with Bridgeline on a preliminary basis about some of the deal terms (in particular (a) the option price, (b) doing the gas sale earlier and escrowing the proceeds, (c) mitigation of damages and how that mitigation should affect the amounts (both pre and post-petition) that are owed by ENA to Bridgeline and (d) increasing the amount payable for the gas in storage (because this deal is distinguishable from the pad gas sale in that we will be paying for the transport to move it)).

Let's visit on this when you get a moment.  Also please help me with item (iv) above.  Finally, I need you to tell me if you are OK with how this thing is shaping up.

Stuart

Let Kevin know about any suspected unpathed deals and he will get all over it.  This guy is going to be my boss someday.
 
 

There is nothing in Deal Volume Tracking regarding this deal.  I checked with Rita Wynne and she says it needs to be pathed.  As soon as that is done and I am notified, we can get the invoice out to MidAmerican.

Phil and I were just looking at some of the invoices created for March activity and I noticed the sale to MidAmerican Energy was not in his stack of invoices to review.  Would you see if we billed MidAmerican for March please?  The deal number is 1199439, the volume is 310,000 dth and the price is $2.47 per dth.  This was gas that the ENA Ontario desk had parked at Dawn.  There are more notes at the bottom of this email.
 
 
 
Good Job!  Please document the sale and the other bids, timing issues, costs, and any other factors that led to or affected the sale.  If you have any questions, please ask.
Ed

Just sold 10,000 MMBtu per day at Dawn to MidAmerican Energy Company at $2.47 for March.  My contact at MidAmerican is Dave Evans (515-281-2698).  Dave said he was using Apr Nymx + $.05 to calculate his price.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the  GST which is a per cent of the purchase price.  The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority.  In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.   If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated"  so it is not subject to the GST.
 
Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments?  I hope we still have someone who can do that.  
 
Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Opps.  Didn't mean to hit send it just yet.  Much better now.

Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal. 

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 

        1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to 
        2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address? 

Any comments or questions?

Hey Jeff, when are noms for the 1st due?

Thanks

Here is the rest of the information to fill in the below blanks:

a)  Gas prices at TCO's pool for spot gas trades for April 22, 2002 were $3.545 per Dth ---  the midpoint of Gas Daily's Columbia Appalachia price posting.  

b)  ENA did receive various letters from TCO addressing Section 9.5(c) notifications.  The first notice was dated November 28, 2002.  The other two letters memorialized conversations regarding ENA's creditworthiness.  I can fax these to you.

c)  EES appears to not have received letters regarding creditworthiness, or at least I can not find any correspondence.  Apparently, phone conversations did occur that related to the fact that if EES pays their bills that TCO would continue to allow them to do business.  EES has paid their post-petition invoices, with one exception, a billing dispute of $1000 to $1500 that was related to nominating on a contract that had been recalled by the releasing shipper without notice to EES.

d)  Due to the uncertainty of whether TCO was going to allow EES to use the capacity,  EES did not use their capacity in December.  EES did pay the invoice, however, as is noted on Exhibit H.

e)  For providing adequate assurances of performance,  EES did not have to put up anything special, like a guaranty or a letter of credit.  TCO has been requiring that EES maintain a minimum volume balance on EES's OBA, Operational Balancing Agreement, for their pool.  TCO has indicated that 71,766 Dth should be the minimum OBA balance for April 2002.  EES's OBA balance as of April 21, 2002 is 36,647 Dth.  Based on current forecasts, EES's ending OBA balance will be 46,876 Dth, so EES will have to go out and purchase additional supplies to maintain TCO's April 2002 minimum balance of  71,766 Dth.  This is the only thing that is happening that can be deemed a "frozen parking balance".

f)  We can not find the misplaced invoice that would nail down how much gas may be due ENA in Item #8.  Just go with at least 62,000 Dth.

g)  EES has not really been harmed in that they have been prevented in making sales.  Maintaining the minimum OBA balance has just increased their operating costs.

h)  On Ed's affidavit, the above changes need to be made.  Also please decide whether, the letters that I am faxing you really over-ride many of the notification arguments that you are trying to make.  

Ruth

---Original Message-----
I recommend that your draft response and Ed's affidavit be revised.  There are many inaccuracies in TCO's Round II Motion.  Here are my high level comments for:

TCO's Round II Motion

#1)  ENA's and EES's situation are completely different.

#2)  When TCO's Round I Motion was filed gas on TCO was supposedly trading at $2.285 per Dth on February 11, 2002.  Gas is now trading at around $3.60 - $3.70 per Dth.  This is not a typo.  Prices are up by over $1.30 per Dth since early February, but who knows how long they are going to stay there.  I will be able to get a better number on Monday morning.  By all these court delays, TCO has actually made us some money.

#3)  For the post-petition period, ENA has not been using its firm transportation contracts and has not paid TCO's invoices for PAL, FTS, OPT-60, or IGS (i.e. interruptible gathering service that is used to aggregate supply like the Dominion producers) -- See Exhibit C "ENA Chart".

#4)  ENA has two PALS agreements with stranded park balances (PAL K# 67401& PAL K# 70457); three temporary capacity release contracts that were acquired from several different parties (OPT-60 K# 71451 released from Commonwealth Atlantic Limited Partnership, FTS K# 70285 released from Columbia Energy Services Corporation & subsequently re-released back to New Power, FTS K# 70357 released from The New Power Company); one FTS agreement that originally was acquired from a third party (i.e. the marketing affiliate of TCO) and later converted over to ENA during the contract rollover process (FTS K# 70197); two FTS agreements that were acquired from TCO, the pipeline, through a capacity auction (FTS K# 67133 & FTS K# 67207); and one IGS agreement where additional commodity charges have been invoiced during the post-petition period -- Exhibit C.

#5)  Interestingly, Exhibit C does not show K# 71451, K# 70285 (demand & credit) are capacity relase deals acquired by ENA.  To the extent ENA does not pay, TCO should be billing the releasing shipper.  In fact, K# 71451 is the 40,000 Dth/d OPT-60 contract that has been referred to in the CALP, Commonwealth Atlantic Limited Partnership, Stipulation that Weil has already filed with the court.  The recall of this temporary capacity release contract occurred on March 20, 2002.  TCO should be billing CALP for both the pre-petition and the post-petition reservation charges not paid by ENA and the full charges from the effective date of the capacity recall.  By my count, those amounts are $131,063.20 pre-petition and $362,423.00 post-petition, or about 35% of TCO's pre-petition and post-petition claims -- ex. Paragraph 5, 8, 9...

#6) Paragraph 6 is misleading.  On November 30, 2001, ENA nominated a 10,000 Dth/d nomination for December 1st through 31st, or a total of 310,000 Dth, the entire balance of parked gas under PAL K# 67401.  This agreement was going to terminate on December 31, 2001 and ENA wanted to zero out the balance by the termination date.  TCO refused to accept the nominations so the ratable gas deliveries of 10,000 Dth/day for 31 days were not scheduled into ENA pooling account with TCO and could not be sold in the December 2001 spot gas market.  Interestingly, TCO continued to invoice ENA for the PAL charges even though TCO was holding our gas -- ex. Exhibit C.

#7)  ENA also tried to nominate a portion of the parked gas, 10,000 Dth/day, on January 2nd for Gas Day January 3rd deliveries.  Once again TCO did not accept ENA's nomination and no parked gas was scheduled for January 3rd.  The end result was that the parked gas could not be used as a source of gas supply to perform under an existing sales agreement with Columbia of Ohio, one of the many sales agreements in ENA's portfolio of contracts.

#8)  ENA continues to be invoiced commodity charges under the IGS agreement for the post-petition period.  This leads to the question, what has TCO done with ENA's gas that the small producers have been delivering into ENA's IGS agreement and why have we not seen any accounting of these volumes?  I am missing one month's invoice but I am guessing that the volumes should be around 62,000 to 77,000 Dth.  I will have to get this nailed down Monday morning.  Also, volumes that are non-gathered are aggregated separately.  TCO would have to provide this volume information.

#9)  For the post-petition period, EES has been using its FTS, SST, SIT and IGS contracts in order to continue to serve its markets.  EES has been paying the pipeline, either monthly or on a pre-pay basis  --  See Exhibit H "EES Chart"

#10)  I doubt the pipeline allowed EES to continue to do business without providing adequate assurances of performances -- ex. Paragraph 11, 21...  I will have to check on Monday what exactly was done.

#11)  Since EES has been using their capacity and paying their bills during the post-petition period, I do not understand how TCO can both accept nominations for EES's pool gas and freeze the pool balance simultaneously -- ex. Paragraph 12...  I will have to get more info from EES on Monday.

#12)  Value of pool gas should be at current conditions -- ex. Paragraph 13...  Exact opposite of the pricing support to the argument in Paragraph 21 has actually occurred.

#13)  Exhibit H shows the supposed $2,104,463.31 revenue that will be lost by TCO as a result of EES breaching its contracts.  Contract breach?  Once again, EES continues to use and pay the invoices for its contracts since the petition date.  Wouldn't it be likely for this situation to continue until the end of the terms of the agreements, or that these agreements could be assigned or released to another party if it is decided that EES terminates its retail sales off TCO -- ex. Paragraph 14... 

ENA's & EES's Response to TCO Round II Motion

#1)  Assuming I am correct on the EES pooling, ENA's and EES's situation are completely different and in the majority of the cases should not be lumped together generically as Debtors or the estate.

#2)  Loans are made for a variety of reasons (e.g. imbalance management, TCO wanting to reduce its current line pack or inventory, etc.) -- Paragraph 6...

#3)  Once again, holding EES's pool gas does not make sense since EES appears to be all paid up.  I will get this confirmed Monday morning -- Paragragh 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 21...

#4)  For the first time that we can recall, TCO is also using Sec 9.7 of their tariff to also address the issue of storage customers who are outside the contractual limitations of their storage agreements.  Chris Germany just sent out a notice where TCO announced a gas sales auction to sell off a small volume of gas that fell in this category.  The volume was so small, it is hard to believe that TCO could even see it in their day-to-day operations.  My guess is they are trying to set a precedent to make a point -- Paragraph 26, 27, 28, 29, 30...

#5)  Notices to suspend performance on account of non-payment?  I do not know if written notices were sent to ENA.  I will have to check Legal's termination letter file on Monday morning.  For EES, since they are paying I don't know how they can be included in this argument.  Chris and Robin both talked with TCO when the nominations were not accepted.  Supposedly, TCO verbally stated that the need for payment assurances was the reason the parked gas was not scheduled -- Paragraph 37, 38, 39... 

#6)  Paragraph 38 needs to be updated as described above in Item #6 and #7

Ed McMichael's Round II Affidavit

#1)  Paragraph 1, should you also include "EES"s"

#2)  Paragragh 4, see above information described in Item #6 and #7

#3)  Now that I have had a chance to read the Exhibits to Ed's Affidavit, Paragragh 5 as originally drafted looks fine.

#4)  Once again, I will get back to you on Paragraph 6

#5)  Once again, I will get back to you on Paragraph 9 and 11

Ilene Leahey is going to help print contracts from live-link.  She is from the local Andrews & Kurth office.  I have set her up at Julie Gomez's desk and she is using my id to print contracts.

She shouldn't need anything but if she does please help her. 

Thanks.
She is going to print all the Appalachian Producer contracts that she can pull up out of live-link from my master list.  I also asked Melissa if she could help and she said she would be glad too.  Let me know if that's ok.

What specifically is she going to do?  Which contracts?

Ed, per our discussion, an assistant from Shemin Proctor's Houston office is coming over tomorrow to help print contracts from live-link.

She will be over around 11 AM.  I am going to log into Julie Gomez's computer with my ID.

Let me know if you have any comments / concerns.

Thanks.

Chris,

Would you mind faxing to us a copy for our files (pretty please).

Our Fax # is 713-345-7374.....

Muchas Gracias!

Chris,
Thanks for the information.  We will supply MCV 1.  We will NOT supply MCV 2.  Please forward notices to Kay Mann and the file.

MCV faxed their May 2002 requirements to Kevin Brady.  MCV is requesting 6,800 dth per day on Trunkline (MCV I deal) and 15,000 dth per day on Trunkline, ANR, and Panhandle (MCV II deal).

I assume we are still physically serving the MCV I deal for 6,800 dth for May 2002.  Please let me know.

Does anyone need to see the notices from MCV?  I am going to send a copy for Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan and put a copy in our contract files here.

I am doing the noms on this one.

thx

You're nomin' this right???

Also wanted to make sure you were planning to keep the spreadsheet up-to-date too....

Please let us know if we need to do anything....happy to help!

We sold 10,000 dth of the Conger gas to TXU for 4/24 at $3.40

OK, Kathy and Troy have pointed out how bad my previous email was.  I'm sure I was thinking about lunch.

Sabra Dinari scheduled the gas on Lone Start.  She quit on Friday.  I will be doing the scheduling until further notice.  Kathy Kelly will be my backup when I'm out.

Sold 10,000 dth of Conger to TXU  for 4/23 at $3.37

Our scheduler, Sabra Dinari, quit on Friday so I will be handling the noms for awhile and Kathy Kelly will.  I think its easier for me to do the noms on this since I'm selling point specific gas and we are not putting this activity in Sitar/Unify.

Theresa, looks like I will be the one addressing the accounting questions.

I've sold TXU 10,000 dth at $3.14 for Sat.4/20 through Mon. 4/22

Sabra, I sold them 10,000 of Conger gas

Sold TXU 15,000 dth at $3.315 for Fri 4/19/02.  

Sabra, I sold them 10,000 of Conger gas and 5,000 of the Sprayberry.  

Sold TXU 10,000 dth at $3.17 for Thur 4/18/02.  I checked on the price with Darren Farmer at AEP and he said that's where Waha was trading so I don't feel like we are being taken advantage of too much.

Sold TXU 10,000 dth at $3.27 for Wednesday 4/17/02.

What is the status of the Dominion issue?
Thanks

Chris / Shemin / Ruth,

Here's a brief recap of what happened on the Dominion issues from the EES side. I would like to get an idea of where we stand with them now and make sure I coordinate with the ENA counsel and ENA's position with Dominion. Basically I want to make sure we address our "frozen" storage and decide how best to resolve the local producers issue ( when to pay and from what date ).

	Basically the chronology from the EES is as follows :

Prior to Dec 2001, EES had storage capacity and Dominion transport released to us from Niagara Mohawk ( NIMO) for our customers behind that LDC. Over the summer of 2001 we injected approx. 680,000 dthms which should be worth $2.4 MM now.
Upon declaration of bankruptcy NIMO terminated our ability to serve customers behind the LDC as a result of the NY PUC ruling.
Also upon bankruptcy Dominion Transmission terminated all our transportation contracts including the transport for the storage capacity we had from NIMO. Dominion then took the position that our gas was frozen and could be used as an offset against the amounts we owed them.
Marshall Turner and Melanie turner of Weil Gotshal have been in discussions with the counsel for Dominion, Bill Saviers ( Internal ) Paul Vrana and Bruce Ruzinsky of Jackson Walker ( external )
One of the issues in dispute is whether Dominion can offset the value of our storage gas against payables due from ENA. I don't know if this has been resolved.

David is going to send us an email with as much information that he can remember regarding the storage contract on Dominion, including any lawyers EES worked with back in December.

 <<92860_1.DOC>>
Chris,
Please call me once you have looked at these questions and let me know
what additional questions we should ask Dominion.  Thanks.

you know the talking part is hard because its so quiet here and i know some people just listen to other folks conversation to see whats going on.  it makes it a little harder to chat and I'm kinda self conscious about it.  i don't know why it seems so awkward here and not in the other building.

oh well,  YOU ARE MY HONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

good luck.  when is comes to daycares.  it probably good to look at quite a few to have a sense of what's out there.  another place you could look is   st. andrews presb.  at buffalo speedway and bissonet.  when i looked at that place it was for a three year old and it appeared very nurturing.  it is or was an accredited facility. 
Barbe, Robin says:
that facility really didn't have much of an academic program.  at this age it doesn't matter but i nicer to have them in an environment that fits all needs now and later,.  it better not to move kids alot.

Sold 10,000 dth of Conger to TXU  for 4/23 at $3.37

Our scheduler, Sabra Dinari, quit on Friday so I will be handling the noms for awhile and Kathy Kelly will.  I think its easier for me to do the noms on this since I'm selling point specific gas and we are not putting this activity in Sitar/Unify.

Theresa, looks like I will be the one addressing the accounting questions.

I've sold TXU 10,000 dth at $3.14 for Sat.4/20 through Mon. 4/22

Sabra, I sold them 10,000 of Conger gas

Sold TXU 15,000 dth at $3.315 for Fri 4/19/02.  

Sabra, I sold them 10,000 of Conger gas and 5,000 of the Sprayberry.  

Sold TXU 10,000 dth at $3.17 for Thur 4/18/02.  I checked on the price with Darren Farmer at AEP and he said that's where Waha was trading so I don't feel like we are being taken advantage of too much.

Sold TXU 10,000 dth at $3.27 for Wednesday 4/17/02.

Heres the spreadsheet I keep on the Lonestar nom, the points have been the same all month so far.

 

I just spoke with Theresa Vos.  She handles the accounting for these deals and she said they have to do everything outside the system because ENA is not collecting the slaes revenue or making the payments to the suppliers.  Joe was very concerned about putting deals in Sitara because he was afraid that we might double bill TXU.  There is also a problem with the Feb activity because TXU recorded all the activity as ENA activity instead of Ponderosa Pine activity.  It also appears that TXU withholds payments for the smallest indiscretions in the billing too.  We can chat about that next week.

Sabra, do you know what points Apache/Cinergy and Williams is giving us the gas at?  I'd like to see that if possible.

Thanks

I'm taking off Friday.  

yes, I am basically handling any "old" wholesale business which for now includes the FGT/Citrus, Lonestar and some Enron Compressor stuff on TW.  I do have a Sitara ticket that we are updating for the sale to TXU, just let me know the price and I'll update it.  I'm updating the supply tickets, I believe its a long term deal...I don't know all the details about all this.  Is Joe Parks leaving or something, why are you doing all this stuff now?

FYI:  I call it the Cleburne Plant and it is at the same point as it was for the first 3 days of the month.  The scheduler over there calls me every morning to verify.

Sabra

I don't know if I should call this the Ponderosa Pine plant, the Cleburne Plant, or what.  Think I'll refer to it as Cleburne.

Sabra, Joe Parks told me that you handling Lone Start in the future.  

I sold 10,000 dth to TXU for tomorrow.  I believe we have sold TXU 10,000 dth everyday this month so far.  Lyn at TXU asked me if the gas was at the same point for tomorrow and I told her "sure" and I have no idea what points our gas is coming from.

I don't know how much time we need to spend on this.  But, I have not put anything in Sitara and I don't know if I should.  I believe Theresa Voss's (on 3 in Enron Center South) group is handling the accounting for this and I don't know what they need.  I'm going to try and meet her today.

Sabra, are you handling this?  Let me know.  If you are, do you want/need/care if this is in Sitara and Unify?  I believe all of the activity for this deal flowed through ENA before bankruptcy.  Now, I believe the partnership makes all the payments and billings and they probably pay ENA a fee.  Joe made it very clear that ENA is NOT supposed to send out an invoice.

thx
chris

sounds good to me

how about getting together monday at 2 pm to discuss the juniper transition?  let me know.

When: Wednesday, April 17, 2002 11:30 AM-12:30 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).

Weekly Natural Gas Storage 

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) has updated weekly estimates of
natural gas in underground storage for the United States and three regions.  The
weekly data are currently available on EIA's website at:
http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/ngs/ngs.html

The web site contains the most recent estimates and provides a link to a
spreadsheet of prior weekly storage estimates. The estimates will be released
regularly between 10:30 a.m. and 10:40 a.m. (Eastern time) on Thursdays, except
for certain weeks with Federal holidays. A schedule for holiday weeks through
calendar year 2002 is available at
http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/ngs/schedule.html.

Rita,

I am mailing you the original Columbia Gas invoices for Feb and Mar and a copy of what I have for December.  I don't have the January invoices and I have requested a copy from Jeanne Adkins assistant at Columbia Gas.  I will also ask to have these sent to your attention in the future.

I gave Maria a copy of everything I'm mailing to you.

Thanks

Kathy said some Mobil traders created National Energy And Trade after Mobil let go of a bunch of people.  I guess you know that both Molly and Chris worked for Mobil.  By the way I did the math on Sabra.

$400 x 7 months = $2,800.00

$3,733.33 / 75% = $3,733.33

$3,733.33 / 5% = $74,666.67

Thanks for the info.  I voted to get that sucker lowered to 45 and 10,000 of my closest friends are doing the same thing.

Good Morning!  I love taking Fridays off.

I see Kathy sold 10,000 dth for the weekend.  Let me know what you want to sell for tomorrow.  If I don't hear from you by 8:00 AM C.T.  I'll just sell 10,000 dth.

thanks

These are funny.  I thought it might be enron photos at first.

Kathy, we have a deal on Trunkline where Midland can request up to an additional 1,700 per day and it could be just 1 day over the weekend too.  Reliant has storage that can flow into Trunkline Wla.  We don't have a pricing mechanism in place so its pretty much automatic and Reliant can bill us whatever they want.  If it ever happens on the weekend, Jim and I will discuss the pricing the following Monday.  Its only happened once in the last 2 months but YOU NEVER KNOW, especially if it happens on the weekend.

If I remember correctly, Midland would call Kevin and Kevin would call Reliant.  Are we sill set up that way?

I've requested a $17,000.00 wire to be made tomorrow and we still have a cash balance of $54,820.00.

I'll be out of the office tomorrow so Kathy Kelly will be handling our activity.  Her number is 713-853-5858.

Thanks and have a good weekend.

 

PNM Gas Services was terminated on 12/7/01.  Same as the previous email where there are Trk Nom and Schd volumes in Unify but nothing in Sitara.

 

<Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)>

Deal 1035543, a sale to Giant Refining Company, was terminated effective 12/1/01.  It looks like the Trk Nom and Schd volumes should be taken out.

i would just call oxy and ask them.  there's no sneaky stuff anymore and its not like we would send them their money back either.

what's your recommendation on how to proceed with margaret or internally?  i need to find out what the money is for.  i could always call over to oxy and ask my commerical person about it

if the counterpart is in cash disbursements then yes, if its an accountant in an operational area then they should know what its for.

from your vast experience do you think this is true?

Somebody around here must know what they are for.  Our counterparts at OXY wouldn't likely know.  
Margaret

i spoke with bjorn i credit and he wasn't able to figure it out.  could you or someone is accounting discretely call oxy and inquire about the two payments?

Disregard the 10, 997,000. I found out what that was
The receipts from Occidental were as follows

$10,124,373.52  on March 22, 2002
$  4,996,973.98 on March 22, 2002

Sold TXU 10,000 dth at $3.27 for Wednesday 4/17/02.

Thanks

I think I have access to everything now.

thanks

I just got a call from Kevin Hyatt, Director of Marketing at TW.  He said that Sempra just called him and wanted to know why WE locked the points on the contract in our posting.  I told him we locked them because we didn't want to get billed a potentially higher rate.

1)  This guy acted like he knew me and of course I was embarrassed so I acted like I knew him, AND I DON'T EVER REMEMBER TALKING TO THIS GUY.  He knew that I had gone to EES and that was back in 1997-1998.

2)  Sempra told Kevin that we would get more value if we let someone change the points.  I wonder, even though we might get billed max rate, would it be possible to allow the replacement shipper to change the points for "the term of the release only AND the releasing shipper would be billed more that max rate" and that way the capacity would go back to its original contract points in October.

Just a thought.  

yes i did.  Friday April 19th.  Well their we go, I've made my 1(00,000) mistake for the year and I'm all out.  Nothin' but perfection from now on.

I am requesting a prepayment of $17,000 to be paid to Reliant for Friday April 18th.

Priscilla, let me know when you have the wire ready and I'll come get it OR you can leave it on my desk at ECN0604c.

Doug, are you still on 4 in the new building?:

 << File: Reliant Prepay (2.8.02).doc >> 

not unless EES had some TCO storage we were not aware of.  They would be doing something with 620,000 if they were fooling with our stuff.

Is this ours???

I didn't call to check on this but I've never seen an email like this from CGAS.  I just thought it was interesting.

Insurance and benefit questions

My girlfriend and I are expecting a baby and the due date is May 7th.  She
works for Williams and I work for Ed McMichael in the estate group.

We are currently living together but we have no immediate plans to get
married.  Also, she plans on taking off 6 months after the baby is born.
According to my girlfriends HR rep, her insurance will cover her for 12
weeks from the date the baby is born, after that she has to sign up for
COBRA.

These are my questions

When can I cover the baby under my insurance?

Will there be any problems moving the baby's coverage to her insurance
beginning 1/1/2003?

Can I cover my girlfriend under my insurance during her leave of absence
from Williams?

This deal probably should not be in Sitara.  Its related to sales made by the Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners, Ltd. to TXU.  This activity used to handled by the Texas Desk.  If Feb 2002, it was decided that all activity should flow through the partnership instead of ENA.  I took all prices on this deal to 0.

Max, would you call Tiffanie Wheeler at Reliant to discuss the volume discrepancy on 2/27/02.  Her number is 713-207-6790.  I believe she said that if we provide them with pipeline support from Tallahassee, they will adjust our bill.  

Thanks.

Keep me posted.

Chris,

Pam at the City of Tallahassee sent me her volume reports for February 2002.
There are two adjustments that will be made to their invoice.

The base volume will be increased from 100,000 dth to 104,793 dth.
This will increase our supply with Dominion which I believe you have been informed
by Dominion as well.
The Swing gas for 2/27/02 will be reduced by 450 to 1,550 due to an operational scheduling cut
from the Reliant pool.  The City of Tallahassee has already deducted this from their payment on
the original invoice.  In summary, I will be preparing an additional invoice to the City of Tallahassee
in the amount of $14,570.72.  I will let you know when payment is received on this adjustment.

Don't forget my State of Florida adjustments!

Thanks,
Max

She is going to print all the Appalachian Producer contracts that she can pull up out of live-link from my master list.  I also asked Melissa if she could help and she said she would be glad too.  Let me know if that's ok.

What specifically is she going to do?  Which contracts?

Ed, per our discussion, an assistant from Shemin Proctor's Houston office is coming over tomorrow to help print contracts from live-link.

She will be over around 11 AM.  I am going to log into Julie Gomez's computer with my ID.

Let me know if you have any comments / concerns.

Thanks.

Chris,

The mids are for last Friday and not for the month in question. We have not set physical curves for the summer as of yet. Let me know if you need anything else.

Pat

Here are the forwards details on all the physical deals for May and June.  Let me know if there's anything else I can do.

Thanks,

Jon asked some lady to call me back and she didn't know either.  At first she did it the way you show it on your worksheet.  Then when I told her that normal demand charges ( a 1 year deal at max for example) are the same each month regardless of how many days there are in the month she got confused.  I guess we will find out when we get the invoice.  

Hi Jon.

We just spoke on the phone and I work with Ruth Concannon and Maria Garza on the Enron Estate Team.

I'm trying to calculate the demand charge on the following capacity release

Offer #20275
Released to Enserco
Term	4/8/02 to 4/30/02
MDQ	20,0000
demand rate  $1.30

Please call me when you get a chance at 713-853-4743.

Melissa verified our payment on Friday so that makes our estimated current cash balance is $61,790.00 after purchasing gas for tomorrow.

 

FYI
nope, will try to get to it today but I am still working on pathing Socalgas for March on the retail side, high priority.

Priscilla said Mid American just called her and said they won't pay us until they receive an invoice.  Have you pathed this yet?
 
Let me know.
 
thx

I think it needs to be pathed in Unify.  Here's the problem.  I created a sales deal ticket and Kim and I didn't know if the supply just needed to come from imbalance or if I needed to create a one sided exchange ticket.  I have no idea how the ontario desk handled it in the past.  They probably were not consistent any.  Would you path this?
 
Just take you best shot on how to do it.  I think we are going to have quite a few things like this.  I'm trying to figure out how to put in a sales deal ticket for Jan 2002 on Montanna Power which is in the west.

Chrissy, is there something I need to be doing with this?  I've never heard of any of this stuff....

Phil and I were just looking at some of the invoices created for March activity and I noticed the sale to MidAmerican Energy was not in his stack of invoices to review.  Would you see if we billed MidAmerican for March please?  The deal number is 1199439, the volume is 310,000 dth and the price is $2.47 per dth.  This was gas that the ENA Ontario desk had parked at Dawn.  There are more notes at the bottom of this email.
 
 
 
Good Job!  Please document the sale and the other bids, timing issues, costs, and any other factors that led to or affected the sale.  If you have any questions, please ask.

Just sold 10,000 MMBtu per day at Dawn to MidAmerican Energy Company at $2.47 for March.  My contact at MidAmerican is Dave Evans (515-281-2698).  Dave said he was using Apr Nymx + $.05 to calculate his price.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the  GST which is a per cent of the purchase price.  The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority.  In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.   If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated"  so it is not subject to the GST.
 
Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments?  I hope we still have someone who can do that.  
 
Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal. 

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 

        1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to 
        2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address?

Leon Payne, Ingrid's boss at Transco is resigning for personal reasons.  That kind of came as a surprise to everyone over there.  They supposedly have a reorg thing going on over there too.  Don't know if that's it or not.   The lease at the tower is up ?next year? I think.  The new CEO said staying in the tower is their first choice but they want to lease 20 floors instead of 40.  If that doesn't work, then they may move West to Beltway 8 somewhere.

Hi Jon.

We just spoke on the phone and I work with Ruth Concannon and Maria Garza on the Enron Estate Team.

I'm trying to calculate the demand charge on the following capacity release

Offer #20275
Released to Enserco
Term	4/8/02 to 4/30/02
MDQ	20,0000
demand rate  $1.30

Please call me when you get a chance at 713-853-4743.

Looks like a pain in the ass girl.  Let's see, that would make 2 in my household.

Hey you...

Thought this was interesting...check it out. Not that it's true...but its nice to speculate.

http://www.babynet.com/tools/chinacalendar/chinchart1.htm

 

Good morning!

Would you let me know if you received a wire from Enron on Friday april 12th please?  The amount was $22,000.00.

Thanks

No flying, my brother and I have a pontoon boat.  It has a potty on so I think it will work.  Next Wed it is.

are we traveling?  you are still taking your flying lessons and are flying me over?  yes, we are on!!

I love you.  You are mine then for lunch on Wed.  We can discuss a place later.

re lunch.  i can do any day next week except mon or tues.  and any day the following week.

actually, they made me an offer on monday, 4/01 and i left on holiday on tuesday.  i did go in that tues am to see if i could get more $ from them, of course the pay/bo is less than here.  they didn't think there was anything they could do.

got back into office on wed.  played phone tag all wed.  they called me thurs [yesterday] right before lunch and said could give me a very nice sign on bonus...but nothing more to my base pay.  thought hard about it, and decided to accept, which i did yesterday.  they sent a letter over this pm and then went in to talk to jesus.

i am part of the liquidation pool, but do not feel comfortable at all that they are really going to pay me.  you know, if we sell $3 B you get xxx.  but there is no way we are going to sell exactly $3B.  and you have NO IDEA what you get if they sell $2 B or $3.5B.... and there is way too much loosiness involved in all of this, no letter stating anything, plus no trust on my part, that i don't think they will come thru.  and of course, now you have the SEC thing going on.  grrrr.

nope and nope

Baby is due May 7th but my womand is HUGH and I don't think she's gonna make it.  Kathy just told me.  I'm happy for you.  Did you listen to the retention talk first or were you already out the door mentally?

I wanna do lunch with you.  When can you pencil me in?  I'm out next Friday and half of next Tuesday.

gosh, i was going to email you, but i suppose kathy beat me to it.  are you married yet?  or a daddy?

sniff sniff

phone:  713-667-7155     hours 7:00 am - 6:00 pm

they have an opening in the fall at bethany starting sep 3. they have a 4 to 1 ratio and are an accredited school.  the have 3 baby classes,  one for 2 to 4 month olds, one for 4 to 6 months old and a one for more active babies to toddlers.  they move babies based on development not necessarily age.   they require one month security deposit which gets applied to your last month as long as you give 30 days notice.  the fees are as follows:  $100 new family fee, $815/month, three "grounds and equipment fees"  one in the fall $155, one in the spring $155 and one in the summer $135.  

if you are interested in them you should go and tour the faciliity.  they officially give tours thurs mornings.  however, she said that i you call the day before or first thing in the morning they cover give an impromptu tour.

good luck

I'll copy you, but it is Ponderosa sending out the bills correct?

Chris,

So far no payment from TXU. We probably should set up something with Apache and Williams but essentially we are selling their own gas back to them!!

Please copy me on your spreadsheet for April activity and I'll make sure TXU gets billed correctly.

MM

I want to send out an email showing the TXU sales for the month.  I'm going to copy TXU and kinda use this as an informal confirmation of the monthly activity.  I just want to verify that it is Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners, Ltd. billing TXU correct?

Also, have we received payment for Feb yet?  If not, I would question whether TXU is really going to pay, its starting to sound like a stall technique.  If we need someone else to sell the gas too, we might set up contracts with Apache and Williams and start selling the gas back to them.  Then you would at least have some purchases to net the sales with.

Just a thought before I hop off to lunch.

I just created deal 1204869 per the notes in o:/Gas Structuring/Bankruptcy/Storage Inventory/Daily Inventory Update.xls, an ENA sale to PanCanadian Energy Services Inc with the following details;
Price:		$2.25
Volume:	1,121,702
Location:	MPC/Dry Creek Storage/2-02125-1

Rita, there is a storage contract 7010 in Unify for MPC.  I assume this is the contract that needs to be pathed in Unify to withdraw the storage gas.  Do you get any statements from MPC?

  

Doesn't look like tickets were ever entered in the system.  I've requested access to change the tickets.  I'll send a new email once I enter the deal.

Thanks

Let me know if you see any other missing items too.

I think it needs to be pathed in Unify.  Here's the problem.  I created a sales deal ticket and Kim and I didn't know if the supply just needed to come from imbalance or if I needed to create a one sided exchange ticket.  I have no idea how the ontario desk handled it in the past.  They probably were not consistent any.  Would you path this?
 
Just take you best shot on how to do it.  I think we are going to have quite a few things like this.  I'm trying to figure out how to put in a sales deal ticket for Jan 2002 on Montanna Power which is in the west.

Chrissy, is there something I need to be doing with this?  I've never heard of any of this stuff....

Phil and I were just looking at some of the invoices created for March activity and I noticed the sale to MidAmerican Energy was not in his stack of invoices to review.  Would you see if we billed MidAmerican for March please?  The deal number is 1199439, the volume is 310,000 dth and the price is $2.47 per dth.  This was gas that the ENA Ontario desk had parked at Dawn.  There are more notes at the bottom of this email.
 
 
 
Good Job!  Please document the sale and the other bids, timing issues, costs, and any other factors that led to or affected the sale.  If you have any questions, please ask.
Ed

Just sold 10,000 MMBtu per day at Dawn to MidAmerican Energy Company at $2.47 for March.  My contact at MidAmerican is Dave Evans (515-281-2698).  Dave said he was using Apr Nymx + $.05 to calculate his price.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the  GST which is a per cent of the purchase price.  The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority.  In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.   If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated"  so it is not subject to the GST.
 
Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments?  I hope we still have someone who can do that.  
 
Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Do you know the answer to the tax question, or at least who to ask?

Opps.  Didn't mean to hit send it just yet.  Much better now.

Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal. 

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 

        1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to 
        2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address? 

Any comments or questions?

Oh yeah, I'm looking good now.  I found some 5 year old "Tan in a Can" and spread it all over.  It caused a small rash in a couple of spots but I brushed those up in the photo.

Promises!  Promises!

You better believe it.  I'll bring my photos for the "magazine" shoot.

Unify shows some production in November and December on CNG Appalachia.  Small producer.  We owe $539.35 for November and $338.40 for December.  Unless there is value we are not paying December production and of course we are not paying November.  The points on CNG are #4281001 and $4371101.  Let me know what I can do - maybe give the customer my number to call.
 
Do you see any payables to Elvis Energy?

Chris, a woman from Elvis Energy is calling about some unpaid invoices, but I don't know anything about this project.  Kay Mann suggested that I contact you for possible help.

When you get the price for the 10,000 dth we are selling you for Friday, would you send it via email.  I forward that info to 3 different people.

Thanks

Our current cash balance with Reliant is $52,850.00.  We did not request any gas for tomorrow under the swing arrangements.  I have requested a wire in the amount of $22,000.00 to be made on Friday April 12th.

Melissa, I had to move the payment to Friday because some Enron "approval" people are out of the office but we have a large cash balance and it shouldn't be a problem if it gets delayed untill Monday.

Also, Tiffanie Wheeler discovered an error in my worksheet that impacted the cash balance effective March 1st forward.  My worksheet is set up so that any change in a volume or price for a prior month will change the current cash balance.  I will keep track of all changes at the bottom of the Summary worksheet in this file.

 

My girlfriend and I are having a baby soon.  The due date is May 7th.  I have some questions regarding what my insurance and benefit options are.  Would you tell me who I should speak with please?

Thanks

Do you see any payables to Elvis Energy?

Chris, a woman from Elvis Energy is calling about some unpaid invoices, but I don't know anything about this project.  Kay Mann suggested that I contact you for possible help.

Don't know about this but I am handling the activity for the Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners, Ltd. (a.k.a. Cleburne Plant, a.k.a. Tenaska Power Partners) on Lone Star Pipeline.  We have a large imbalance on the transport contract that I'm slowly working off but that's about it.  

Are you guys aware of any storage?  I'm going to call Joe Parks later and see if he was working on anything related to storage other then Centana.  I also have a contact at  Lone Star that I could ask but I rather see if what we know form the inside first.

I'm not aware of anything like that.  I'll ask around.

	Chris,

	I was working on a storage deal for a Lone Star pipeline when things blew up. I know that there was a 
	rather large imbalance to the tune of about 800,000 dth in EES's name. I was just following up to see
	if any actions had been taken to utilize or liquidate this asset.

	Critz Smith

fyi,

you guys can really help your child in the future by giving her lots of sensory input.  by sensory input i mean:  swaddling, stroking down her arms, legs and back  with different textures.  (diffferent types of fabric, ie, satin, terry cloth, knit etc....)  there is also a sensory brush but i don't know about it's use on babies.

the reason i say this is that my  children both have a sensory deficiency.  my little one, jerald, goes to occupational therapy once  a week for sensory input.  which is really nothing more than alot of fun play activities that incorporate the senses.  

in the information i was given to read for jerald,  they mentioned a link between c-section babies and sensory deficiits.  they claim that alot of sensory input occurs when the baby is pushed through and out of the birth canal which c-section babies obviously miss.  i don't know how true this is but the sensory input can't hurt her.

Hey Uncle, 
Thank you guys for the email and thanks for coming to the ordination ceremony.  How did your interview go?  We will be in town this Monday or Tuesday night.  Tuesday would probably be easier on us, because we will be driving back in from Dallas on Monday, but either would work fine.

I can't find any of the reports that Kim Olinger used to run out of Unify.  BUT, Jeanne Wukasch was in Kim's group and she would know how to run them.  I believe they were called Service P&L reports.  The only thing we would use them for now are transport demand charges.

I'm available anytime except around 9:00 AM every morning.

You were on the phone when I came by so I left the TXU shipper imbalance statement in your inbox this morning before lunch.  This is for gas being delivered to the Cleburne plant.

Melissa just confirmed that Reliant received ENA's wire last Thursday.  Thanks Melissa.  Tallahassee requested 0 volumes for tomorrow so our current cash balance is $66,270.00.

Thanks.

 

This is the info I gave El Paso.  Its probably ok to use this.

I have confirmation of the wire received for the $2.7 million from Duke for the storage sale.  It is attached.

Crhis

The invoice for $3,151,4550.05 is on SAP 3000012785

I found a payment from Duke Energy Field Services to settle storage fees due post bankruptcy dated 3/229/02.  These funds are on SAP 3000006586 in the amount of $2,735,550.05 - short from the invoice of $416,000.00

I have screen prints on each and will bring them to you and turn over to the appropriate party.

Thanks

Larry

Priscilla was asking me if we ever paid for the Centanna storage that we sold to Duke Energy Field Services, LP.

I see that deal 1203368 was entered in Sitara on April 1, 2002 by Joe Parks.  The deal is a sale of 1,006,885 dth to Duke Energy Field Services at $3.13 on 3/30/02.  This is showing up in A/R as an outstanding receivable and Priscilla is wondering if the cash may be sitting in another account or different Duke entity.

Any ideas?

Susan,

I got your email address from Scott Goodell.  I hope things are going well for you and I don't know if you are working or staying at home so this may be a non event.

CMS Energy is trying to develop a presence in the North East.  A headhunter set me up with an interview at CMS last Friday.  I spoke with Curt Lizzi, Vice President of Wholesale Gas Trading.  I don't know why he agreed to see me because 30 min into the interview he said I wasn't what he was looking for.  He wants someone with contacts and cash trading experience.  He said he hopes to be looking for someone like me in about a year.  You just never know.  His number is 713-230-7205.

Let me know how things are going.  ME??  just focused on living in sin with a pregnant girlfriend.

we've been trying to sell about 5000 of imbalance gas a day.  lone star is aware of it and approves.

Just curious, what are we doing with the Lone Star imbalance?  Given that our contract price is in the money and we've already paid for the gas sitting on the pipe, is there a trade to be made with Lone Star?

I sold 6,000 dth to TXU at $3.18 for tomorrow.

ship it to the plant

what are we going to do with the extra 4,000?

we have been selling txu 10,000 day on lone star since the 1st.  for tomorrow we are selling them 6,000 instead of 10,000 

is this incremental or did baseload go down?  if incremental, who did you purchase it from or are we taking down what we're delivering to Kleburne plant?  details please...

Sabe

I sold 6,000 dth to TXU at $3.18 for tomorrow.

I don't think I ever had the invoices.  All I had were the statments showing the balance in the park and loans.

Hey again...

Do you have the Sonat invoices...if so I would like to see them.

Let me know.

Thanks

Ruth, remember that moorning you "allegedly" called me from Shemin's office last week?  You said you were meeting with Shemin and wouldn't be in for awhile.  I told you to ask Shemin "What the hell is going on with Dominion?  What's the latest?".  Well that's what this is.  Never got me an answer on that now did you?  I'm betting you and Shemin were at the Waffle House smokin'  cig's, drinking coffee, and eating hash browns that were "covered" with cheese and filled with "chunks" of ham

Shemin, how about an update on Dominion?  What's the word?

Ruth,
Have you spoken with Chris? He has been leading the Dominion team from a
commercial perspective and has been coordinating with EES.

Price for April 6-8th  is $3.13

Lynn, we would like to roll the deal we've been doing all week.  For the

My last email on Sonat Park and Loan.

Chris,

I am faxing copies of Jan. 2002 and Feb. 2002 Sonat invoices to Maria.  I do see the balances on #1 and #2 on the Jan. 2002 statements.  It looks like we received 77,292 mmbtus back on contract PSNG2194 leaving a balance of 188,949 on deal #1222.  There was no activity for Jan. 2002 on contract PAL1001,deal 1424.  We were charged a total of $19,043.73 for the remaining volumes in storage ($.00305 per day).  Please let me know if there is anything else that I need to do.  

Thanks,

Rita x37694

Still not sure about the actual volumes for items 1 and 3 below but we did confirm that Sonat did not pay us for the volumes delivered in Jan 2002.

Mark, I assume you are the person Sonat will be contacting.  Here are some items to consider,

	1.  Park balance on deal #1222  188,949 dth ( + or - 10,000 dth)
	2.  Loan balance on deal #1424  (96,000) dth
	3.  ENA sold Sonat 496,000 dth at $2.885 for Jan 2002 and did not deliver 418,708 dth (+ or - 10,000 dth, related to Item #1)
	4.  ENA sold Sonat 310,000 dth at $2.955 for May 2002, I don't know if this deal has been terminated or not.

Rita, Maria and I are looking for the Sonat pipeline statements for Jan 2002.  We have Dec 2001.  Would you see if you have those and let one of us know please?  Sonat may have stopped sending us statements, but this would answer my volume questions on items 1 and 3.

Margaret, could you see if Sonat paid us for 77,292 dth x $2.885 = $222,987.42 for the sale in Jan 2002?  I would be very surprised if they did.
	

3/14/02 
10:25 am

Barbara Gilbert, my scheduling rep. at Sonat, informed me that the attorneys in Sonat's Houston office will be contacting Enron's attorneys to set up a meeting to address the PAL issue.   .  

Christina Sanchez

3/14/02
9:50 AM Per Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent.  Tammi spoke to Lisa Guthrie (205-325-3816) at Sonat to find out what flexibility Sequent would have taking out the parked gas.  Lisa said she didn't know if Enron could sell the gas.

Thanks for the information.  Sell, Sell, Sell!  Sell it all to Sequent for March if you can get a good bid and have them agree to pay the moment we/they get confirmation on the nomination.  Try to get other bids to validate as best you can.  Do not talk to Sonat unless you have to - - asking permission is not advisable.  

Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat.  This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.

ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract.  Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it.  I need to know;

1.  What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.
2.  What period do I sell the gas for?  All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline?  Or base load in April?  I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?
3.  How many bids do I need to get?  I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.
4.  This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).

Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas.  I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.

All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.

Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. 

2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat 
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

2/25/02
Per Kay Mann - Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract.
1:10 PM.  Left a follow-up message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on 2/20/02.

3/11/02
Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal.  Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.

3/13/02
Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled.  Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID.  Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.
3:30 PM  Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it.  She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination.  I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out.
3:40 PM  Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department.

I would like to make everyone aware of who does what regarding the Cleburne / Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners / Tenaska plant on Lone Star Pipeline.

Good thing you mentioned that.  I can see that the attachment on this email is different than the one I sent before.  I will be sending out another email this afternoon just introducing the "Enron" team to each other.

check on getting some gas medicine from the drug store, its over the counter stuff for babies.

I just spoke with Theresa Vos.  She handles the accounting for these deals and she said they have to do everything outside the system because ENA is not collecting the slaes revenue or making the payments to the suppliers.  Joe was very concerned about putting deals in Sitara because he was afraid that we might double bill TXU.  There is also a problem with the Feb activity because TXU recorded all the activity as ENA activity instead of Ponderosa Pine activity.  It also appears that TXU withholds payments for the smallest indiscretions in the billing too.  We can chat about that next week.

Sabra, do you know what points Apache/Cinergy and Williams is giving us the gas at?  I'd like to see that if possible.

Thanks

I'm taking off Friday.  

yes, I am basically handling any "old" wholesale business which for now includes the FGT/Citrus, Lonestar and some Enron Compressor stuff on TW.  I do have a Sitara ticket that we are updating for the sale to TXU, just let me know the price and I'll update it.  I'm updating the supply tickets, I believe its a long term deal...I don't know all the details about all this.  Is Joe Parks leaving or something, why are you doing all this stuff now?

FYI:  I call it the Cleburne Plant and it is at the same point as it was for the first 3 days of the month.  The scheduler over there calls me every morning to verify.

Sabra

I don't know if I should call this the Ponderosa Pine plant, the Cleburne Plant, or what.  Think I'll refer to it as Cleburne.

Sabra, Joe Parks told me that you handling Lone Start in the future.  

I sold 10,000 dth to TXU for tomorrow.  I believe we have sold TXU 10,000 dth everyday this month so far.  Lyn at TXU asked me if the gas was at the same point for tomorrow and I told her "sure" and I have no idea what points our gas is coming from.

I don't know how much time we need to spend on this.  But, I have not put anything in Sitara and I don't know if I should.  I believe Theresa Voss's (on 3 in Enron Center South) group is handling the accounting for this and I don't know what they need.  I'm going to try and meet her today.

Sabra, are you handling this?  Let me know.  If you are, do you want/need/care if this is in Sitara and Unify?  I believe all of the activity for this deal flowed through ENA before bankruptcy.  Now, I believe the partnership makes all the payments and billings and they probably pay ENA a fee.  Joe made it very clear that ENA is NOT supposed to send out an invoice.

thx

FYI, MCV swing activity on Trunkline, not ANR.  Monday, March 19th was the last conversation we had with MCV regarding this swing gas.

Chris,

      I spoke with Rochelle from MCV on Monday morning roughly 9:30am, and she went into her system and verified to me that we did not cut them, that they did receive the 8500mm's that they requested on Sunday March 18th. She assured me that they received all volumes they requested.

Kevin S. Brady

You are my hero buddy. 

And you think I should get married?   FYI  while everyone else has been stressed out about work, I've been focused (VERY STRESSED OUT) with more personal issues.  Every time I ask for some kind of sign, someone comes along and tells me I should get married.

Hmmmm.

Take care and best of luck to you and the family.

The prepay to Reliant for Thur April 4th is $37,000.  I left the Cash Request on Doug's desk.

 

Our current cash balance after purchasing gas for the 4th is $43,350.  I've requested a prepayment of $37,000 to be wired tomorrow afternoon.  

Have a good day!

 

ok

I was still talking to you!  I didn't realize we'd disconnected.  See you

Just a quick note on the information I've sent you.  The following two lines deal with the activity I've been involved in since Dec 2, 2001.  Some of my coworkers have said I should leave these lines out.  What do you think?

?	Buy and sale gas for the Enron Estate Team.
?	Provide commercial evaluations on post-petition deals to legal counsel.

Also, I sit right in the middle of the pack so it is a little awkward to talk if everyone is here like they were yesterday.

Thanks

Got it.

Thanks

	So give me the details...............do you know his contract number and I assume the volume will
	be 91080 divided by 27 = 3373/day????  LL

They are starting on the 4th.  I thought I told him the 3rd but I may have made a mistake.  My fault.

Thanks

	Got a call from El Paso asking to begin deal on 4/4???? let me know  what you want to do and

	El Paso's contract that will be picking up gas....

	Thanks Lynda

Let me know if you get this.

thanks

Probably not.  I'll introduce myself to Theresa later this week.

Theresa Vos tells me that she receives invoices directly from the suppliers and also receives an estimate of where the invoices should be from Justin Fernandez.  She says the two have reconciled closely since she's been responsible for payment (she picked this up in the Jan-Feb timeframe), with actuals usually coming in below Justin's estimates.  Accordingly, she has paid the invoiced amounts directly to the supplier without further reconcilliation.

Based on the above, should I be concerned with the "settlements" process?

RH

i cannnot make an upward eye roll, and i can't help if my eyes look beady all the time.

You so funny!  And I've seen men make that upward eye roll as well!    Then there is also the squinty beady eyes when they are mad.

 I don't see the upward eye roll that all women are so good at.  I can even see my daughter practicing it when I feed her.

 
Words Women Use...

FINE ~ This is the word we use at the end of any argument that we feel we
are right about but need to shut you up. NEVER use fine to describe how a
woman looks. This will cause you to have one of those arguments.

FIVE MINUTES ~ This is half an hour. It is equivalent to the five minutes
that your football game is going to last before you take out the trash, so
I
feel that it's an even trade.

NOTHING ~ If you ask her what is wrong and she says NOTHING, this means
something and you should be on your toes. NOTHING is usually used to
describe the feeling a woman has of wanting to turn you inside out, upside
down, and backwards. "Nothing" usually signifies an argument that will last
FIVE MINUTES and end with the word FINE.

GO AHEAD (with raised eyebrows) ~ This is a dare. One that will result in a
woman getting upset over NOTHING and will end with the word FINE.
GO AHEAD (normal eyebrows) ~ This means "I give up" or "do what you want
because I don't care." You will get a raised eyebrow "Go ahead" in just a
few minutes, followed by NOTHING and FINE and she will talk to you in about
FIVE MINUTES when she cools off.

LOUD SIGH ~ This is not actually a word, but is still often a verbal
statement very misunderstood by men. A "Loud Sigh" means she thinks you are
an idiot at that moment and wonders why she is wasting her time standing
here and arguing with you over NOTHING.

SOFT SIGH ~ Again, not a word, but a verbal statement. "Soft Sighs" are one
of the few things that some men actually understand. She is content. Your
best bet is to not move or breathe and she will stay content.

THAT'S OKAY ~ This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can
say to a man. "That's Okay" means that she wants to think long and hard
before paying you retributions for whatever it is that you! have done.
"That's Okay" is often used with the word "Fine" and used in conjunction
with a raised eyebrow "Go ahead." At some point in the near future when she
has plotted and planned, you are going to be in some mighty big trouble.

PLEASE DO ~ This is not a statement, it is an offer. A woman is giving you
the chance to come up with whatever excuse or reason you have for doing
whatever it is that you have done. You have a fair chance to tell the
truth,
so be careful and you shouldn't get a "That's Okay."

THANKS ~ A woman is thanking you. Do not faint; just say "you're welcome."

THANKS A LOT ~ This is much different from "Thanks." A woman will say,
"Thanks A Lot" when she is really ticked off at you. It signifies that you
have hurt her in some callous way, and will be followed by the "Loud Sigh."
Be careful not to ask what is wrong after the "Loud Sigh," as she will only
tell you "Nothing."

Please send this out to ! ALL men that you know just to warn them about
future
arguments they can avoid if remembering all the terminology.

And send to all your women friends to get a good laugh!

I sold 3,253 dth per day of  Florida Zone 3 gas at $3.60 to Bob Crites (713-420-2499) at El Paso effective 4/3/02 - 4/30/02.  I'm leaving this deal out of Sitara because its an Enron Compressor Services deal, not ENA.

Kay, I need to send a GISB agreement as Enron Compressor Services to El Paso.  Would you work on that?

Mark, I'm not sure who at Enron to notify about this deal.  You and I can chat about that later.

I only asked for 2 bids for the April gas.  Reliant showed me a bid of $3.58 and El Paso shoed me a bid of $3.60.

I'm not actively seeking another job and I believe I'll be here to collect that pot of gold next year.  But, I still need a backup for the gas activity.  Unless you tell me to do something different, I'm going to see if Kathy Kelly wants to back me up. 

ENA has an approximate cash balance of $58,000 with Reliant after purchasing the 2,000 dth for tomorrow.  Melissa verifed receipt of the $1.7 million wire made last Thursday.  THANKS MELISSA!!

Let me know if anyone has questions.

  

It looks like Cornerstone Propane, L.P. has not paid their December invoice for physical or financial.  Is there anything going on with them that you guys are aware of?

Neither of these companies have paid us for December 2001 gas.  MidAmerica is probably holding payment for forward value, I don't know about Cornerstone.  Both had invoices sent to them for December sales.  Attached is Cornerstone's SAP balance.  Call me if you need any further information.

 

Priscilla Hamic
<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>

Would you see if we sent out invoices our if someone at Enron requested that no invoices be sent out.

Thanks

Chris

We were not paid by either cornerstone Propane or Midamerican for these deliveries.

Margaret
I had a letter that needed to be sent out today so I left early.  This is what I need and you can tell me what the process is.

ENA purchased gas from TDC (sitara #1143983) in the month of December 2001 on NGPL.  It appears that we scheduled the gas on an NGPL IT agreement to the NGPL LA Pool.  At the pool, it appears that we made some sales 
	Deal 1184526 Cornerstone Propane, L.P.
	Deal 1184587 MidAmerican Energy Company
	Deals 258085 and 315861 to Enron MW, L.L.C.  - desk to desk deals.

Did Cornersone pay ENA for the gas?
Did MidAmerican pay ENA for the gas?
How do these desk to desk deals work?
Did any of this goes go to cash out or did ENA go short and cash out?

Not a rush but I would like to have an answer by next Friday if possible.

Thanks

Please work with Energy Operations to determine where it went and if we sole it or if is still on the pipe.  The priority should be based on your judgment.
Ed

Ed, this gas was nominated on an IT contract into a pool on NGPL.  I am unable to identify the gas after that so its difficult for me to tell if the estate benefited.  Let me know what you want to do at this point.

Thanks

Assuming all of what is below is all correct, it appears that TDC is
entitled to payment.  The question with administrative priority is whether
the the estate benefitted.  If we took the gas, I assume that we did.
THanks.

3/6/02 2:30 PM just spoke with Louis Schott (504-529-3630  Sr. Vice
President & General Counsel for TDC) - TDC has not filed a claim with the
courts at this time.  TDC is trying to avoid the administrative expense and
expects to be paid $203,196.00.  I told him I would call him back Friday
afternoon and give him a status update.  Please let me know what I can tell
him.  This was an ENA deal.

      what additional questions we should ask Dominion.  Thanks.

       - 92860_1.DOC << File: 92860_1.DOC >>

Earlier this week, we reached final resolution with the Creditors' Committee on a comprehensive retention and severance plan for employees of debtor companies, or those parts of Enron in bankruptcy.  Later this morning, we will file the plan with the bankruptcy court.  It will be public and posted on the court's website, but we have posted the plan on <http://home.enron.com>.  (See link below).  Other creditors and interested parties are allowed to review and comment on the plan.  After that, the court may approve or modify it.  We have asked the court to expedite a hearing date to consider the plan and we anticipate a hearing will be scheduled as early as the middle of April.

We want you to know that this plan is the result of much negotiation and compromise between Enron and our Creditors' Committee.  To be viable for approval by the bankruptcy court, a plan has to preserve or generate the greatest value for the estate and its creditors.  This plan meets that criterion.

We know all of you are interested in the plan's details so you can have some degree of financial certainty and make educated decisions for your future.  To help you fully understand how the retention and severance plan will work, we should first explain some near-term restructuring goals.

As we work to secure the most value for our creditors and other stakeholders, restructuring requires us to determine which assets or businesses provide greater value by being sold, as well as which assets or businesses provide greater value by generating ongoing cash flows.  We do have businesses and assets that are capable of emerging from bankruptcy.  We intend to separate those businesses from the liabilities and litigation facing the estate so they can succeed as part of a viable reorganized entity.

This will require us to identify employees best suited to liquidate non-core assets or wind down the estate, as well as employees best suited to support an emerging business.  Given the inherent uncertainty of restructuring, the retention and severance plan offers some measure of financial assurance to all employees of debtor companies regardless of their role within the organization.

The proposed plan is retroactive to March 1, 2002, and has a maximum value up to $130 million depending on the value of asset sales and other cash collections.  It includes the following components:
Severance benefits valued up to $7 million,
Retention payments valued at $40 million, and
Liquidation incentive pool, which is a variable pool tied to the amount of cash collected by the estate, with a minimum value of $7.4 million and a maximum value of up to $90 million, one percent of the estate's cash collection target of $9 billion.

SEVERANCE BENEFITS
A primary component of the proposed retention and severance plan is a new severance program for employees of debtor companies not currently participating in another plan.  Under the proposed plan, employees will be eligible for two weeks base pay for every full or partial year of service, with a maximum of eight weeks base pay and a minimum of $4,500.  If an employee resigns voluntarily or is terminated for cause, he or she is not eligible for severance benefits.

Some non-debtor companies were able to recently institute separate severance plans for their employees.  This was possible because their plans do not require the approval of the bankruptcy court.  The details of those plans have been shared with employees of non-debtor companies.

RETENTION
Under the proposed plan, retention payments will be made to many employees in debtor companies whose skills or knowledge are required indefinitely, or for a predetermined duration of the restructuring.  Regrettably, not all employees will receive retention.

An eligible employee's retention will be a percentage of his or her quarterly base salary.  At the beginning of each quarter, or three-month period, eligible employees will be informed of their projected range of retention compensation for the period by their supervisors.  The actual quarterly payout an employee earns will be decided at the end of the quarter based on performance and achievements during the period.

An employee participating in the retention program will receive 25 percent of the earned quarterly retention at the end of each period, with payouts as soon as practical after May 31, August 31, November 30, 2002, and February 28, 2003.  The remaining 75 percent of the earned retention for a period is non-vested, deferred, and will be paid to an employee after February 28, 2003.

If involuntarily terminated without cause prior to February 28, 2003, an employee will receive all deferred retention, plus retention based on the actual earned salary for the quarter in which he or she is terminated.  Employees' earned and deferred retention payments are considered post-petition administrative claims that take precedent over other obligations owed by the estate.

An employee involuntarily terminated without cause is eligible for the greater of severance benefits or earned retention, with the total amount of retention payments received offsetting the amount of severance received.  Depending on an employee's personal circumstances, a participant in the retention program may wish to consider setting aside some portion of retention as a financial safety net in the event he or she is involuntarily terminated.

If an employee receiving retention voluntarily resigns prior to February 28, 2003, or is terminated for cause, he or she does not earn a retention payment for that quarter and forfeits all deferred retention.  He or she would not be eligible for severance.

Any amounts not paid out are returned to the retention fund and could be reallocated to current or new participants of the program.

LIQUIDATION INCENTIVE POOL
Under the proposed plan, employees identified as critical to the sale of non-core assets and businesses will be eligible to participate in the liquidation incentive pool (LIP).  The amount of money in the pool will be directly tied to the amount of cash collected by the estate.

Enron's management committee will have discretion to assign incentive payments to participants in the liquidation pool after each $500 million dollars is collected, also called a "collection milestone".  Fifty percent of an employee's earned liquidation incentive for a collection period will be distributed at the time a milestone is reached.  The remaining 50 percent of the earned liquidation incentive is non-vested and deferred.

If a collection milestone is not reached in a given quarter, but progress has been made, a quarterly advance may be allocated among participants of the program based on a quarterly floor amount of $1.85 million.  Fifty percent of an employee's quarterly advance will be paid as soon as practical after May 31, August 31, November 30, 2002, and February 28, 2003.  The remaining 50 percent of an earned advance will be non-vested and deferred, and will offset against future incentive payments.

All accrued and deferred liquidation will be paid at the earlier of the following events:
1.		Enron's reorganization is complete; or
2.	the employee is involuntarily terminated without cause, or
3.	upon specified dates related to incremental cash collections.

Employees' earned and deferred liquidation incentives are considered post-petition administrative claims that take precedent over other obligations owed by the estate.

Employees participating in the liquidation incentive pool are not eligible for severance benefits.  If an employee receiving liquidation incentives voluntarily resigns prior to February 28, 2003, or is terminated for cause, he or she will forfeit any deferred liquidation incentive payment and any minimum liquidation payment for the quarter in which he or she resigns.

Any amounts not paid out are returned to the liquidation incentive pool and could be reallocated to current or new participants of the program.

OTHER ITEMS
Bankruptcy law allows creditors to claim as fraudulent any significant payments made by a company in the 90-day period prior to its bankruptcy's filing.  To that end, creditors may attempt to reclaim retention payments made prior to Enron's bankruptcy filing that they perceive were inappropriate or have not returned adequate value to the estate.  The Creditors' Committee has agreed to forego its right to pursue claims against any current employee who agrees to release claims against the company, and stays with the company through August 31, 2002, or until he or she is involuntarily terminated without cause, whichever comes first.

All debtor company employees will be required to sign a general release to receive their final severance benefits, deferred quarterly retention payments, or deferred liquidation payments.

We know how long you have waited for details about this plan.  We will instruct supervisors to begin communicating projected participation to each individual employee next week.  Although the Creditors' Committee has approved it, this proposed plan is not final until approved by the bankruptcy court.  Therefore, it is possible an employee's status could change depending on the final plan approved by the court.  Supervisors will hold follow up meetings with each employee to confirm his or her individual participation after the bankruptcy court rules on the plan.

 I don't see the upward eye roll that all women are so good at.  I can even see my daughter practicing it when I feed her.

 
Words Women Use...

FINE ~ This is the word we use at the end of any argument that we feel we
are right about but need to shut you up. NEVER use fine to describe how a
woman looks. This will cause you to have one of those arguments.

FIVE MINUTES ~ This is half an hour. It is equivalent to the five minutes
that your football game is going to last before you take out the trash, so
I
feel that it's an even trade.

NOTHING ~ If you ask her what is wrong and she says NOTHING, this means
something and you should be on your toes. NOTHING is usually used to
describe the feeling a woman has of wanting to turn you inside out, upside
down, and backwards. "Nothing" usually signifies an argument that will last
FIVE MINUTES and end with the word FINE.

GO AHEAD (with raised eyebrows) ~ This is a dare. One that will result in a
woman getting upset over NOTHING and will end with the word FINE.
GO AHEAD (normal eyebrows) ~ This means "I give up" or "do what you want
because I don't care." You will get a raised eyebrow "Go ahead" in just a
few minutes, followed by NOTHING and FINE and she will talk to you in about
FIVE MINUTES when she cools off.

LOUD SIGH ~ This is not actually a word, but is still often a verbal
statement very misunderstood by men. A "Loud Sigh" means she thinks you are
an idiot at that moment and wonders why she is wasting her time standing
here and arguing with you over NOTHING.

SOFT SIGH ~ Again, not a word, but a verbal statement. "Soft Sighs" are one
of the few things that some men actually understand. She is content. Your
best bet is to not move or breathe and she will stay content.

THAT'S OKAY ~ This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can
say to a man. "That's Okay" means that she wants to think long and hard
before paying you retributions for whatever it is that you! have done.
"That's Okay" is often used with the word "Fine" and used in conjunction
with a raised eyebrow "Go ahead." At some point in the near future when she
has plotted and planned, you are going to be in some mighty big trouble.

PLEASE DO ~ This is not a statement, it is an offer. A woman is giving you
the chance to come up with whatever excuse or reason you have for doing
whatever it is that you have done. You have a fair chance to tell the
truth,
so be careful and you shouldn't get a "That's Okay."

THANKS ~ A woman is thanking you. Do not faint; just say "you're welcome."

THANKS A LOT ~ This is much different from "Thanks." A woman will say,
"Thanks A Lot" when she is really ticked off at you. It signifies that you
have hurt her in some callous way, and will be followed by the "Loud Sigh."
Be careful not to ask what is wrong after the "Loud Sigh," as she will only
tell you "Nothing."

Please send this out to ! ALL men that you know just to warn them about
future
arguments they can avoid if remembering all the terminology.

And send to all your women friends to get a good laugh!

I can do it but I need to see the invoices in questions.

Lee Ann, should we be updating Sitara with this info or do we just need to tell you?

Scott, I know last month Kim Olinger was running Sitara reports for ?flash? maybe and trying to correct a few things.  I'm not sure what the process is now.  Should we continue updating Sitara for transport items?

By the way team, Scott is out till next week.

Guys,

Can you help me respond to Volume Management?  I do not know what really is involve in getting the $'s in the right bucket.

Thanks,
Ruth

Ruth,

FYI the payment of $1,312.50 from Transwestern came in to ENA on 3/4/02.  Do you have a particular way you'd like these dollars handled?

- Lee Ann

Rita,

Richard Hanagriff at Transwestern called and asked that we e-mail him our wiring instructions so that TW can pay ENA's capacity release revenue sharing for January 2002.  The details of the deal and my discussions with TW are given below.  Please send him the wiring instructions so that we can get the money in the door.

Please note that there will also be payments made to ENA under K#24924 for February and March 2002.  The good news is that invoice credits will be very clear for Feruary and March, since the deals were done for the entire month.

Richard Hanagriff's phone number is 713-853-6709.

Thanks,

Ruth

CAPACITY RELEASE REVENUE SHARING TRANSACTION

ENA and Transwestern agreed to share the revenues generated in releasing ENA's TW capacity in excess of our discounted rates on a month-to-month basis.  The agreement also requires that TW release us from claims if the capacity is released at rates below ENA's contract rates.  As a result, only K# 24924 (i.e. the San Juan contract) has been released to a third party.

Transwestern was able to release the 25,000 Dth/d of Ignacio to I/B Link capacity at $0.065/Dth for January 11-31 (i.e. 21 days).  Since our discounted rate is $0.06/Dth, ENA should receive 50% of $0.005/Dth, or $0.0025/Dth, for the 21 day period.  Transwestern's invoice for January 2002 business showed that a $13,687.50 payment is due Transwestern.  This amount was calculated from a credit of $0.0625/Dth for 21 days offsetting the $46,500 monthly charge.  Another way to calculate this amount is that ENA's portion of the capacity release revenue sharing, $1,312.50, was netted against the  $15,000.00 pipeline charges for January 1-10.

ENA's position is that the agreement entitled ENA to receive the revenue sharing of $1,312.50 as a cash payment during the normal billing cycle, and that the other $15,000 should be addressed during the bankruptcy claim process.  I discussed this issue with Paul Y'Barbo at Transwestern on February 15th.  He followed up with me on February 20th that ENA will be paid the $1,312.50 as soon as Transwestern receives payment from the outside party that picked up ENA's capacity.  TW thought that payment from the third party would be received in a "couple of days".

  

FYI

Have already communicated this to Doug Sewell as well....

Thanks.  You too!!

Thanks!  Have a Happy Easter!

Today, I revised the $70,000.00 wire to $989,700.00.

This money gets applied to the following April deals on Florida;
			April 1st	10,000 dth x 1 day x $3.27 =
$32,700.00
			April 2nd-30th	10,000 dth x 29 days x $3.30 =
$957,000.00
					Total Prepayment
$989,700.00

I'm not sure if anyone is using the attached worksheet but I've included
the baseload wire and purchase information on the summary tab.

 <<ENA-Reliant Prepay.xls>>

>  -----Original Message-----

Here's what I've got, but it doesn't include Pipeline Reps.

 

These are all the people I have been working with lately.

 

I want to cancel the wire to Dominion Oklahoma that was set to go out today and I'm going to revise the $70,000.00 wire to Reliant.

The other wires to Reliant, the $701,760.00 and the $40,000.00, are good to go.

I will have this completed before lunch but I estimate that the $70,000.00 wire to Reliant will be revised to approximatly $995,000.00.
This net impact is an increase in cash outflows of $280,000.00 (cancel the $646,860 and increase the $70,0000to $995,000).

I am requesting the following prepays to Reliant and Dominion for tomorrow.  All of these request are signed and on Doug's desk.

Prepay to Reliant for April Trunkline deal (sitara #1202698)   6,800 dth x 30 days x $3.44 per dth = $701,760.00

Prepay to Reliant for swing supply on Florida and Trunkline  $40,000.00

Prepay to Reliant for intraday backup supply in case Dominion does not perform under the contract
		10,000 dth x 2 days x $3.50 per dth = $70,000.00

Prepay to Dominion Oklahoma for April baseload activity 10,000 dth x 30 days x $2.1562 per dth = $646,860.00

i agree with kay's suggested approach.

if we are purchasing gas from another source at a higher price, i would put
dominion on notice that we are doing that and stating we will hold them
responsible.

I've left a message for Dominion's counsel, telling him that we disagree
with their position that they can terminate the gas contract, and asking
him to educate us as to why they don't think that action is stayed.

We can follow up with a letter suggesting that we believe their termination
is wrongful, unless Mark disagrees.

Second issue is whether we should attempt to pay for the gas anyway, since
they have to deliver gas paid for prior to termination.

Dominion's lawyer left me a message that they are sticking with the termination.  I will send them a letter telling them that we will be covering.

Mark Ellenberg is off for Passover.  We can discuss options early next week.  I have beed in contact with him, and he is familiar with the issues.

The contract is a bit complicated.  I will prepare a contract summary along the lines of what Pete prepared for MCV.

Hi team.  Here is my new cell phone number, 832-867-3346.  I just changed it in People Finder so it may not show up until tomorrow.

Should I cancel the wire that is scheduled to go out today?  It might be too late but I can check.

I wonder if HR changed this holiday schedule over the last couple of months?  Let's ask Kathy, she will know.

 

I asked Kay Mann about that and she said that if we want the gas for April then we should continue with "business as normal" which means we pay for the whole month since that is what we've been doing.  She felt that paying for the whole month was better than paying for just 5 days worth of gas.
 
Ed, I gave this info to Doug before he went to the cash meeting.  This was just in case you had the same question.

Hey guys,
Don wants to know why we have to pay Dominion for the full month.  Is it a contractual obligation?  Can we just pay them for a week or two?
 
Please let me know ASAP.
 
Thanks,
ds

Looks good to me.  First word of second para - Ever or Even?

Prepay to Reliant for swing supply on Florida and Trunkline  $40,000.00

Prepay to Reliant for intraday backup supply in case Dominion does not perform under the contract
		10,000 dth x 2 days x $3.50 per dth = $70,000.00

   

Will do.  Thanks for the info.

Hi Chris,

My name is Joan Morgan and I do the capacity release here at Keyspan
(Boston Gas).  Next month and thereafter when you do the assignment of
the Iroquois contract (volume 35,465 dth), instead of using Liz Danehy
as the bidder contact, will you use my name?  The telephone number and
fax will remain the same.  My e-mail address is
jmorgan@keyspanenergy.com.

Thanks.  Let me know if you have any questions concerning this.

Joan Morgan

You are my hero.  I am going to have a 2 day backup plan just in case Dominion doesn't deliver any gas.  

Ill do the best I can.

Done with these.  Is there another list?  I can't remember.

Max, I forgot all about you needing this.  I'm working on it now and I'll highlight the items as I do it in case it takes a couple of days.
This is what I have done so far.
Chris,
Just following up on this item as I have tried to process these adjustments and
they have not been zeroed in Sitara yet.  If I need to send these to someone
else, just let me know.

Thanks,
Max

Chris,

Here are the adjustments that need to be made in Sitara for November 2001

I had Phillip Love enter these prior to the bankruptcy.  These are items we would have collected and then
repaid to other parties on behalf of the State of Florida.  Since we were unable to do that, these charges need
to be removed.  If you have any other questions, please call me.

Thanks,
Max

P.S.  I will be sending your pricing adjustments for December 2001 soon.

Louis Dicarlo said you should chat with Sara Shackleton about the Dominion ISDA agreement.  BUT you may already be doing that.

The contract number assigned to this deal in Sitara is 96003121.
The contract number in Sitara for the Tallahassee deal is 96003663.

Dominion Oklahoma Texas Exploration & Production, Inc (successor to Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp) is supplying ENA 10,000 dth per day at a Florida Zone 1.  This supply is matched up with ENA's sale to The City of Tallahassee.  I believe both deals go through March 2013.  I prepay Dominion for the supply each month.

This morning, I had a voicemail from my contact at Dominion, David Walker (405-749-5240).  His voicemail stated that Dominion was terminating their contract with ENA and Dominion would not be supplying any gas effective April 1, 2002.  Paul Vrana (713-752-4514) with Jackson Walker is representing Dominion, he prepared the termination letter.  

Just spoke with Paul (10:55 AM) - he has not spoken with anyone representing Enron but he has worked with Harlam Murphy?? in the past.  He will fax a letter to me.

Kay, I will leave a copy of the letter in your chair.

  In the past someone at Bridgeline would call someone at ENA or vice versa to approve the deal ticket so that the deal terms would populate the accounting system.  Note: this would only happen with Brigdeline because it is and Enron affiliate and because we are using the same trading systems.

Approving this ticket will give Bridgeline the ability to bill ENA.  I think there might be another way to do this without someone at ENA approving a ticket.  I'll see what I can do.

Nothing is paid to or agreed with Bridgeline until we reach resolution and get approval to proceed.  Have we received these in past months?  What have we done with those?

If it does not create a confirmation, what does it mean to approve this ticket?

ENA and Bridgeline use the same trading/accounting system, Sitara and Unify.  In the good ol' days, the traders would enter the deals in Sitara (which includes volume and pricing terms).  Accounting would use Unify to track the volumes and bill and pay our counter parties.  Unify gets the pricing information from Sitara.

Would this have any impact on our Bridgeline negotiations or our legal rights if I approve this ticket?  According to Cyndie in Global Contracts, this will not create a confirmation.

I still don't have access to West (deal 1198936).  I'm almost positive I entered this deal and I thought I entered it as a Central Desk deal.  When I book my deals on Trunkline for April, should I use Central?  We will be serving the Midland Cogeneration deal #340362 for April.

I also didn't request access for ENA Upstream but Kathy Kelly should be able to take care of that.

Do you have all access that you need now?  Let me know.

I will be increasing my prepays to Reliant this week to cover any swing activity on the MCV Trunkline deal.  I have changed the "est cash flow" tab in the Tallahassee Swing Cash Flow file.

rafael is a guy.  

Hey, do you mind if I send her an email with all the stuff attached?

You are my hero.

Hi, Scott!

Thanks for thinking of me.  Lia already called me and I contacted the guy at
Shell.  They're looking for someone to do refined products marketing and
transportation.  I'm not experienced in that and frankly not very interested
in starting something completely new in the energy business.  I'm too old!!

Hope things are going well at UBS.  Say hi to everyone for me.  I sent Andy
an email several weeks ago but haven't heard back.  I know you guys are busy
trying to get everything set up.  Good luck!

Take care,

Susan
Susan,
Lia Halstead called me to say Rafeal.pina@shell.com is looking for traders.
She didn't know his number and my contact at Coral didn't find him in their
database.
My contact said it might be Equiva even with a shell address.
Not much of a lead, but hope it can help.

You are a very sensitive person and you try hard (perhaps a little too hard) to make favourable impressions and to be recognised by your peers. But you have that inherent need to feel appreciated and admired and you are easily hurt if all of your endeavours go by unappreciated or not acknowledged. Stop trying so hard.
You are very talented, imaginative and sensitive but you are holding back as you do not really like going it 'on your own'. In preference you would like to team up with someone, someone with similar attributes as your own, to explore - to seek out and go perhaps 'where no other man has trod before'. It is the unusual that attracts you and which will give you a sense of excitement and adventure.
Everything seems to have gone wrong and the situation at this time is such that you are not quite sure which way to turn. So it would appear that you are 'holding back', re-consolidating your position and relinquishing all fun and games for the time being.
You are holding back. You need to find friends in whom you can trust and once they have proved themselves beyond all possible doubt you will be prepared to give them your all. The existing situation is not of your liking - you have an unsatisfied need for mental stimulation with others whose standards are as high as your own. Trying to control your instincts the way you do restricts your ability to open up to others and the way you feel at this time is suggestive of 'total surrender'. This is not to your liking as you consider such thoughts as weaknesses that need to be overcome. You feel that only by control, controlling your innermost thoughts, are you able to maintain your air of superiority. You want to be admired for yourself alone and not for what you can do or for what you may have done. In essence 'you need to be needed' and at the same time 'you need to need'.
You need to be respected as an exceptional individual. This is the only way that you can hope to achieve the status that you wish to achieve. You set yourself very high standards - and come what may - you abide by them.
Don't date or hook yourself up with a hussy.  Just remember, no woman deserves you and they should all thank their lucky stars that you even ackknowledge them.

According to Kay Mann, Shemin may not be here until late afternoon.

With a heavy hand I write this message to the Aquila Merchant Services people.  As Bob mentioned in his earlier message we must now reduce our Wholesale Group to reflect that we, ILA, do not have the credit capacity to continue to support the needs of the business.  Starting today we will begin to wind down our Commodity Services and CapitalServices groups, both in North America and in Europe, with the goal of being significantly out of all commercial operations by the end of the summer.  Later today we will take the first step to reduce the headcount of the organization.  For many of our fellow workers today will be the last day at Aquila.  For those not released today, we will need to, as carefully and responsibly as possible, put our beloved company to bed.  At the end of this process, the remaining employees, as is true with me, will be let go. 

No one is to blame, it is just an unfortunate reality we have found ourselves in, and we are left with this ugly choice.  Please try to hold your head up, we have built a great company of talented, motivated, creative, and dedicated people.   Hold on to your integrity, respect yourself and each other, and remember what a team we have had.

Prepayment and gas flow activity through Monday March 26th.

I have added 2 new members to the team, welcome Melissa and Sheeley.  Feel free to hit Jim Taylor up for a free lunch.

 

I just deleted something you emailed me on March 20th or 21st.  I think it might have been related to Columbia gas but I'm not sure.

Prepay for Dominion for April 2002 to be made on Friday, March 29th.  I printed out the attached form and gave it to Doug Sewell.

Prepay amount = 10,000 dth per day x 30 days x $2.1562 = $646,860.00

 

The CIA had an opening for an assassin. After all of the background checks, interviews, and testing were done there were three finalists...2 men and a woman.

For the final test, the CIA agents took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a gun. "We must know that you will follow your instructions, no matter what the circumstances. Inside of this room, you will find your wife sitting in a chair. Kill her!!!" The man said, "You can't be serious. I could never shoot my wife." The agent said, "Then you are not the right man for this job."

The second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went into the room. All was quiet for about 5 minutes. Then the man came out with tears in his eyes. "I tried, but I can't kill my wife." The agent said, "You don't have what it takes. Take your wife and go home."

Finally, it was the woman's turn. She was given the same instructions, to kill her husband. She took the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, one shot after another. They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. After a few minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the woman. She wiped the sweat from her brow and said, "This gun was loaded with blanks. I had to beat him to death with the chair."

Moral: Women are evil. Don't mess with them.

Ruth, use this as a starting point for the payment to Tennessee.  Make sure you copy Magaret Dhont and Rita Wynne on this.

Another prepay to Tennessee.  The calculation for the prepay is 2,000 dth x $.1221 per dth = $244.20. 

 

I will be available by 9:05 AM.  I have to buy gas around 9 am every morning.

Chris,  
I  propose we meet/talk with Kathryn before noon tomorrow. Will you be able to do  to that?

Also, only one  company listed above could provide daily actuals so the others are just  being split by 31 days.    I figured if the producer disputed  his split (if paid), he could provide the back-up to make it more  accurate.  
 
Any comments  will be helpful.  Thanks.    
 
 

 

We (EES) have been getting December production payments ready -- what are your thoughts on actually paying the post-petition pieces?   Besides Dominion, we have producers off of Gatherco, Columbia Natural Resources,  Columbia Gas Transmission, Peoples Natural Gas, and East Ohio Gas.    Are these on your list to review some day like you are doing Dominion?     A few producers have called wanting to know when to expect payment and I just need to know whether to forge ahead to get caught up in getting their payments in the system, or to wait in case we have the producers taken out of our pools on all these pipes/ldc's.   It is a ton of work, and if it doesn't need to happen, all the better, but if it does need to happen, I need to be working on it now.

I am releasing the Boston Gas capacity on Iroquois (k#125008) and Tennessee (k#29667) for April to Boston Gas.  I am releasing the capacity prearranged, subject to bid, minimum bid of 100% of max rate with Boston Gas as the prearranged bidder.  Bidding will end on Monday, March 25th.

Submitted Iroq offer #50169 on 3/21/02
Submitted Tenn offer #29667-6 on 3/21/02

With a heavy hand I write this message to the Aquila Merchant Services people.  As Bob mentioned in his earlier message we must now reduce our Wholesale Group to reflect that we, ILA, do not have the credit capacity to continue to support the needs of the business.  Starting today we will begin to wind down our Commodity Services and CapitalServices groups, both in North America and in Europe, with the goal of being significantly out of all commercial operations by the end of the summer.  Later today we will take the first step to reduce the headcount of the organization.  For many of our fellow workers today will be the last day at Aquila.  For those not released today, we will need to, as carefully and responsibly as possible, put our beloved company to bed.  At the end of this process, the remaining employees, as is true with me, will be let go. 

No one is to blame, it is just an unfortunate reality we have found ourselves in, and we are left with this ugly choice.  Please try to hold your head up, we have built a great company of talented, motivated, creative, and dedicated people.   Hold on to your integrity, respect yourself and each other, and remember what a team we have had.  

Ed

I think you will be happy with me.  I believe I was able to release the capacity for April under offer #50169.

Chris:

I'll write up an IOL trouble ticket at our end and I will have our IT guy to
call you and help you with the access.

And I have another question:  who at Enron should be receiving invoices?  Could
you please tell me.  It used to go to Ryan Keith.  Is he still there?  If not,
who should the person be?  Please let me know.  Thanks.

thx, looks like its working.  it probably already worked.  i just forgot to use the icon you set up for me.  i'll send you another nasty email next month.

Chris, i replaced your Iroquios icon with an iolssn1024-DAN.ica ... try it and let me know if this one works.

Jimmy

According to Iroq the problem is on our side.  Please call me first think Monday morning at 3-4743.  Following is the address that I'm starting at.  I go to this address and click on "Customer Activities" and that's when I get the error message.  It should ask me for my ID and password.

We've chatted before but you may not remember me.  I'm currently working for the ENA Estate team and I need to purchase some Trunkline Ela gas for April.  Ruth Concannon suggested that I contact you but she didn't have your number handy.  I also have other buy/sells that come up from time to time as well.  Please let me know if you would be interested in selling us gas.

Thanks to each of you who agreed to sponsor my MS150 bike ride.  Can you please complete the following spreadsheet and return it to me?

 << File: MS150 Pledge Sheet.xls >> 

Just a few things you should be aware of:

1.  I prefer checks written to "National MS Society"  

2.  Please send checks to me (via post or interoffice mail) at: 
     work - 1400 Smith Street, ECS 04443, Houston, TX, 77002 or
     home - 3400 Timmons Lane #66, Houston, TX, 77027
     Or call me at 35966 and we can arrange something.

3.  The purpose of completing the pledge sheet is so that MS can send each of you a receipt for your records.

My riding continues....the wet roads made for an interesting ride on Sunday!!  Again, I thank each of you for your contribution.

I don't use the start menu to access my pipeline EBB which is what I think this is.  But I do go to this website on the internet
	==>    http://escript.dom.com/

to access the Dominion EBB.  Dominion used to be called CNG.

My name is Bryan DeLuca, and I am with the Application Integration Team.  We are doing a routine maintenance and are wondering if you are still using the Energy Scheduling Weblinks CNG program? You will find this program under the start menu \ programs \ Business Applications.

Please reply back to this email letting us now if you ARE, or ARE NOT using the Energy Scheduling Weblinks Cng program anymore. If you are not using this program anymore it will be removed.

Thank you for your time,
Bryan A. DeLuca

I have confirm letters on my desk.  Should I send those to you?

Okay, Chris - - - - to confirm or not to confirm????

Stacy, does anyone in legal want to be included on this in the future (especially since you are Scotland bound)? Or should we just coordinate this with Chris?

Thank you!
Cyndie

Ann, 
Please coordinate with Chris Germany on these.  He is very involved in these deals and should be consulted about the paperwork.

Thanks, 

Stacy

Hi Stacy,

Attached is a list of post-12/3 deals pending confirmatiopn for your review.  Please send notice as to approval for each to be released to the counterparty.

Thanks,

Ann

 << File: DCAFF deals 3-18-2002.xls >> 

I have an event that I need to attend tomorrow afternoon so I will be taking the half a day off starting at lunchtime.  I will send out a plan of action for Trunkline this afternoon.

IF anyone needs me you can page me at 877-498-5497 BUT do not leave a voicemail, I don't know how to retrieve them.

Sure.  I have one gas purchase that I make right before 9:00 AM every morning but I can be there at 9:05 AM or later.

Just to give all some background.

We would like to understand the business plan for ENA, so that we can plan staffing, etc.  For example, in Retail, the business plan is to sale the books of business by May 31.  That allows us to make plans for each functional area to determine staffing gaps, etc.

We are looking for the same on Wholesale.

Chris - Can you help us with that?  If not, we will need to reschedule the meeting.

Let me know.

Brenda

ENA and Bridgeline use the same trading/accounting system, Sitara and Unify.  In the good ol' days, the traders would enter the deals in Sitara (which includes volume and pricing terms).  Accounting would use Unify to track the volumes and bill and pay our counter parties.  Unify gets the pricing information from Sitara.

Would this have any impact on our Bridgeline negotiations or our legal rights if I approve this ticket?  According to Cyndie in Global Contracts, this will not create a confirmation.

Just Wade and I chatting with Shemin.  We tried calling Dominion's Bankruptcy counsel, outside counsel (which is seperate), and in house counsel and couldn't get anyone.  I believe Shemin has a much better idea though.  BUT, I think its important to note that those producer agreements are Enfolio contracts.

did anything get settled, or was it just an info sharing session??????

Shemin, just give me a call when you are ready.  I'll let Wade know and we will come to your office.

Wade,
I am meeting K. Higgason for lunch at 12:30, so can we please meet at
1:30, or 1:45?

I, of course MUST have my lunch hour.  But after that is over, say 1:00
or so, lets get together.  Shemin, you set the time.  Wade, bring some
of those letters you are talking about down below.

Kathryn, we are going to discuss what you and I talked about yesterday.
Can we just go back to ??Dec 2nd?? and terminate the pools without
Dominion billing Enron all these extra charges.  You and Patricia can
decide if you want to come.

Thanks

I never know what contract the deal is under but I can confirm the price and the volumes for the following;

Deal	 	Counterparty					Comment
1192958	Sequent Energy Management, LP 		approved
1198866	Anadarko Energy Services Company		approved
1195770	MidAmerican Energy Company			approved
1195777	MidAmerican Energy Company			Changed price from $2.05 to $2.02 in Sitara per notes from Sylvia Pollan.
1195767	MidAmerican Energy Company			approved
1192959	City of Tallahassee				this should be on deal #30534 - part of the long term contract.

I don't have access to view the other deals but I'm working on it.  I believe I entered the other 2 Anadarko deals in Sitara but either I put them on the wrong desk or they were moved after I entered them because I don't have access to them either. GRRRR.

Scott, Margaret, I changed the price on deal 1195777 (Feb 2002 activity) from $2.05 to $2.02.  We prepaid MidAmerican $1,158,864.00 for all 3 deals shown above.  Not sure who to tell about Sitara changes.

You may or may not be able to do anything about this but I've requested access to several different desk in Sitara and the people that approve these items all work for UBS.  Now I'm trying to pull up a deal that was on the central desk ( I thought) and its showing up as a west desk ticket and I can't access it.  I thought I was the one that entered it in Sitara.  Sitara deal #1198936 is an example.

Can you help get me access?

I did submit a request via "e Request" - #83213.  I didn't know if you wanted to assign other people to do this and I don't know HOW you would do that either.  I just asked for everything to cover all the bases.

You don't need UBS approval for access to estate files.

Did you submit a request for access.  I will approve.

You can not have access to AEP info however.

thanks

bob

I hope I have the right Bob Hall.  I'm trying to get sitara access to the West and Texas Desk and they have not been approved yet.  I'm waiting for Phillip Love (now with UBS) to approve the West and O'Neal Winfree (not sure who this is) to approve the Texas Desk.

Tommy Yanowski was able to help with a couple of these but it looks like we need to get the approving parties changed.

I also left a message for the help desk about this.

	You were not given access to AEP.

It's the first day of school in Houston and the teacher thought she'd
get  to know the kids by asking them their name and what their father does
for a  living.

The first little girl says: "My name is Mary and my daddy is a postman."

The next little boy says: "I'm Andy and my Dad is a mechanic."

Then one little boy says: "My name is Jimmy and my father is a striptease
dancer in a cabaret for gay men."

The teacher gasps and quickly changes the subject, but later in the
school yard the teacher approaches Jimmy privately and asks if it was really
true that his Dad dances nude in a gay bar  He blushed and said,
"I'm sorry but my dad is an 
 
	1) auditor for Arthur Andersen

	OR

	2) a trader for Enron

 and I was just too embarrassed to say so."

actually, could you or Kathryn send Shemin 5 Dominion producer contracts.  Just any 5 will do.  She just wants to get a feel for what these contracts look like.

Chris, I have just opened up my messages and see I have missed this meeting?  Do you need something from me?  SORRY! Patricia

Shemin, just give me a call when you are ready.  I'll let Wade know and we will come to your office.

Another interesting item.  Call me when you get a chance.

I am in receipt of several faxes from Dominion Transmission Inc which inform Enron of DTI's intention of not crediting gas from listed meters/producers to Enron's pool.  Per Dan Baney of DTI, the listed effective dates are dates as of which gas will not be credited.  In some cases, they are taking back gas previously allocated to the pool. 

While DTI is asking for a signoff from Enron agreeing to these statements, we have not sent any back.  I have forwarded all of these to you for handling along with the many other issues between Enron, DTI, and the affected producers.

My Tenn emails from way back.

Same thing as yesterday.  I requested a wire in the amount of 244.20 (2000 dth x $.1221 per dth) which is for gas flow on ENA's IT contract #2891 on 2/6/02.  I negotiated this deal with Michelle in the bid room.  You should have received this yesterday afternoon.

Thanks
chris

Ted, thanks for your help on the account number.  I have requested a wire in the amount of $244.20 (2000 dth x $.1221 per dth) which is for gas flow on ENA's IT contract #2891 on 2/5/02.  This is a negotiated IT deal that I did with Bob Fleming in the Bid Room.

Please call me at 713-853-4743 if you have any questions.

I have requested a wire to Reliant for Thursday in the amount of $30,000.00.

I have a bill from Cingular Wireless in my iPayit account.  I called Cingular and asked them when this bill was last paid.  They said before Dec 2nd.  I told them they should cancel the service.  Don't know if they are going to do that or not.

8:25 am Per Lisa at Cingular WIreless, this account has been cancelled.

Elizabeth Hernandez is currently working as a contract employee for Sherry Thomas.  Elizabeth told me her contract runs out at the end of this month.  Kathy and I both loved working with her and think she would be a good employee to keep on the gas side if you have any spots available.  Her last spot on the gas side was in deal validation.

This has not been a good informative day.  We just need to chat with Dominion to figure out how the contracts work and for me to find out more info the storage contracts.

Max, I forgot all about you needing this.  I'm working on it now and I'll highlight the items as I do it in case it takes a couple of days.
This is what I have done so far.
Chris,
Just following up on this item as I have tried to process these adjustments and
they have not been zeroed in Sitara yet.  If I need to send these to someone
else, just let me know.

I had Phillip Love enter these prior to the bankruptcy.  These are items we would have collected and then
repaid to other parties on behalf of the State of Florida.  Since we were unable to do that, these charges need
to be removed.  If you have any other questions, please call me.

Thanks,
Max

P.S.  I will be sending your pricing adjustments for December 2001 soon.

Attached below you will find the master file that I use to keep on ENA Upstream contracts.  In one of the columns on the left you will find my ID's and passwords to the various bulletin boards.  Other than Tennesse, I'm not sure how many of these are still active.

Let me know if you need any help regarding ENA Upstream questions.

 

Where are you located?  I'll come by to get them after I go to the credit union.

I have copies of the Dominion (CNGP) for EES for 11/01, 12/01, 1/02. I have not received any statements for 2/01. The stack is too much to fax.  Would you like for me to send them interoffice?

Thanks

I'm still waiting to hear from EES - no word at all.

Bryant Baker at Bridgeline is asking me to approve this deal so Bridgeline can bill ENA for the storage service.  Normally I wouldn't worry about it but since we are in negotiations with Bridgeline I'm not sure what to do.

Is a confirm generated if I approve this ticket?

Also, when does this deal terminate in the global contracts system?

Silly me.  I goofed, I had the wrong beginning balance in my worksheet.  Currently looking at sending out $30,000 on Thursday.

I'm estimating a $50,000 prepay to Reliant this Thursday.  Cash is up $.20 from Friday.  I may need to make the prepay on Wed again.  I'll have a better idea after 9:00 AM tomorrow.

Sounds good.  I believe Alain is out till Thur and I hope we meet before then.

I suggest adding Alain Diza (EES scheduler) or Patricia Downey (EES VM) instead of/along with myself as they actually know something about Dominion.    :)

Hey there team.  We are starting to focus on Dominion pipeline and I need your help explaining the process to Shemin.  I would like to set up a meeting with Gloria, Wade, Shemin, Kathryn as soon as possible.

You're right Chris; Dominion is charging .0721 for parking.

We are having dinner with Suzanne this Thur if that's ok with you.  I think you and I should register at the hospital tonight or tomorrow night if possible.

Excellent notes.  Thanks

Chris,

I am faxing copies of Jan. 2002 and Feb. 2002 Sonat invoices to Maria.  I do see the balances on #1 and #2 on the Jan. 2002 statements.  It looks like we received 77,292 mmbtus back on contract PSNG2194 leaving a balance of 188,949 on deal #1222.  There was no activity for Jan. 2002 on contract PAL1001,deal 1424.  We were charged a total of $19,043.73 for the remaining volumes in storage ($.00305 per day).  Please let me know if there is anything else that I need to do.  

Thanks,

Rita x37694

Still not sure about the actual volumes for items 1 and 3 below but we did confirm that Sonat did not pay us for the volumes delivered in Jan 2002.

Mark, I assume you are the person Sonat will be contacting.  Here are some items to consider,

	1.  Park balance on deal #1222  188,949 dth ( + or - 10,000 dth)
	2.  Loan balance on deal #1424  (96,000) dth
	3.  ENA sold Sonat 496,000 dth at $2.885 for Jan 2002 and did not deliver 418,708 dth (+ or - 10,000 dth, related to Item #1)
	4.  ENA sold Sonat 310,000 dth at $2.955 for May 2002, I don't know if this deal has been terminated or not.

Rita, Maria and I are looking for the Sonat pipeline statements for Jan 2002.  We have Dec 2001.  Would you see if you have those and let one of us know please?  Sonat may have stopped sending us statements, but this would answer my volume questions on items 1 and 3.

Margaret, could you see if Sonat paid us for 77,292 dth x $2.885 = $222,987.42 for the sale in Jan 2002?  I would be very surprised if they did.

Barbara Gilbert, my scheduling rep. at Sonat, informed me that the attorneys in Sonat's Houston office will be contacting Enron's attorneys to set up a meeting to address the PAL issue.   .

9:50 AM Per Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent.  Tammi spoke to Lisa Guthrie (205-325-3816) at Sonat to find out what flexibility Sequent would have taking out the parked gas.  Lisa said she didn't know if Enron could sell the gas.

Thanks for the information.  Sell, Sell, Sell!  Sell it all to Sequent for March if you can get a good bid and have them agree to pay the moment we/they get confirmation on the nomination.  Try to get other bids to validate as best you can.  Do not talk to Sonat unless you have to - - asking permission is not advisable.  

Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat.  This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.

ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract.  Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it.  I need to know;

1.  What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.
2.  What period do I sell the gas for?  All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline?  Or base load in April?  I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?
3.  How many bids do I need to get?  I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.
4.  This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).

Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas.  I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.

All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.

Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. 

2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat 
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

2/25/02
Per Kay Mann - Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract.
1:10 PM.  Left a follow-up message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on 2/20/02.

3/11/02
Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal.  Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.

3/13/02
Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled.  Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID.  Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.
3:30 PM  Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it.  She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination.  I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out.
3:40 PM  Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department.

Ok, put me down for 4 Chic Fil A's ($20.00).

Greetings,

I signed up for the MS150 bicycle ride from Houston to Austin on April 20-21.  One requirement is a donation of $300 to the National MS Society.  I hope to raise this minimum amount through contributions from colleagues, friends, and family; thus the purpose of this email.  With your help, you can help me raise funds to help find a cure for MS.  No donation is too small and I will provide you a receipt if necessary.

I've been training for two (2) months and it's been fun.  I've been biking off and on for a few years now but this is my first big two-day race.  And I look forward to the actual ride.

Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, often disabling disease of the central nervous system. Symptoms may be mild such as numbness in the limbs or severe -- paralysis or loss of vision. 
Most people with MS are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40 but the unpredictable physical and emotional effects can be lifelong. The progress, severity and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted, but advances in research and treatment are giving hope to those affected by the disease. 
The National Multiple Sclerosis Society is dedicated to ending the devastating effects of multiple sclerosis.

I'll be glad to share with you my progress and any (exaggerated) road bike stories.  Thanks.

Recommendation for ENA Pools
1st choice  Terminate pools and producer contracts on 12/3/01, no cash flow and everything is pre-petition.
2nd choice Terminate pools and producer contracts on 12/31/01 and deal with one month's cash flow
3rd choice  Terminate pools as soon as possible to eliminate the administrative effort involved.

I've been trying to determine the EES imbalances on Dominion and I'm not having much luck.  Dominion gave me the ENA balances over the phone.  When I called back a day later to get the EES balances, I was told to submit a written request to Bill Saviers, Dominion's in house counsel.  I have not done that.  I would prefer that Dominion provide us a written document stating what the pool balances are as of 11/30/01 and 12/31/01.  

Based on the pool balances below, I would recommend terminating the ENA pools effective 12/3/01 assuming the following.
	1.  Producer payments for Oct and Nov have not been made and go into the pre-petition bucket.
	2.  ENA owes Dominion gas which is also pre-petition.
	3.  The producers will be able to reallocate their gas for December forward to another marketer's pool.

Items to consider
If we terminate the pools on 12/31/01 or later, ENA will need to sell the imbalance gas and pay the producers.  Dominion will need to provide ENA a method to do this if the pools are terminated.  I would recommend paying the producers after we collect the money for selling the imbalance gas AND after we pay Dominion any gathering/transporting charges associated with those balances.  The volumes are small so ENA will not see much economic benefit from this process.  Also, the administrative effort involved is VERY VERY HIGH due to the small volumes per producer.

Dominion will prefer to cancel the pools with a 0 or positive imbalance.  On 12/3/01, ENA will still have a negative cumulative imbalance.

Most of the producers have not been paid for Oct or Nov 2001 activity.  I assume that since those dollars go into a pre-petition bucket that we should not terminate any producer contracts before 12/3/01.

2.  What period do I sell the gas for?  All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline?  Or base load in April?  I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?
3.  How many bids do I need to get?  I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.
4.  This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).

Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas.  I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.

All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.

Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. 

2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat 
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

Per Kay Mann - Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract.
1:10 PM.  Left a follow-up message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on 2/20/02.

3/11/02
Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal.  Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.

3/13/02
Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled.  Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID.  Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.
3:30 PM  Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it.  She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination.  I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out.
3:40 PM  Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department.

3/14/02
9:50 AM Per Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent.  Tammi spoke to Lisa Guthrie (205-325-3816) at Sonat to find out what flexibility Sequent would have taking out the parked gas.  Lisa said she didn't know if Enron could sell the gas.

Thanks for the information.  Sell, Sell, Sell!  Sell it all to Sequent for March if you can get a good bid and have them agree to pay the moment we/they get confirmation on the nomination.  Try to get other bids to validate as best you can.  Do not talk to Sonat unless you have to - - asking permission is not advisable.  

Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat.  This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.

ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract.  Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it.  I need to know;

sorry, not till i hear from legal but we probably won't pay the invoice.  as of right now, don't pay the invoice.
Chris,
 
So do I pay the invoice or not.  I'm a little confused from all the emails.  Please advise.  Thanks.
Kay, ENA has a user ID on a system called Pegasys.  Peoples Gas invoices ENA about $400.00 a month for a License Fee, Customer Service Charge, and taxes and it looks like we have not paid this bill for the last 3 months.  In the pre-petition world, we used this ID to do nominations on the Peoples Gas system.  We are not currently using this ID and it looks like we no longer need an ID for this system.  BUT, Kevin Brady, an ENA scheduler, uses an Enovate and EMW LLC id to do nominations for those companies. Enovate is paying the invoices for those companies.  Can we cancel this ID, or should we just tell Peoples we are not going to pay the invoice and let them terminate the ID at their discretion?  Will not paying the ENA invoice impact EMW LLC or Enovate in any way?

 
 
 
Chris,
I'm familar with the item. It sounds like enovate should pay it if it is enovate access. 
Is this taken care of or do I need to call someone to pay it?  Let me know 
Richard

Hey team.  ENA should be wiring Reliant $25,000.00 today.

I will be out tomorrow and Christina Sanchez (713-345-7791) will be backing me up.

Christina, tomorrow morning, call Jim Taylor (713-207-1482) by 9:00 AM and let him know if we are taking the gas or not.  If Jim isn't there, ask for the person trading Florida.  Malory (don't know her last name or her number) has been backing Jim up this week.  Reliant has the option of giving us the gas in Z2 or Z3 at a Z2 GD price.  Jim will also let us take different volumes on different days over the weekend, even though it hasn't happened before.

Have a good weekend!

 

Do you still chat with Nelson?  GO BUDDY GO!

Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat.  This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.

ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract.  Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it.  I need to know;

1.  What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.
2.  What period do I sell the gas for?  All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline?  Or base load in April?  I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?
3.  How many bids do I need to get?  I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.
4.  This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).

Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas.  I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.

I need to go get a beer with Jim for a little while.  Is that ok?

Ask Marvin or whoever looks at Tenn if they are interested in any Iroq / Tenn capacity.  The capacity goes from Tcpl/Iroq - Wadd to Iroq/Tenn - Wright, then from Iroq/Tenn - Wright to Mendon and Boston Gas citygate.

I've never talked to Ed about any of this.  I just sent him this email the day you and I spoke.  You might forward this on to him with your comments.

Robin is at home.  She tried to call you this morning and I suggested that I just send you an email of some of the items she wanted to discuss and you could call her when you have time.

Melissa, Daniel, didn't know if you had her number on file.  Her number is 713-721-0709.

I hope you are getting somewhere because this is getting annoying.  First he wouldn't send me anything, now they are all over it when he should have just sent me something to begin with.

Chris:

We seem to be on track with a GISB for EES, but little progress has been
made with ENA.  Is Stacy Dickson the right contact for ENA?

Mike

I have asked my legal department about this a couple of times and I'm not
sure if we have sent you anything.  Would you please just send me a GISB
agreement out of your shop.  I see you have spoken to EES already.

Kay, ENA has a user ID on a system called Pegasys.  Peoples Gas invoices ENA about $400.00 a month for a License Fee, Customer Service Charge, and taxes and it looks like we have not paid this bill for the last 3 months.  In the pre-petition world, we used this ID to do nominations on the Peoples Gas system.  We are not currently using this ID and it looks like we no longer need an ID for this system.  BUT, Kevin Brady, an ENA scheduler, uses an Enovate and EMW LLC id to do nominations for those companies. Enovate is paying the invoices for those companies.  Can we cancel this ID, or should we just tell Peoples we are not going to pay the invoice and let them terminate the ID at their discretion?  Will not paying the ENA invoice impact EMW LLC or Enovate in any way?

 
 
 
Chris,
I'm familar with the item. It sounds like enovate should pay it if it is enovate access. 
Is this taken care of or do I need to call someone to pay it?  Let me know

Give me your fax number and I'll fax it over.  Doug Sewell said he would not pay for it as ENA and I don't know enough about the deal to argue with him.  I've pasted in Richard's response is in black below.

Richard

No I am not.  Donna Grief called me on Monday concerning this and I told her we would need Commercial's blessing and then approval by the cash committee.  I agreed to handle it because of the urgency of it needing to be paid.  According to Kim, normally it would appear on a buy/sale ticket and therefore, Margaret Dhont's group would handle this.  I'm not really sure what group should handle it.  Is there an invoice that you can get to me so that I can have it as backup support for the cash request?

Are you familiar with this item?

Beth Jenkins gave me your name as an Enron contact regarding Enovate.

I work for Ed McMichael on the gas side of the Enron Estate team.  Kevin Brady schedules gas for the Enron Estate Team.  Kevin received an invoice from Peoples Energy in the amount of $1,380.44, it looks like this invoice has not been paid in a few months.  I just faxed the invoice to you at 312-541-2728.  This invoice is for a license fee and a customer charge for Pegasys, the system Kevin uses to do nominations on Peoples Gas Light & Coke.  All the activity is for the Enovate deals.  Doug Sewell said that this should be paid by Enovate, not Enron.  Kevin was told by Peoples that if this invoice is not paid, they will terminate Kevin's access.  Do you know who we could forward this too so that it can get processed correctly?

Chris, 
Attached is a draft of a GISB with Sempra.  Please call me if you have any questions.

Stacy 

 

Yesterday I asked you how to go about paying an invoice from Peoples Energy for $1,380.44.  The charges are for a license fee, a customer service, and an outstanding balance of $983.75.  I found out this morning that we are using this system to do nominations for Enovate.  Eric Boyt said he thought the Enron people managing the Enovate deal are Beth Jenkins and J.O. Pagan.  Should I forward this invoice to Beth or J.O.?

Updated schedule through Wednesday 3/13/02.

 

Ruth, I SEE YOU ON THE PHONE OVER THERE.  Probably with Shemin too!

Shemin, I'm sending this to you company email and your Enron email.  Do you use the Enron email system?

Wade said he just received a call from Gary Novenski? at DRI.  Gary was asking Wade if he had any new information.

I'm waiting for Steve Stonestreet to call me back so I can learn how to run all of these reports.

Wade is making copies of the reports he has to give to Ruth.

Is this a new contract on our side to send to them for review?

Chris, 
Attached is a draft of a GISB with Sempra.  Please call me if you have any questions.

 << File: SEMPRAGISB.doc >> 

Ed, this gas was nominated on an IT contract into a pool on NGPL.  I am unable to identify the gas after that so its difficult for me to tell if the estate benefited.  Let me know what you want to do at this point.

Thanks

Assuming all of what is below is all correct, it appears that TDC is
entitled to payment.  The question with administrative priority is whether
the the estate benefitted.  If we took the gas, I assume that we did.
THanks.

3/6/02 2:30 PM just spoke with Louis Schott (504-529-3630  Sr. Vice
President & General Counsel for TDC) - TDC has not filed a claim with the
courts at this time.  TDC is trying to avoid the administrative expense and
expects to be paid $203,196.00.  I told him I would call him back Friday
afternoon and give him a status update.  Please let me know what I can tell
him.  This was an ENA deal.

Do you have Heidi or Jim's number.  They left EES.

Gloria Barkowsky has access to Escript, but she is on vacation this week. I don't know if someone else in Volume Management has access (Rita??).  

Dominion used to send data files to us that, in addition to "current" month allocations and meter statements, may have included imbalance information.

WRP

Kathryn (EES Volume Management) and I are trying to determine what the Dominion Pipeline imbalances are from the Appalachian producers  for EES.  Dominion will not tell us without making a formal request to their legal department.  We may have to do that anyway.  I'm not sure what this report is called, I just know its on a 2 month lag.  I'm also not sure if this report was mailed to us or if we could run it out of Escript (Dominion's EBB).  If it was run out of Escript, then someone in volume management should know how to do it and that person could show me.  If the report was mailed to us, then I'll have to make a formal request to Dominion's legal department.

Don't spend more than 10 minutes trying to figure out how to do this.  If the person that handled Dominion is gone, then I'll just go the "legal" route.

Are you going to San Antonio Friday?  Is the little woman going with you - maybe make it a romantic encounter?

All my Sonat notes.

These are my notes on the Sonat Park & Loan.  I have not spoken with any legal counsel representing ENA.

Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. 

ENA recognizes a balance of 197,537 dth - the difference is ENA is not netting the 96,000 dth Loan with the park and Sonat is showing an additional day of withdrawal of 8,588 dth in January 2002.

Chris's notes:
Sonat Park & Loans

2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat 
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount went the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

Yes I did but....we lost our list of who gave us what.  All though its pretty easy to see who gave me the litte Duff with the black nose.

Did you get Duffy's presents?

jtownse1965: it's freezing up here
jtownse1965: baby boppee
Trogg 522: i can't do any work without outlook
jtownse1965: don't know what happened

I got this.

I received your fax.

Questions:  at the top of the page from Dominion, it states that "effective FEBRUARY 2002 Production ... WILL NOT BE CREDITED".  One of the column titles on the sheet is EFFECTIVE DATE.  What does this effective date stand for.

Also, were you able to find a contract for The Central Pacific Group?

Let me know if you get this.  Outlook is up but I don't have any email for today which is odd.

I just received a call from Joe Krajewski (617-723-5512 x4731) at Boston Gas.  He is a Resource Management Analyst at Boston Gas working for Liz Danehy.  According to Joe, ENA is still billing Boston Gas for part of the demand charges on the long term producer netback deal (that Ruth is so familiar with).  This is Iroquois and Tennessee capacity I am releasing back to Boston Gas each month at a 100% demand rate.

Joe asked me why we were doing this and I told him that ENA was probably not paying the capacity bills and Boston Gas was aware of that fact and knew Boston Gas would be liable for the demand charges anyway.  Sounds like Boston Gas may be getting double billed and Joe said they will probably not pay the invoice.

There are 2 Con Eds and I believe this is a contact for the unregulated side.
Mario Karlovic  914-993-2153.

I don't think Chevron-Texaco has a trading group other than Dynegy.

Joe, Chris, Ruth -

Do you have contacts at Chevron-Texaco, and ConEd that I could call regarding the auction of the gas contracts ?

Thanks.

Galveston sounds good to me.

Since I got such an overwhelming response from everyone (Clarissa is the ONLY one that responded to my email...) about happy hour tonight and based on the rumors that I am hearing that a few people had WAY too much to drink last night, we are moving Steve's birthday happy hour to next week.  He says anyday is fine with him so if anyone has any preferences of where to go or when, please let me know.

This is my Reliant Energy schedule.  I send this to all the people you see below at least twice a week.  I'm only doing business with them at one point and they are making money off Enron.  But he has agreed to give me a little operational flexibility over the weekends if I need it.  I send them a wire every Thursday, unless its like this week where prices ran up and I had to send it on Wednesday.  

Have a good weekend!

 

I have asked my legal department about this a couple of times and I'm not sure if we have sent you anything.  Would you please just send me a GISB agreement out of your shop.  I see you have spoken to EES already.

The two attachments show all the contracts that are active for ENA per Columbia's system effective 12/01/2001 and 06/01/2002.  This might be handy to have when we talk to Steve today.  The file name tells you what effective date I used on the report.  The effective date is also shown in the upper right part of the report as well.  The column in the far left indicates which pipeline the contract is for; TCO is Columbia Gas and CGT is Columbia Gulf.

 

 

The attachments below show all the active contracts for Columbia Energy Services (CES) and Columbia Gas Marketing (CGM) for the same time frame.  ENA is agent for both of these companies.

  

  

I believe CMS Marketing, Services and Trading Company should be added.  Per Sylvia's notes, the contact their is Tim Spurlin.  His number is 713-230-7427.  I have not contacted CMS about being added to the list.

FYI

Eric, Vicky:

Attached please find the revised MCV potential bidder list:

 << File: Contacts for MCV Auction.xls >> 

The document is also saved in the following folder:  o:\gas Structuring\Bankruptcy Folder\MCV\

This is includes the additional 16 companies that Ed suggested be kept on the list.  I have called all of the companies they all expressed interest, with the exception of TransCanada which sold its gas marketing company.

As long as I don't have to change diapers I'm a happy camper.  I saw someone do that on TV once, yeeeech!

This is too funny.  Leave it to a man to ask for these things...nothing but
play toys...you better get used to squeaky toys, rattles and playing hide
and go seek and patty cake for A LONG LONG LONG time Chris...you are last on
the list once the baby arrives....but it's all worth it.

Having visions is a guy thing you know.  I just thought Nanny Terri would be good at teaching little Christopher about acting and Nanny Natilie (huba huba huba) could teach the little sucker how to sing.

Chris,
We will DEFINITELY pass the word and be sure to tell  anyone that calls
wondering what the BABY will need.  And of course we will try and get you a
little something from your baby wish list too.

I can just see the baby now....sitting on HIS Harley, watching HIS big
screen TV, daydreaming about the lake and HIS blue wave boat, while
wondering which one of HIS cars Mommie will be "borrowing" when she picks
him up from day care...or maybe he has visions of Nanny Terri Hatcher or
Nanny Natilie Imbruglia driving him in one of HIS cars.

Scottie

 

Let me know if you see this.

Thanks
Chris Germany

I've tried to send this back to Scottie twice.  Would you please forward it to her?  She will be needing this list.

Thanks

3/6/02 2:30 PM just spoke with Louis Schott (504-529-3630  Sr. Vice President & General Counsel for TDC) - TDC has not filed a claim with the courts at this time.  TDC is trying to avoid the administrative expense and expects to be paid $203,196.00.  I told him I would call him back Friday afternoon and give him a status update.  Please let me know what I can tell him.  This was an ENA deal.

If is was an ENA deal, the Dec. 3 is correct post-petition date.

I don't have anything on my list from TDC.  Won't hurt to call them anyway.

Kay

Summary:  TDC Energy Corporation is requesting payment of $203,196.00 from ENA for post-petition gas that flowed in the month of December 2001 (sitara deal #1143983).  TDC stated that it would "file a claim for administrative expenses in the bankruptcy court in New York and seek all other necessary relief against ENA" if ENA did not remit payment by the close of business Feb 22, 2002.  Based on the information in this email it appears that ENA should pay TDC $203,196.00.  

Kay, Ed, Question:  I have not contacted TDC to determine if they have filed a claim with the court.  Would that have any impact on making a payment to TDC?  Should I contact TDC?

Calculation of Post-Petition Payment using Dec 3 as Post-Petition day
Gas scheduled Dec 3-24, 26-31 = 28 days, volume = 3,000 dth per day
28 x 3,000 x $2.419 = $203,196.00

we took 3000 a day everyday except the 25th

I need your expertise.  If ENA nominated this gas, and I think we did based on what I see in Unify, then we are supposed to pay for it.  So I just need to verify with you  we TOOK this gas by nominating it.

Deal 1143983 on Natural Gas Pipeline Company.

thanks  

	Sitara# 1143983

Do you have a deal number for this gas?

I contacted Mary Ellenberger.  She indicated we did receive the gas but have not paid.  I suggested that she contact you via email.  

Have we determined if the facts in the letter are correct?  I've confirmed that if the facts are true, the payment needs to be made.

Kay
All I need to know is if ENA received the gas as stated, and if there are any extenuating circumstances which would keep us from paying.  Otherwise I believe we need to make payments in accordance with the terms of the deal.  I'll confirm.

Kay

Attached is a demand letter w/ short time fuse.  Counterparty wants payment for post-petition gas delivered to Enron.  Please advise if you need commercial involvement.  Thanks

Shemin, Kathryn (EES Logistics) is going to send me some information on EES. I'm going to summarize the date for ENA and EES and resend this email, hopefully within the next hour or so.

Chris,
I need you to lead the effort to work with/through legal to fully explore our alternatives and then recommend a solution to resolve.  PwC and Weil probably need to be informed of your efforts.  If you have any questions, please ask.
Ed

Listed below are ENA's pool balances as of 11/30/01 and 12/31/01.  From ENA's perspective, I would prefer to terminate the pools effective 11/30/01.  That would leave ENA with a negative pre-petition imbalance on Dominion and ENA would not have to pay the producers for December production or worry about selling a positive imbalance in an un-friendly market.  However, Dominion will probably not let ENA terminate the pools until 12/31/2001 due to the negative cumulative imbalance.

Questions that need to be answered, 
	** will ENA have to pay the producers for December (possibly January) production if Dominion will not let ENA terminate the pools any earlier?
	** how will Dominion handle the positive imbalance if the pool is terminated on 12/31/01 or later?

	

The operations contact at Dominion is Iris King (304-627-3213), she is one of the managers over the operations group.  In my opinion, we should terminate the pools as early as possible.

Hi Chris,
I am just checking to see whether you sent me your conclusions regarding
whether ENA should terminate the pooling agreement with Dominion. Do we
still need to speak with Iris? And, can we set up a meeting with Ed
McMichael so that we can make a decision and move forward? Please call
(5-3910) or email me.
Thanks,
Shemin

Kathryn, add whatever comments you have especially the one about going back to sep, then i'm going to rewrite this email and send it out to all these people down below.

Kay, who should I work with at Weil?
Jeff, Loretta, are you the right contacts for me at PwC?
Shemin, my first queston for you is will ENA have to pay the producers for December (possibly January)?  
Kathryn, what are the imbalances for EES on 11/30/01

I've added Kathryn Bussell to the list.  Kathryn is over the EES Logistics group.  EES has been signing some of the producer letters allowing the producers

I spoke with Steve Stonestreet at Columbia Gas.  He will do a conference call with us tomorrow.  I told him it would probably be around our lunch time.  He said that is fine.  I can set up a time tomorrow.  His boss, Jeanne Adkins, told him she doesn't need to be there if we are just talking about the mechanics of how the producer gas flows.

Shawn seems like a nice person.  You should take her out to eat then I'll take you out to eat.

ok, now i feel like i'm doing somethig worthwhile.

If it makes you feel better, I forward it to 2 other people!

   I've requested a prepayment for Wed in the amount of $42,000.00 due
the
   rise in cash prices.  I've also added a new and exciting "Summary"
tab
   to the worksheet.  That shows when the wires are made and my summary
   purchases for the month.  One thing I don't have access to is any
   information that identifies the wire.

   Jim, Pete, Shawn, let me know if you have anything you would like me

Moved the prepay to Wednesday.  The amount is $42,000.00 due to the spike in pirces.

 

Per my discussion with Sherry Glazebrook at Tennessee, she wasn't real specific since I don't have an EES ID on Tennessee but this is what I found out.

CONTRACTS

Balancing Agreement K# 31905 (OBAD)  This is a balancing agreement for Bethlehem on the 200 leg in Zone 5, probably meter #20816.  This balancing agreement should have been cashed out every month.  She wouldn't tell me the current balance.  ENA had a term sale to EES (sitara #1003036).  The volume was 1,200 dth per day in Tenn Zone 5 and the name of the point was Bethlehem Sales.  The term of the sale matches the term of the capacity release from Boston Gas.
Firm Gas Storage Service K# 38454 (FS-MA Assign) -- Assignment from New York State Electric & Gas Company
Gas Transportation Agreement K# 38535 (FT-A Assign) -- Assignment from New York State Electric & Gas Company
Gas Transportation Agreement K# 38539 (FT-A Assign) -- Assignment from New York State Electric & GAs Company   All 3 capacity releases from NYSEG are non-recallable.  In my opinion, this capacity should be the property of the customers EES was serving behind the NYSEG city gate and the capacity should go with the customers.  But, I believe we need to address the LDC tariff issues along with the pipeline issues.
Gas Transportation Agreement K#27848 (IT)   
Supply Aggregation Servic e Agreement K# 80265 (SA)

Of all the items shown above, I am more concerned with the Balancing Agreement k#31905.  We need to know what has happened to the sales customers EES had at this point.  I believe it was just one customer.  How is this customer currently getting its gas?  If Enron is still the operator of the balancing agreement at this point, does it "appear" that Enron is still using this agreement?

Tennessee Gas Pipeline has made a global Enron bankruptcy filing.  We have checked the information that EES provided earlier to Maria and there was no retail contracts on Tennessee Gas Pipeline shown.  Tennessee shows the following six active contracts with Enron Energy Services, Inc.  Please provide some additional clarification including the following information so that Enron can decide how to best respond to the filing.

INFORMATION REQUIRED

Is the contract active or how/when did EES dispose of it?
Did EES nominate under the agreements since November 30, 2001?  If so, provide nomination by day.
Does EES need to retain the contract?
How much pre-petition and post-petition claims are due to Tennessee?
Are there any contract imbalances remaining that need resolution?
For transport assignments, can contract be re-released back to NYSEG?
Can EES provide a copy of the contract, capacity posting and back-up information for the bankruptcy files?

As always, there is a short turnaround time to complete Enron's response to the filing.

Please respond by Monday, March 4th.

Steve is working with the admins to see who needs what, CQG, Reuters,..... things like that.

Hi everybody. It's Steve Cooper. It's Friday afternoon, March 1. I hope everybody has had a great week. I want to update everybody on a number of things that have gone on this week, so that you all will be fully in the loop. 
The week started in a rough-and-tumble fashion. I went to a town meeting Monday night to meet with a number of our ex-colleagues. Their disappointment, upset and anger is very understandable. I, along with the entire management team, have committed that we are going to try to do whatever we can to fashion a reasonable resolution to their various issues. 
In order to make sure that those that are truly in need have something to fall back on, we asked the court later in the week and got the judge to approve an emergency $5 million fund. We are now going to fish around for an independent administrator to evaluate the needs and disperse those dollars to former employees. I wanted you to be aware of that. I really do appreciate and understand everybody's upset. 
Last Friday, February 22, we presented to the Creditors' Committee a formal proposal on a retention and severance program. As can be expected, there was some push back from the committee -- there were issues about some of the data, there were requests for additional data and further clarification. 
The Creditors' Committee formed a subcommittee. We provided to them more data. Jeff McMahon and I met with them on Wednesday, February 27, and we met with them again on Thursday, February 28. We are scheduled to meet with them again on Monday and Tuesday to resolve all the open issues and to get the full support and endorsement of the Creditors' Committee on this program. 
I have indicated to the subcommittee that getting a plan in place is Jeff's and my highest priority. It is not right or fair for anyone to be in a state of ongoing uncertainty about their future, their future compensation, and any financial safety net, so we are going to have to move on this at light speed. I told the creditors' subcommittee and asked that they tell the full committee that we want to be in a position by the week of March 11 to motion this up to the court. I'll keep you posted on progress. I am comfortable that the committee wants to put in place the retention and severance program and now we are just working out the bugs. Hopefully, by the time we have the employee meeting, we can walk through the composition of the program in detail. 
The powers that be - management in conjunction with the human resources group - are working on merit increases and promotions. Hopefully all the details of a program will be finalized next week. Then, the process is typically that business unit managers begin to calculate salary increases. And it works its way through the review, approval and communication process. So hopefully, we'll have that all resolved in the next week or two and everyone will know where they stand with respect to promotions and merit increases. 
We reached an accord with the Astros this week to repatriate to Enron $2.1 million for the release of our rights to the naming contract. It is a shame we won't be in a position to support the naming of the field, but it is probably in the best interest of the estate. I got a great suggestion from one of our colleagues about auctioning Enron Field signs and contributing net proceeds to the ex-employees' fund. I'd like your input on that. I thought it was a great idea and very generous. 
We are moving forward with plans for an employee meeting later this month. Hopefully I'll be able to meet many of you there. I've tried to get around to say hello here and there. And again, I would encourage you if you have any questions, concerns or issues just give me an email or a buzz. Sometimes it takes a few days for me to get back to you, but I'm making a very concerted effort to answer everybody's inquiries. 
Other than that I don't have a lot to report. We'll continue to hammer out with the committee the retention program. Hopefully by next Friday I'll be able to report very substantial progress in this area. I want to thank everybody for their efforts, all their hard work and their focus on moving things forward. 
One other thing... 
We did have a bank meeting on Thursday afternoon. We have described to the banks what we believe is a very reorganizable entity here. We'll be sharing more about that at the employee meeting. I told the bank group, and it was echoed by management, that we believe there is a reorganizable, viable entity in Enron's future. I'll bring you all fully up to speed on that at the employee meeting. 
Anyway, as I was saying... 
Thanks so much for all your hard work, your efforts, your dedication. I hope you have a great weekend. I'll chat with next week. 

Cash prices have jumped over $.20 since Friday.  I may need to make my prepayment on Wednesday for Reliant and I've bumped up the amout to $42,000 for this week.  I will have a much better idea by 9:00 tomorrow of course.

I am micro-managing this deal and I don't want it to catch you by surprise.  If you look at my schedule for March, you will see that it is possible for ENA to have a negative cash balance with Reliant before I make the Thursday prepay based on the daily spike in prices.  I get the estimated prices from Jim.  Do you want me to make a prepayment on Wednesday or are you comfortable with the regular Thursday prepayment?  I need to know by tomorrow morning.  I have to request prepayments the day before the wire goes out.

Thanks

I'm not aware of an AP rate schedule.  AS (tariff sheet #205) and IPP
(tariff sheet #215) are separate rate schedules in the tariff.  AS pools
are used to aggregate production meters on CGAS's system and are assigned a
specific geographical location on the pipeline.  AS pool meters can be used
as primary receipt points on firm transportation agreements whereas IPP
Pool meters are not.

Cash till Williams does a little better.   I'm swinging back to pizza now.

Chrissy,

Always in the past I've had my stock dividends re-invested as stock.  We can
make an election every year as to whether we get our dividends in stock,
cash, or 50/50.  I wonder if this year I should get the cash or if I should
just keep doing stock.  Any thoughts?

i

I did submit a request via "e Request" - #83213.  I didn't know if you wanted to assign other people to do this and I don't know HOW you would do that either.  I just asked for everything to cover all the bases.

You don't need UBS approval for access to estate files.

Did you submit a request for access.  I will approve.

You can not have access to AEP info however.

thanks

bob

I hope I have the right Bob Hall.  I'm trying to get sitara access to the West and Texas Desk and they have not been approved yet.  I'm waiting for Phillip Love (now with UBS) to approve the West and O'Neal Winfree (not sure who this is) to approve the Texas Desk.

Tommy Yanowski was able to help with a couple of these but it looks like we need to get the approving parties changed.

I also left a message for the help desk about this.

Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.

Thanks

 

I'm not aware of an AP rate schedule.  AS (tariff sheet #205) and IPP (tariff sheet #215) are separate rate schedules in the tariff.  AS pools are used to aggregate production meters on CGAS's system and are assigned a specific geographical location on the pipeline.  AS pool meters can be used as primary receipt points on firm transportation agreements whereas IPP Pool meters are not.

can you help?  Please review the attachment and let's discuss.
Ed

Shemin, can you answer Ed Smith's question concerning the pooling tarriff?

Ed McMichael, do you have knowledge concerning the EES pooling agreements?

Two quick questions:

1.   The Columbia Gas motion refers to two pooling agreements, the IPP
Service Agreement and the AS Service     Agreement.  Ms. Shemin's e mail
attaches a copy of a rate schedule entitled "IPP Rate Schedule
Interruptible  Paper Pools."   Does this rate schedule also apply to the AP
Service Agreement, or is there another rate        schedule for that
agreement?.

2.   Can Mr. McMichael swear the affidavit with respect to the pooling
agreements, which are with EES, not ENA?

I was getting an error messge until I downloaded something from the IOL Setup & Help tab.  
Now, I go to http://www.iroquois.com/igts/info/section-frame.html and select "Transportation" at the top of the screen.  
Then I select "Customer Activities" from the left side of the screen.
And this is where I used to get an error message, now I just get a small symbol - looks like some sort of "flash" plug in is not loaded.

Good morning Chris:

Please tell me your exact problem in getting into the EBB or the error message
that you got or just a general description of what happened when you clicked on
Customer Activities on our website.

Yes, the capacity was awarded to Boston Gas.  I sent an email message to Jeff
LoConte and Liz Danehy about the release.  Haven't heard back from them.  I
told them they can nom on the released quantity.

FYI, I just bumped up the forecast for next week from $19,000 to $37,000 because Tallahassee took the swing gas for the weekend.  I've also put a manual date and time on my swing gas cash forecast worksheet.

Updated forecast for next week attached.  

 << File: 3-1-02 Gas Cash.xls >> 

of course, its my perrrrogative to changemy mind and go burger hopping.

Yum, with only veggies on my half.

Sounds like a pizza night to me.

How about something nourishing and not too fatty?  Take care of your temple!

I leaving for the day.  I'm going to drop by Shemin's office (if I can remember which one it is) and leave what I have on the contracts.  It's slow going because it takes a long time for the contracts to pop up on the screen.

Wonder where I should go to lunch today?  Maybe the BOOOOOFEEEEEET!!!

I still am unable to get into the EBB.  Did the capacity get awared to Boston Gas?

Chris:

The offer is now on our Iroquois OnLine system and has an offer number of 50153.  The only thing I've added is Liz Dennehy's email address which I have as ldenehy@keyspanenergy.com.

Also the offer term end date is 4/1/2002 at 09:00.  If I left it at your 3/31/2002 09:00 then they wouldn't be able to nominate it on the very last day of the month.  Please let me know if that is ok.  Thanks.

Ed is asking me if we followed up or if we need to follow up.  Please let me know.  I am also going to send you an email of the letter we sent to Tallahassee.  

Chris/Kay,
We need to make sure that COT is properly notified in accordance with the contract.  Please confirm.
Thanks,

I just went over the March prepayment with David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion.  On Thursday, ENA will wire $280,306.00 to Dominion.  The Force Majeure event has ended and Dominion will resume deliveries effective 2/26/02.  We are assuming Dominion did not deliver any gas for Feb 8th through Feb 25th, 18 days.  Following are my calculations

	Prepay for March 2002			10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422.00
	Non deliveries for Feb 2002	           10,000 dth per day x 18 days x $2.1562 = ($388,116.00)

						Amount to wire on 2/28/02 ==>		$280,306.00

There may have been some gas flow on Feb 8th, but David will let us know about that later.

Doug, do I need to prepare a new Cash Use Approval Request form?

I'm requesting the prepay for Dominion for March 2002.  I printed out the request, signed it, and gave it to Doug.  I just want everyone to be aware of what is happening with Dominion.  Dominion is still not delivering the gas to Tallahassee due to a Force Majeure event.  We are expecting gas to flow any day, hopefully by the weekend.

Eric, I left a message for David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion to call me about the prepayment amount.  Following are my calculations

Prepay for March 2002		10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422
Non deliveries for Feb 2002	10,000 dth per day x 14 days x $2.1562 = ($301,868)

				Estimated payment due 2/28/02	               $366,554

As of today Mops has been down from Feb 8th - 21st, 14 days.  Mops may not come up until the weekend or early next week.  I will adjust the prepayment as needed next week.
	

 << File: Dominion Prepay (1.29.02 for $603,736)_update.doc >> 

I need your expertise.  If ENA nominated this gas, and I think we did based on what I see in Unify, then we are supposed to pay for it.  So I just need to verify with you  we TOOK this gas by nominating it.

Deal 1143983 on Natural Gas Pipeline Company.

thanks  

	Sitara# 1143983

Do you have a deal number for this gas?

I contacted Mary Ellenberger.  She indicated we did receive the gas but have not paid.  I suggested that she contact you via email.  

Have we determined if the facts in the letter are correct?  I've confirmed that if the facts are true, the payment needs to be made.

Kay
All I need to know is if ENA received the gas as stated, and if there are any extenuating circumstances which would keep us from paying.  Otherwise I believe we need to make payments in accordance with the terms of the deal.  I'll confirm.

Enbridge is going to send me an invoice tonight or tomorrow.  They have been sending us and invoice each month.  I'll get back to you.  I just know we owe money on this and I hope its not more than what we are making on the deal.

yes sir

The pmt won't be till next month though right?

Hey, I don't think you should show any cash flow for the Enbridge storage until I talk to them this afternoon.  I'm writing an email to you and a few others about what I think we should forcast and I want to talk to them first.  But between you and me, I'm thinking we show about $600,000 or so.

FYI:  Pipeline name change.  Not sure who this might impact.  At least I don't see any deals in Sitara on this pipeline.

There will be a quiz tomorrow afternoon at 4:45 PM.

Okay, not sure who, if anyone, cares or needs to know BUT . . . . 

Stingray Pipeline Company (34271) has been changed to Stingray Pipeline Company, L.L.C. (200104). This change created a new Global Counterparty number so it prompted manual changes to the Pipeline Name & Pipeline Counterparty data within Global Facilities. It also prompted the need to move (via assignment within Global Contracts) all service related agreements from the old GCP record to the new GCP record. I left both names on the Global Record, BUT due to system controls can only have 1 listed with the role of "Pipeline". This role was assigned to the "new" name & the old name (which is now a suspended GCP record) was made "Alternate Payee". This was a "guess" role - - - - and I have no idea of how the service side is impacted or at what level it validates the Global record attached to the deal. All contract services are the same on each record, but the role of "Pipeline" now resides with the new GCP.

Can you either let all those who need to know - - - know & let me know who/how should I share information like this in the future. You got a Transportation Greenie (just 'learned' how to change pipeline names today) over here.

Thanks so much!!
Cyndie

done

Chris,

Be sure to call the electric co. to transfer your service.  It supposedly
takes them 3 business days to do a transfer, so I couldn't have mine
back-dated to when I moved.  I'm not sure how they'll work out the bills,
but I'm sure we'll get boo-foo'd somehow.

The number is (713) 207-7777.

I'm leaving soon to go to the Doc.

ii

This doesn't have everything on it AND i thought about just doing something more like a summary thingy with pretty much the same info on it.  I want you to take a look and tell me what you think.  I actually think a summary thingy, sorta like the info we used to have on the grease boards for bid week, would be easier to look at.  Give me your thoughts.

 

Ain't that the truth.  Wait just a minute, I took Monday off and I think I'm taking Friday of next week off.  Never mind.

Five day work weeks are VERY long.  I haven't had one in a few weeks.

Space from Niagara to Leidy is available for 35,000 dth.  Excess injection or IAS payback is available for 20,000 dth and excess withdrawals can increase by 100,000 dth for tomorrow's gas day.

Joe Van Zandt with Dominion Field Services wants to know if we are going to nominate his gas for the first.  Their are 3 fixed price deals and 1 Index + $.10 deal.  I can't find the deals in the system.  What should I tell him legally besides NO?

Per my discussion with Dave Evans - MidAmerican agreed to pay ENA for this gas and will not net this deal with any other deal.  We also discussed doing this deal under a GISB agreement but if we have some other post-bankruptcy agreement that we can trade under then that's fine with me.  You and Stacy can decide if we need to put any of this information on the confirm.
 
Stacy also has some comments below pertaining to the GST tax that should may need to be included in the confirm.  I did not discuss the GST tax, I felt fortunate that someone would do business with me.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the  GST which is a per cent of the purchase price.  The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority.  In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.   If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated"  so it is not subject to the GST.
 
Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments?  I hope we still have someone who can do that.  
 
Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Opps.  Didn't mean to hit send it just yet.  Much better now. 

Cc:     Fowler, Kulvinder; Schumack, Sherlyn 
Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal. 

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 

        1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to 
        2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address? 

Any comments or questions? 

Listed below are some of the companies ENA has done business with at Dawn

yes sir

The pmt won't be till next month though right?

Hey, I don't think you should show any cash flow for the Enbridge storage until I talk to them this afternoon.  I'm writing an email to you and a few others about what I think we should forcast and I want to talk to them first.  But between you and me, I'm thinking we show about $600,000 or so.

Just sold 10,000 MMBtu per day at Dawn to MidAmerican Energy Company at $2.47 for March.  My contact at MidAmerican is Dave Evans (515-281-2698).  Dave said he was using Apr Nymx + $.05 to calculate his price.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the  GST which is a per cent of the purchase price.  The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority.  In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.   If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated"  so it is not subject to the GST.
 
Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments?  I hope we still have someone who can do that.  
 
Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal. 

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 

        1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to 
        2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address?

Works for me.

thanks

After determining who is available over the next few weeks, I suggest we not meet the next 2 Tuesdays.  We will pick back up with Session 4 on July 16.

Thx!
Bill

I misunderstood. I thought it was ok to pay based on my email from last week.  My contact at LD  (David Walker) asked me about this amount last week.  He didn't mention any other outstanding items.

No - do not pay.  We will resolve this amount with the settlement with Louis Dreyfus.  Does LD want to resolve all issues at this time? 
Ed

I am requesting a payment to Dominion Oklahoma (aka Louis Dreyfus) in the amount of $10,334.67.  This payment is for gas that flowed in Feb 2002 to the City Of Tallahassee.  According to Max Doner, ENA billed Tallahassee for the incremental volumes and Tallahassee paid for the gas.

Doug, Drew, I am requesting the payment to be made on Monday, June 17th.  I will get the wire request from settlements, attach the supporting documents, get Ed's signature, and leave it with Susan.  I assume Susan will pass it on to one of you after she approves it.  Is that how the process works these days?

 << File: Dominion Payment for Feb 2002 Adjustment.doc >> 

I printed this out and gave it to Doug.  My prepay amount for Thur is $19,000.00.  

 

You are welcome.  

Thank you!

Updated schedule through Thursday, Feb 28th.  ENA will wire $19,000.00
to Reliant tomorrow afternoon.

Thanks Ivy.  Your end date is correct.

Chris:

The offer is now on our Iroquois OnLine system and has an offer number of 50153.  The only thing I've added is Liz Dennehy's email address which I have as ldenehy@keyspanenergy.com.

Also the offer term end date is 4/1/2002 at 09:00.  If I left it at your 3/31/2002 09:00 then they wouldn't be able to nominate it on the very last day of the month.  Please let me know if that is ok.  Thanks.

I just went over the March prepayment with David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion.  On Thursday, ENA will wire $280,306.00 to Dominion.  The Force Majeure event has ended and Dominion will resume deliveries effective 2/26/02.  We are assuming Dominion did not deliver any gas for Feb 8th through Feb 25th, 18 days.  Following are my calculations

	Prepay for March 2002			10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422.00
	Non deliveries for Feb 2002	           10,000 dth per day x 18 days x $2.1562 = ($388,116.00)

						Amount to wire on 2/28/02 ==>		$280,306.00

There may have been some gas flow on Feb 8th, but David will let us know about that later.

Doug, do I need to prepare a new Cash Use Approval Request form?

I'm requesting the prepay for Dominion for March 2002.  I printed out the request, signed it, and gave it to Doug.  I just want everyone to be aware of what is happening with Dominion.  Dominion is still not delivering the gas to Tallahassee due to a Force Majeure event.  We are expecting gas to flow any day, hopefully by the weekend.

Eric, I left a message for David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion to call me about the prepayment amount.  Following are my calculations

Prepay for March 2002		10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422
Non deliveries for Feb 2002	10,000 dth per day x 14 days x $2.1562 = ($301,868)

				Estimated payment due 2/28/02	               $366,554

As of today Mops has been down from Feb 8th - 21st, 14 days.  Mops may not come up until the weekend or early next week.  I will adjust the prepayment as needed next week.

Tommy, I see you didn't approve my access for AEP which is fine.  I only need access to all the Estate desks and I just asked Daniel to give me everything because I don't know where the deals are for the other desk.  I didn't know if the Central Desk deals are under Central Desk or one of their many other books.  I think I just need Central, East, West, and Texas.

But, maybe you can help.  My request for the Central Desk needs Darron Giron's approval and he's not in the People Finder.  So he's either at UBS or he left the company.  Do you know who I should be approving that now?

Thanks

Congratulations!!  I would walk over and hassle your "MAN" but I don't see him.

Just wanted to let all of you know that there's going to be another wedding
in the future!

Brent and I got engaged on Thursday night.  He completely surprised me with
a beautiful ring and a nice dinner at Mark's after spending an hour at the
Museaum of Fine Arts.  We're planning to have the wedding in Tulsa next
March, but have not set a definative date yet.

It's been a wonderful few days and I'm slowly getting used to having jewerly
on that finger.  (After a few scratches, I must admit.)

I just thought everyone should know since I've been harrassed about this
event for quite some time now.  :)  Hope all is well everyone!

Angie

Just a reminder that we still need to discuss the physical deals with volumes in the sitara for March.  You said we were going to talk to Bob Hall about that today.

FYI, I'm sure these are not in the system yet but will be soon.

	I verbally confirmed the wiring information with Mario.  The wire needs to go out on Feb. 27.  I have requested that Mario email me 
	all the pertinent information just to doublecheck.  I will forward you the email when I receive it.  I will do the cash request next.

I just went over the March prepayment with David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion.  On Thursday, ENA will wire $280,306.00 to Dominion.  The Force Majeure event has ended and Dominion will resume deliveries effective 2/26/02.  We are assuming Dominion did not deliver any gas for Feb 8th through Feb 25th, 18 days.  Following are my calculations

	Prepay for March 2002			10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422.00
	Non deliveries for Feb 2002	           10,000 dth per day x 18 days x $2.1562 = ($388,116.00)

						Amount to wire on 2/28/02 ==>		$280,306.00

There may have been some gas flow on Feb 8th, but David will let us know about that later.

Doug, do I need to prepare a new Cash Use Approval Request form?

I'm requesting the prepay for Dominion for March 2002.  I printed out the request, signed it, and gave it to Doug.  I just want everyone to be aware of what is happening with Dominion.  Dominion is still not delivering the gas to Tallahassee due to a Force Majeure event.  We are expecting gas to flow any day, hopefully by the weekend.

Eric, I left a message for David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion to call me about the prepayment amount.  Following are my calculations

Prepay for March 2002		10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422
Non deliveries for Feb 2002	10,000 dth per day x 14 days x $2.1562 = ($301,868)

				Estimated payment due 2/28/02	               $366,554

As of today Mops has been down from Feb 8th - 21st, 14 days.  Mops may not come up until the weekend or early next week.  I will adjust the prepayment as needed next week.

I have an id - what kind of form are you talking about?

it has been setting on my desk for a week - if you want me to do it - and you need a id - you need to fill out a form

oh no, i insist that you do it since you started the process.  i'm such a laggard.

I was in the process of setting this up, but I got side tracked!  I was going to be administrator - but please feel free to do it yourself,
you know more about it than me!

I'm going to kill all the ID's shown below except mine.  Should I set up anyone else with an ID?

I know.  I'm gong to recommend zeroing out the deal in sitara under "expected volumes".

chris - if you zero expected volume out in sitara - it will zero deal out in unify..  In the past , this has been done by risk

I just showed Ed McMichael the sitara position screens for the East and Central Desk for March 1st.  There are volumes all over the place.  I asked him who should be taking these volumes to 0 since most of these deals are not physically flowing.  Ed is going to discuss this in a meeting with Bob Hall today.  

I guess my next question is should the volume be taken to 0 in Sitara or Unify.

Can you guys think of any other questions along those lines?

I zeroed out the 33000/d for March - let me know if you hear anything about this deal. 

Thanks

kf

I'm not sure if it should be terminated but to my knowledge we are not serving this deal so it probably should be terminated.  I'm going to a "terminated contracts" meeting this morning so maybe I will find out more about how this works.  I also don't see any volumes on this deal for March.

I did have those set up pretty quick.

You failed to mention what you were doing yesterday. Trying to find the
remote?

I'm telling you life just can't get any better!!!!  We spent our first
night together Friday night.  Of course we both have colds / allergies real
bad so it was a sniffly experience.  It will take some getting used to
thats for sure.  She was trying to set up the kitchen yesterday, bless her
pregnant heart.

Could you tell me who in legal is assigned to this?

thanks
These are my notes on the Sonat Park & Loan.  I have not spoken with any legal counsel representing ENA.

Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. 

ENA recognizes a balance of 197,537 dth - the difference is ENA is not netting the 96,000 dth Loan with the park and Sonat is showing an additional day of withdrawal of 8,588 dth in January 2002.

Chris's notes:
Sonat Park & Loans

2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat 
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount went the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

Do you have a deal number for this gas?

I contacted Mary Ellenberger.  She indicated we did receive the gas but have not paid.  I suggested that she contact you via email.  

Have we determined if the facts in the letter are correct?  I've confirmed that if the facts are true, the payment needs to be made.

Kay
All I need to know is if ENA received the gas as stated, and if there are any extenuating circumstances which would keep us from paying.  Otherwise I believe we need to make payments in accordance with the terms of the deal.  I'll confirm.

Kay

Attached is a demand letter w/ short time fuse.  Counterparty wants payment for post-petition gas delivered to Enron.  Please advise if you need commercial involvement.  Thanks

According to Iroq the problem is on our side.  Please call me first think Monday morning at 3-4743.  Following is the address that I'm starting at.  I go to this address and click on "Customer Activities" and that's when I get the error message.  It should ask me for my ID and password.

I'm at ECS 04425 if you decide to come by my desk.  I'm out for the rest of the day.

Kay, per my voicemail, I need to meet with you, Ed, Shemin, and Wade to discuss how to handle producers that are still "attached" to ENA's pools on Dominion Pipeline.  This should be a short (less than 30 minutes) meeting.  Shemin and I are available anytime Monday after lunch.  I believe Ed is available after lunch as well.  Please let Daniel and I know when you are available after lunch on Monday and Daniel will get us a conference room.

The file you guys sent is July 2001!!  Let me know what rates you are looking at.  We didn't keep all of them updated and GRI changed effective 1/1/2002.  I did make some updates to this file.  Also, I only have rates for East Desk pipelines.
 
 

Chris,
 
Please let Yuana and Phil know if you have an updated file.

Robin is having back surgery next Thursday, Feb 28th.  She went to a neurosurgeon for a second opinion, Dr. Alfonso Aldama was her second opinion dude..  Dr. Esses, my second opinion dude, is an orthopedic surgeon.  And Dr.Alani, the guy I went to see first was an orthopedic surgeon.

Robin said I should go to a neurosurgeon.  What do you think?

I'm requesting the prepay for Dominion for March 2002.  I printed out the request, signed it, and gave it to Doug.  I just want everyone to be aware of what is happening with Dominion.  Dominion is still not delivering the gas to Tallahassee due to a Force Majeure event.  We are expecting gas to flow any day, hopefully by the weekend.

Eric, I left a message for David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion to call me about the prepayment amount.  Following are my calculations

Prepay for March 2002		10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422
Non deliveries for Feb 2002	10,000 dth per day x 14 days x $2.1562 = ($301,868)

				Estimated payment due 2/28/02	               $366,554

As of today Mops has been down from Feb 8th - 21st, 14 days.  Mops may not come up until the weekend or early next week.  I will adjust the prepayment as needed next week.
	

 

Tommy, I see you didn't approve my access for AEP which is fine.  I only need access to all the Estate desks and I just asked Daniel to give me everything because I don't know where the deals are for the other desk.  I didn't know if the Central Desk deals are under Central Desk or one of their many other books.  I think I just need Central, East, West, and Texas.

But, maybe you can help.  My request for the Central Desk needs Darron Giron's approval and he's not in the People Finder.  So he's either at UBS or he left the company.  Do you know who I should be approving that now?

Thanks

I don't have any letters that the producers have sent to Dominion, but I do have copies of  termination letters and release letters they sent to us.  I can fax you some samples - what is your fax number? 
 
At Dominion, I talked to Dan Baney, who knew only that they were requiring releases per their legal department.  
Dennis Bond is a more knowledgeable person at Dominion at 304-627-3566.
Their attorney handling this matter is Bill Savier at 304-627-3340.

Wade, 2 things, do you have any of the letters that the producers sent to Dominion, I would like one of those AND who are you talking to at Dominion?
 
Thanks
 
Shemin Proctor (an outside lawyer who is helping with gas contracts) will be looking in to this.  Sarah Bruck (Enron Legal Specialist) may have some documentation questions.  
 
Thanks,

Kay - Thanks for your attention and assistance in this matter. 

Several  gas producers are flowing gas through Dominion Transmission pipeline to Enron's pool.  They have terminated their contracts with Enron, or have sent documents to us to terminate their contracts with Enron. They are calling now requesting letters confirming termination of their contracts and/or letters releasing their gas on Dominion Transmission's pipe from Enron's pool in order to satisfy Dominion Transmission's requirement for proof of termination and/or release of gas back to the producers.  Dominion Transmission is holding these producers' gas and is not letting the producers sell their gas to other buyers.

I have been trying for the last three weeks to discover the route these requests need to pass through in order to get the aforementioned termination and release notices. I have met with little success and fewer answers. Prior to my being involved, Nelson Ferries had forwarded a few requests through Contracts and Legal and had Fred Lagrasta sign off on them.  I also talked to several people last week in Contracts and Legal asking for help, but a process does not seem to be in place.

Please advise as to how quickly we can act on these requests.  Producers are fearful of not being able to sell their January 2002 gas (ie. not getting paid) and are facing severe financial hardships.  Please advise as to what I can provide or help out with this process.

A list of producers is provided below.  I am sure more producers will call.

I see job #1154 (Origination - Wholesale) on the job posting board.  I am going to apply for it online (hopefully today).  I thought you said yesterday that there are two postings for your area.  Do you know if it has been posted yet or are you using job #1154 to fill both positions?

This is what I want to send to our "Team".  Would you please do a quick review just before I send it out?

These are my notes on the Sonat Park & Loan.  I have not spoken with any legal counsel representing ENA.

Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.

ENA recognizes a balance of 197,537 dth - the difference is ENA is not netting the 96,000 dth Loan with the park and Sonat is showing and additional day of withdrawal of 8,588 dth in January 2002.

Chris's notes:
Sonat Park & Loans

2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat 
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount went the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

I would like to have access to the following directory.  It has the actual Gas Daily prices loaded into excel files.  I'm not sure who you have to ask but they may not let me have it.  The directory is o:TDS/TDS Curve/East/

Let me know.

Thanks

I've requested a prepayment of $10,000.00 to be sent tomorrow and I have
that on my schedule.

You are most welcome.

I printed this out and gave it to Doug.  My revised prepay amount for Thur is $10,000.00.

 

I'm using March pricing for TCO and Sonat.  For TCO, I'm using the financial basis offer for March provided by Dan Junek at AES at 9:45 AM, $.125.  Sonat basis is not as liquid so I'm using the Inside Ferc differential for Feb 2002.  For Feb 2002, Henry Hub is $2.03 and Sonat is $1.99, ($.04).  At 10:00 AM, NYMX for March 2002 is $2.36

TCO Value	$2.485 = $2.36 + $.125

Sonat Value	$2.32 = $2.36 + ($.04)

I need Sitara access to all gas regions.  I'm trying to look at some of the Central Desk activity and I don't have authorization.  We might as well give me access to all ENA gas positions and the ability to create/update Sitara tickets for all gas regions.

I am requesting a payment to Dominion Oklahoma (aka Louis Dreyfus) in the amount of $10,334.67.  This payment is for gas that flowed in Feb 2002 to the City Of Tallahassee.  According to Max Doner, ENA billed Tallahassee for the incremental volumes and Tallahassee paid for the gas.

Doug, Drew, I am requesting the payment to be made on Monday, June 17th.  I will get the wire request from settlements, attach the supporting documents, get Ed's signature, and leave it with Susan.  I assume Susan will pass it on to one of you after she approves it.  Is that how the process works these days?

 

I'm moving into my new hugh apartment with my first roommate - have not had a roommate since March 1996.

Hey Guys!!

Joni is going to be in town this weekend and mentioned trying to get together with everyone on Saturday night.  Let me know if ya'll are going to be around or not.  Clarissa...I know you said you have a wedding this weekend,  but let me know if it's going to be an all night event. 

Thanks,
Meredith 

POINTY HEAD!!!!!!     I KNEW IT!  Poor little fella.

I like the apartment but the walk to the parking garage is terrible.  I don't think Immer is going to like it very well either when she's lugging the baby around.  Talk about space, I GOT IT!  For now anyway.  Yeah, I've emptied my car of certain items because I didn't want to carry them around.  Hey we need to discuss how to divy those up.  I've always wanted them even though I don't use them.  Dad gave me the single shot 12, but there is still the little one, the double (the prize possesion) and the new one that you wanted to use.

The apartment is still pretty empty.  I didn't want to empty my boxes until we got Immer's stuff in there.  I don't think she has that much either, living room furniture, bed, 2 bedroom night stands, armwour, kitchen talble, 1 stupid cat.....

 Did you remember that we put some items in your vehicle that you wanted me
to take home cause Ingrid is not to crazy about them.   I did not take
them, forgot.   Are they still in the back of your Explorer?   How's the
new apartment.   You about got it all set up.   Nice apartment.   I like
it.    Did not deposit the $125 in your account from the washing machine
sell.  Used $65 on changing the oil in the tractor and buying a grease gun
to lubricate the water pump.   Water pump still leaks so we I'll pull the
pump this weekend and send it off for repair.

We received a  letter from Chance.   Said they shaved his head and that his
head was pointy.

While it has been discouraging to see an endless stream of negative news coverage about Enron, we want you to know about some positive news that is starting to emerge.  ABC News was at Enron today because they want to do a story about Enron's future, our business going forward and the tremendous work being performed by the remaining 20,000 employees worldwide.  The segment is scheduled to appear on both Good Morning America and on ABC World News Tonight with Peter Jennings on Wednesday, Feb. 20.  The Good Morning America piece will be kicked off with a live feed from the Enron Building tomorrow morning at 7 a.m. CST.   Check local listings for the air time of World News Tonight.  While there is no guarantee that these stories will be glowing pieces about Enron, the interest by ABC in running a positive story is encouraging.  We wanted to let you know about these stories before they air.  

Additionally, two articles featuring interviews with Interim CEO Steve Cooper ran yesterday in USA Today and the Los Angeles Times.  We are forwarding them to you for your information.  Thank you for your support as we work to turn the tide of media coverage and public perception of Enron and its employees.

New Enron CEO turns company focus to future ; While workers cope with loss and uncertainty

(Copyright 2002)

HOUSTON -- Inside Enron headquarters, employees walk by stacks of moving boxes as they scrounge for pens and Post-it Notes from the empty desks of their laid-off co-workers. On one desk, an employee finds a note that reads: "I'm not gone, don't take my stuff!" 
Forgotten behind the headlines of smoking guns, Aspen ski homes and shredded documents are almost 18,000 employees who work on Enron's power plants and pipelines.
USA TODAY is the first to get a tour inside Enron since its collapse late last year and spend time with Stephen Cooper, the new chief executive, talking about his vision for the future. 
On the 50th floor of executive suites, decorated with rich carpets and velvet-covered chairs, there is a sweeping view of Houston -- a city Enron helped shape with its philanthropy, political donations and corporate muscle. Cooper, however, is only focused on saving part of the company. 
His plan faces monumental challenges. In his words, "Everybody's betting against us." 
While many American corporate icons have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the past year -- Kmart, Polaroid, Bethlehem Steel -- the size, speed and sordid details of Enron's collapse have sparked numerous investigations and lawsuits, angered creditors, demoralized employees and ruined its reputation. 
But Cooper -- whose firm Zolfo Cooper worked on the troubles of such companies as Polaroid, Sunbeam and Federated Department Stores - - is adamant Enron can emerge healthy from bankruptcy within a year. 
"I've probably been in more Chapter 11s than anybody in the United States, literally," he says. "This company, by way of business and asset base, by way of management team, by way of predictability of its future business, has more of all of that than most distressed businesses I've ever seen." 
Cooper's plans 
The company already has sold the energy-trading business that was once considered its crown jewel to UBS Warburg. Although a bankruptcy court and Enron's creditors must first approve any moves, Cooper's plans include: 
* Enron will likely have to give up this skyscraper for a "more modest habitat," Cooper says. 
* The company's new $100 million building across the street from headquarters also is for sale. 
* Even Enron's name blazoned across the top of the nearby Major League Baseball stadium is going to have to go. 
"Out of the ashes, there ought to be something everyone can be proud of a year, or two, or three from now," he says. 
Today, the company still has a pipeline network that stretches from Canada to California and from Texas to Florida. And Cooper is betting that business can power the light at the end of the tunnel. 
He wants to keep the North American and South American pipelines and power plants and sell or shut down the rest of the company's businesses, including its broadband network, water utilities and the like. 
That will mean cutting an additional 10% to 20% off Enron's payroll and returning the company to its natural gas pipeline roots of the 1980s. 
But to pull off his plan, Cooper must not only sway his critics, including giant Wall Street creditors, but also motivate thousands of devastated employees. 
"Cooper and (Enron President Jeff) McMahon have one of the toughest jobs in business to keep the people there and keep them motivated," says John Whitney, a turnaround expert and professor at Columbia University. 
To lock in 500 key executives, Enron offered $55 million in retention bonuses. Former Enron executives who went to UBS Warburg as part of the sale of the energy-trading business also pocketed multimillion-dollar payoffs. 
And Cooper's pay? 
The New York-based consulting firm Zolfo Cooper will receive $1.3 million a year, plus $1.2 million for each of the eight executives he brought with him to Houston. If Enron emerges from bankruptcy, Cooper's firm will get a $5 million fee. If Enron is liquidated, Cooper will get a fee agreed upon by the creditors and court, according to a filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York. 
Shattered morale 
Enron's fall from grace has shattered employee morale. 
"It's just so sad," says one current employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "On several floors, it looks like the rapture. It looks like people disappeared into space. They're just gone." 
This employee, just two years away from retirement, watched $160,000 in retirement savings shrink to zero with Enron's stock price. "Now I'm going to have to work as a greeter at Wal-Mart until I'm 90," the employee says. "It's gone. I just can't make it back." 
Jorge Garcia, a project controls manager laid off in December, says his friends still at Enron say, " 'You can tell if you'll be let go soon by your office accommodations. If you've been moved to a cubicle, you probably won't last long.' " 
That kind of stress takes its toll. 
Downstairs in the company gym, Kathy Kissner, a massage therapist, says that as the company fell apart, employees would call begging for any open appointment or even just five minutes between appointments. 
"I've lost 30 pounds in the last six months" from long hours and lack of sleep, says Mark Palmer, vice president of communications. 
Cooper knows his employees have been hurt financially and emotionally. It's the hardest part of his job. 
"When people are looking at the prospect of losing enormous amounts of money, they often times get heated. They get emotional and upset," he says. "It's never fun to be at the receiving end, but I've gotten used to it." 
Blast voice mail 
To motivate the employees, he is trying to focus them on future goals. "People have two choices: We can spend all of our time living in the past, which is a crazy way to spend your life. You can't change it. Or, we can begin to move beyond the disappointment and the upset and the loss, to focus on the future," he says. 
And he has opened up lines of communication. 
Once a week, he sends out a lengthy voice mail, telling employees what has happened during the past week, explaining management changes and timetables. 
When employees call or send him e-mail, he will go find them in the building to answer their questions. And next month, he will hold a meeting with all of the employees in Houston to explain the details of his strategy to bring the company out of bankruptcy. 
This kind of candid communication is essential, he says. 
"We are not trying to eliminate bad news. We are not trying to make it just good news. What we are trying to do is to eliminate uncertainty," he says. "People can live with either one of those, good or bad. What they can't live with is uncertainty." 
And while some still say Enron's future is uncertain, Cooper is certain of one thing: 
"The lives and reputations of 20,000 people shouldn't be trash- canned because a handful of geniuses decided to run wild," he says. "People ought to keep in perspective that we've got a lot of really tremendous people here, and for the sake of a couple bad apples, we shouldn't blowtorch the entire field."

The Nation Acting CEO Plans Legal Assault Amid Effort to Salvage Enron Litigation: Those who helped fell the energy giant would be targeted, Stephen Cooper says.

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. is planning a broad legal assault against those who helped bring the company down, according to acting Chief Executive Stephen Cooper, the corporate rescue artist who was selected three weeks ago to put the company back on the road to solvency. 
Cooper said in an interview that the litigation would be extensive and rapid, although he declined to identify specific targets.
"Enron may have causes of action against institutions and individuals that could represent a meaningful asset for the estate," said Cooper, a principal with Zolfo Cooper, a New York consulting firm that specializes in corporate restructuring. "I think you will see something sooner as opposed to later." 
The players were many in what has become a lurid corporate morality play, and all are potential defendants. 
Enron filed the largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy in U.S. history Dec. 2, following a series of damaging disclosures of questionable transactions with partnerships controlled by company employees. The nation's seventh-largest company collapsed less than seven weeks after it disclosed losses tied to the off-the-books partnerships, wiping out billions of dollars in investor wealth and more than 6,000 jobs. 
An internal investigation by three Enron directors determined that abuses in accounting of partnership transactions masked at least $1 billion in recent losses, while a few company employees reaped millions of dollars in personal profits. Directors and executives, including former Chairman Kenneth L. Lay and former Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling, failed to curb the missteps of subordinates, the report concluded. It also pointed to poor advice from Andersen, Enron's auditor, and Vinson & Elkins, one of its outside law firms. 
Still Sorting Out All the Issues 
Cooper, who occupies Skilling's old office on the 50th floor of Enron's mirrored office tower in downtown Houston, said the company has not asked any former employees to repay the millions of dollars they earned from partnership transactions. That would include former Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow, former Enron Global Finance executive Michael Kopper and former Treasurer Ben F. Glisan. 
"I think that the recovery vehicle in the main will be litigation," Cooper said. 
Cooper and his team are still "sorting out issues" related to Enron's financial statements and the value of its trading book, the contracts that were not included in the recent sale of its energy trading operation. Since Enron filed for Bankruptcy Court protection, the value of those contracts has eroded to about $1 billion from about $7 billion. 
"I certainly don't believe at this particular point in time that anybody is engaging in transactions that aren't completely above board," Cooper said. "We will be presenting to the creditors committee on a regular basis our financial statements, which I believe, in the main, will be accurate." Enron has not yet hired a new auditor to replace Andersen, which it fired. 
Enron already has filed a $10-billion lawsuit against Dynegy Inc. alleging that its cross-town rival withdrew from a proposed merger with Enron in late November as part of a plan to wreck the ailing company. Dynegy has said it pulled out of the merger because Enron misrepresented the depths of its financial problems and lost its investment-grade credit rating. 
The Enron that Cooper envisions will look much different from the market-dominating energy trader that Lay and Skilling built. The name will change, and the company will focus on its natural gas pipelines and power plants--the kind of hard assets Skilling said he disdained. 
Cooper's style, too, is unlike Lay's grandfatherly and professorial demeanor and Skilling's hard-driving image. Cooper insists on being called by his first name and dresses casually at the office, complete with baseball cap. He hasn't decorated Skilling's wood-paneled, deadbolted office. 
To keep up employee morale, Cooper said he visits workers in response to e-mail and sends out weekly, unscripted voicemail updates. An all-employee meeting will be held soon, he said. 
Enron's overhaul is well underway. 
Enron has agreed reluctantly to turn over to Dynegy its biggest pipeline, 16,500-mile Northern Natural Gas, which was a condition of the $1.5 billion that Dynegy invested in Enron as part of the aborted merger. Enron also recently gave away its vaunted energy-trading operation to New York investment banking firm UBS Warburg in a no-cash deal that would supply Enron with a cut of any future profit. 
What remains is an assortment of smaller natural gas pipelines, including one that runs from Texas to California, and electricity generating plants. Enron has announced plans to shut down its remaining telecommunications operations and to unload Portland General, its Oregon utility, as well as many of the international power plants and other assets whose poor performance helped sink the company. 
Cooper declined to detail which assets he is thinking of unloading because "we haven't settled on a final configuration yet. But it will be substantially smaller by way of reported revenue than the old Enron. 
"The company, if you remove the trading from the rest of the business, it's actually got a very good, very solid, very revenue- and cash-flow- and earnings-predictable business, which is really its power and pipes business," Cooper said. "So in my view, there is an eminently reorganizable entity here." 
'Not Going to Wallow and Linger' 
Cooper expects to present "a fairly on-point direction" for reorganization to its creditors committee in the second quarter and to have settled on a new version of the company within a year. 
"We're going to move this process forward very quickly. We're not going to wallow and linger in Chapter 11 for a day longer than we have to." 
Although many have speculated that Enron will never emerge from bankruptcy and will instead be carved up and sold, Cooper said he is "not of that mind," adding that in his 30-year career of reorganizing companies he has seen only a few instances in which liquidation made more sense for creditors than reorganizing the ongoing business. Those cases all involved substantial amounts of valuable real estate, he said. 
Enron has a bit of that. Although it leases its Houston headquarters, Enron is building a tower nearly as tall next door. It has received $40 million in debtor financing to complete and sell that project. 
Cooper flatly states that he is not interested in doing a post-mortem on Enron, but he did acknowledge the "very labor-intensive" process of sorting through "hundreds upon hundreds" of so-called special purpose entities, which are financial vehicles commonly used by corporations to finance projects separate from the company's balance sheet and for other legitimate purposes, such as a sale and lease-back of a building. 
Lawyers and accountants are examining the entities to determine the extent of Enron's liabilities and the economic value to Enron of each vehicle, he said. A team of about 10 Zolfo Cooper employees, an unusually large number, is being assigned to Enron, Cooper said. 
"There's a difference between were the partnerships legitimate or not versus were they accounted for properly or not. Both of these are being looked at. We'll just have to wait to see what the attorneys say as that gets sorted out," Cooper said. 
Special purpose entities "are not good or bad, they're just instruments or vehicles which provide companies with financial flexibility to better manage their business, to better manage their balance sheet to fit the needs of their business," Cooper said. 
"The Enron phenomenon was the failure to transfer economic risk [from Enron to the partnerships] and the failure to disclose and the suspension of the corporate code of ethics and conduct that allowed people to get into a position where they had divided loyalties" by working for both Enron and the partnerships, he said. 
"What we saw here was a case where they weren't constructed properly, they weren't reported properly and by allowing someone to be on both sides of the transaction, you couldn't have really an arm's-length transaction. It's kind of like having you negotiate both sides of a prenuptial agreement." 
Despite its size, the Enron reorganization is much like every other he has handled, Cooper said. Those included Federated Department Stores Inc., Polaroid Corp. and Malden Mills. 
Unique to Enron, however, is the furor surrounding the rapid and stunning collapse of the business, Cooper said. 
"It's become an enormous lightning rod for not only the upset of people directly involved in the company, but it's become a lightning rod to coalesce all of these other national interests" involving such issues as accounting and corporate governance, Cooper said. 
"I hope people will be able to relax and calm down and look at this as an opportunity for a fresh start for our external economic constituencies, a fresh start by way of an investment and a fresh start for our employees," Cooper said. 
"It's sort of like when your car breaks down and you're in the middle of nowhere and you end up hating the car. You're kicking the tires. You're kicking the bumpers. After you get over it, you realize that it's still a good car. You get the tire or whatever fixed and you just keep going."

Sonat Park & Loans

2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer at Sonat (205-326-2007)
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Dec 2001 or Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001 that ENA has not paid for.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).

This would be for gas ENA purchased from Sonat.  It's not transport related.

Rita,

I am told that Sonat indicates that we owe them at least $879,000 for October 2001. The values you provided do not indicate this large amount. Can you please verify and let me know.

Thanks, you too.  How do I get my fax number changed in the contract?  My current fax number is 713-646-3037.

THanks!  Have a nice day off!

ENA did not purchase any gas for the weekend or Tuesday (Monday is an
Enron holiday).

Have a good weekend!

 <<ENA-Reliant Prepay.xls>>

Max, would you provide Phl with the amount of money we expect to receive for the Tallahassee swing gas for May please?

Thanks.

Also, let Phil know if there are any reductions on the baseload amounts too.

thanks

Mr. G:

On COT, I have a good estimtae of our expected payment for the baseload quantity, but what about swing gas?

PP

Hi Max

Can you update Phil and Larry re the cash receipts expected from City of Tallahassee on the 25th. Has that invoice been finalized yet.

Margaret

 

ENA did not purchase any gas for the weekend or Tuesday (Monday is an Enron holiday).

Have a good weekend!

 

Any news on this?

Who would have this info?  And it might be a good thing for me to add to the schedule.

Thanks

Chris,

I would like to get a confirmation number from your treasury department once wires are sent.

Thanks,
Pete

Sorry about the email I just sent at 10:49 AM.  Attached is my new schedule reflecting no gas flow on the 9th and 10th.

 <<ENA-Reliant Prepay.xls>>

Congratulations.  Of course I won't be able to give you any more candy on valentine's day.  But maybe someone over there will take care of that.

All-

I just wanted to let everyone know that today will be my last day with Enron.  I have accepted a position with Duke Energy which should be a challenging and enriching experience.  I wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you to everyone who has helped me along the way while I've been here.  It's been a pleasure working with all of you.  Please feel free to contact me at this new email address: angiez_1@hotmail.com or call me anytime on my cell phone at 832.656.5948.

Best Regards-
Angie Zeman

Hey there.  I did get your message and yes we did wire $26,000.00 yesterday that is for a gas prepayment.  Pete sent me an email earlier this week asking for a confirmation number from our treasury department of the wires we make.  I like that idea and I'm still working on getting the info to add to my worksheet.

thanks.

Hello Chris,

Melissa in our Accounting Dept. left me a message that and even
$26,000.00 came in yesterday.  I wanted to check with you whether or not
it is a gas prepayment.  Please let me know at your earliest
convenience, and I will let her know.

Thanks,

Shawn

let me go buy some ammo.  let's see, which gun do i use?????

If I ever do understand, please shoot me.

You still don't understand how things work.  You are suppossed to always have that info at my beck and call.

Didn't my mom give us a few names back when you were having the disc
problem?  In fact, I thought you went to see one of them and you liked him.
I think he was the one who recommended that you hold off on surgery.	ii

Robin needs a back doctor recomendation.  Who do you think she should see?

Ok, since I have not seen or heard from you, I'm tossing you nameplate.  Maybe my woman will let me put it up in the bedroom, the one we are moving into on Monday. 

I've heard that there may be some job opportunities with Transwestern Pipeline.  They recently had an employee leave their marketing department.  I would like to talk to Kevin Hyatt and at least let him know that I may be interested in any future opportunities.  Would that be ok with you?

What's the status of my nephew?  Is he in Chicago?  Has he gone awol yet?

 

A variation of a folkloric explanation of economic systems

FEUDALISM: You have two cows. Your lord takes some of the milk.

FASCISM: You have two cows. The government takes both, hires you to take
care of them, and sells you the milk.

COMMUNISM: You have two cows. Your neighbors help take care of them and you
share the milk.

TOTALITARIANISM: You have two cows. The government takes both and denies
they ever existed and drafts you into the army. Milk is banned.

CAPITALISM: You have two cows. You sell one and buy a bull. Your herd
multiplies, and the economy grows. You sell them and retire on the income.

ENRON VENTURE CAPITALISM: You have two cows. You sell three of them to your
publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your
brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap with an
associated general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax
exemption for five cows. The milk rights of the six cows are transferred
via
an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority
shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed
company. The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option
on one more.

P.S. When the sham is finally uncovered, you and the other executives
siphon
off all the companies assets, freeze the assets of the peons working on the
farm, and then tell them that there is no use crying over spilled milk.

I do know him and I just left him a note to call you.

I'm trying to get in touch with Gerald Gilbert.  He started working
there on 2/1 I think.  You may not know him but if you do, ask him to
call me at 713-853-4743.

Good idea.  I'm checking on it and I might add this info to the worksheet.

Chris,

I would like to get a confirmation number from your treasury department once wires are sent.

Hey team.  

I would like to release the Iroq and Tenn capacity for March activity to Boston Gas by the end of the week if possible.  Please let me know by Thur morning if I should wait until next week.

Thanks

Steve Stonestreet at CGAS did verify that metered production on CGAS is "attached" to the AS (aggregation service) contracts, and from there you would schedule it to a transport contract or into the IPP contract.  CGAS and Dominion work very similar when talking about metered production.

37147	IPP agreement - our pooling contract.
39149  AS agreement - 
66917  AS agreement - 

I think the AS agreements are aggregation supply and I believe the wellhead meters were attached to these contracts to help with allocations and billing.  I not 100% sure so I left a message for our CGAS contact to verify.

Chris,

I am working on a project and I need a little help.  Do you know if the following contracts on TCO are pooling or transport?

Guess what?  I just hired some mover to move me next week.  Indrid keep telling me that you and I have bad backs and don't need to fool with moving furniture.  So, I hired movers.  They are charging me $60 hour and I figure 3 hours max.

Hopefully just once a week, every Thursday.

Yes, I would like to be added.  Do we prepay once a week for this?

Sylvia

Let me know if you want to be added to this distribution list.  I should only send this list out 2 or 3 times a week now that we have a process down.

That would be great if you could tell me.  I show we wired $22,500.00 at 12:00 PM on the 6th, and we should have wired $20,000.00 around 3:30 PM on the 8th.  I would be happy to include you on the schedule below that I email to Jim and Pete showing this activity.  Let me know.  You might let your accounting department know that we plan on wiring money to Reliant every Thursday, enough money to cover supply for the next 7 days.

 

Just wanted to double check the amount.  Accounting is telling me they
received a wire the 6th, and I want to make sure the amount they are
telling me is what you sent.

Thanks!

Hey!  Congradulations on getting that new phone number.  I knew you could do it.  Would you ask Gerald Gilbert to call me when he gets a chance?  My number is 713-853-4743.

To All,
 
My bosses have been impressed with me so far, and for that gave me a phone, my new work number is 713-371-8581.

Greg at Dominion
Calvin at Select
Greg Hood at Oxy
Steve at BP

The only person I had to leave a voicemail for is Grier at El Paso.  His number is 713-420-5673.  You may have already touched base with him.  If not, you may want to call him on Monday, I will be out.

later

I'm out Monday, Feb 11th.  I'm just cleaning up my apartment, getting ready for the big move.  My pager number is 877-498-5497 if anyone needs me or JUST WANTS TO TALK.  Do not leave a voicemail on my pager like Eric does, I don't have the code to check voicemails.

Robin Barbe will talk to Jim Taylor at Reliant on Monday.  Jim Taylor's number is 713-207-1482.  We should have enough money at Reliant to cover purchases through Friday of next week.

Robin, Christina will let you know if Tallahassee calls on the gas.

I adjusted my schedule to reflect higher prices and the wire scheduled to go out at 3:30 PM today.

Did I mention what wonderful people we have working in settlements?  WELL THEY ARE!!!!

Thanks TEAM.

I'm working on my contact list.  It looks like I'll have better luck after lunch.  FP&L asked me to call back after lunch.  Judy said that Scott Neal just doesn't want to talk about it till after trading.

Interesting note (and I'm keeping track of my notes)  AEP will not buy gas from Enron.  I spoke to Elsa Villarreal (works for Houston Pipeline).  She called Todd Lambert in her Columbus office and Todd told Elsa that AEP will not buy gas from Enron.

I'll keep you guys posted on my Bridgeline notes through out the day.

Jim
Attached is my worksheet showing our daily activity and prepayments.  I would like to send this worksheet to you 2 or 3 times a week.
Let me know if you agree with all the information.  We can also change the format.  I will be out of the office on Monday so Robin Barbe will be calling you.  Her number is 713-853-7177.

Also, we originally intended to wire more money to Reliant on Monday but we are trying to wire the money today due to the increase in prices.  I will keep you posted and I will update the schedule for any prepayments made today.

Tallahassee called on the gas for the weekend.  I had planned for that in my numbers but I had no idea prices would go up $.07 - $.11 for the weekend - my fault.  This makes my cash balance at Reliant short by about $130.00 if prices post on the high side.  My trading contact at Reliant said that his credit department DOES NOT want to work with us at all.  My contact said his credit department could force him to cut the deal.  We won't know until this afternoon or Monday.  So please try to get the wire out today.

Thanks

 

I've would like to wire Reliant $9,500.00 tomorrow and then wire about $31,000.00 every Thursday to keep Reliant paid for 7 days of gas.  I'm making the following assumptions;
	1.  ENA will be maintaining this deal through March 31, 2002
	2.  Prices are going to remain flat for the next 2 months
	3.  Tallahassee will call on the maximum swing volumes every day

So far this month, Tallahassee has called on the maximum swing volumes every day.  I will make adjustments to the Thursday wire amount as needed based on prices and how much Tallahassee calls on.

The following worksheet projects how much we need to send Reliant each week and shows what days Tallahassee called on the swing gas.  Phil, you mentioned adding a column for the sales price to Tallahassee.  Sounds good to me.  This file is located at o:/Gas Structuring/Bankruptcy Folder/City of Tallahassee/Tallahassee Swing Cash Flow.xls

 

The following worksheet shows ENA's activity with Reliant, our current cash balance with Reliant, how much gas we have purchased, and what price we used.
I will send the following worksheet to Reliant each week.  I also plan to copy Phil, Robin, and Margaret.  This file is located at o:/Gas Structuring/Bankruptcy Folder/City of Tallahassee/ENA-Reliant Prepay.xls

 

Eric, Doug, Phil,   let me know what you think about the wire for Friday and every Thursday.

I echatted with Dan.  He said the number is 212-398-6300 and HE THINKS the name of the person is Allen Fuchs.

Tennessee requires a pepayment or LC in the amount of $25,000.00 per SA pool.  For the Keyspan deal, that essentially means we would need $25,000.00 of credit for each point, 500L, 800L, and Zone 0 = $75,000.00 total.

These are my notes on flowing gas.  Tetco will be the problem pipeline.  I called my rep again and asked her to seriously look into it.  I'm thinking worse case is they will need either cash or a letter of credit for about $1,000,000.00.  I'm using the following formula

	MDQ (22,000 dth) x 20 days x $ some cashout price 

They may cut back on the number of days but the cashout price is the problem.  It's a moving target and I expect prices to go up.  I think that if we just agreed to give them a letter of credit for $1 mill and then prepay for any actual expenses we incur, we could build our reputation on the pipeline, at least until we get rid of these deals.  If all the gas flows like it should, we should never have any actual expenses on any of these pipelines for the Keyspan deal.

Who knows what volumes are going to be?

I have released the Boston Gas capacity on Tennessee, contract 29667, and Iroquois, contract 1250-08, to Boston Gas, non-recallable, subject to bid (per Boston Gas's request), for Feb 1st for one month only.

Other transport notes;

To serve the Lilco deal, we need supply on Texas Eastern, Tennessee, and Transco.

Texas Eastern is trying to decide how to handle the cash out exposure.  There is no commodity expense on the type of agreement I am requesting but there is the possibility of cash out.  I think the exposure to Texas Eastern is minimal and it could be that Texas Eastern just wants to be difficult to work with.

We can still flow gas on our Tennessee pooling contract.

We need an IT contract on Transco.  Transco requires a prepayment or a letter of credit using the following formula, MDQ x 90 days x max it rate from Zone 1 to Zone 6 ($.5169).  I believe the Lilco volume on Transco is about 21,000 dth/day.  Therefore, we would need to give Transco a letter of credit for about $977,000.00.

I also believe that we could do a buy/sale on Transco and Texas Eastern and bypass the pooling process.

Donna, Victor,
I like to keep scheduling informed of all activity on my pipes.  I plan on copying Ruth, Kathy, Maria, and Kim on my emails.  Who should I include from scheduling?

Thanks

Wade called Eric about someone wanting us to cancel a contract then Wade said there are still lots of producers putting gas on our contracts.  I was working on something else and I just asked Wade to send me a worksheet of what he was talking about.  Wade actually called Eric.

I've actually done a lot of things for him and Sherry concerning that very subject.  Why are you asking?  Did you get a call or something?

Do you want to work with Wade Price on the Appalachian suppliers on CGAS?  I think we are still getting gas because contracts have not been terminated or something like that.  It will probably be tedious but it doesn't matter to me.  Just let me know.

Notice to all Dominion Transmission shippers:

In an effort to better accommodate the needs of our PL-1 customers we have
rescheduled the pigging work that was scheduled for Wednesday June 12,
2002, to Friday, June 14, 2002.  This notice replaces all other notices
that were posted on DTI's EBB with regard to this issue.  The
implementation of this restriction on Friday at 10:00 a.m. ECT (9:00 CCT),
means that there will be no interruptible transportation capacity or
non-PL1 transportation capacity available along the PL-1 system.  This
restriction will also require that all deliveries at that time on the PL-1
system be made to their primary delivery point.  All interruptible and
secondary deliveries along the PL-1 system will be reduced to zero
effective for the gas day of June 14, 2002, at 10:00 ECT (9:00 CCT).
Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Iroquois is offering to market ENA's capacity for $1.00 (see attachements at the bottom of this email).  Doesn't sound like a bad deal to me 

Chris

I checked our tariff and with our in house council and there is nothing that
precludes us from assisting you with marketing this capacity.  In fact, our
tariff provides for it in Section 28.15 of the General Terms & Conditions
(Transporter & Shipper negotiate a "marketing fee" for Transporter to
actively market capacity on behalf of Shipper).  So as not to set a
precedent of doing it for free, I've attached a letter agreement for a token
$1 marketing fee.  What is the protocol (and likelihood) of having something
like this signed?

Once the capacity is offered and a replacement shipper is found, all three
parties would sign a permanent release agreement, a pro forma of which is
also attached.  Basically it outlines who the parties are, what agreements
are in place, and takes all the liability (and right of first refusal) off
of you and puts it on the Replacement Shipper.  Enron has signed a similar
agreement in the past regarding the majority of volumes on the same contract
when it released them to ProGas in 1997.

Please call me to discuss and/or if you need the relevant tariff page faxed
to you.

Roses are red.
Violets are blue.
You're a pain in the ass,
But I s'pose I am, too.

So oft when we meet,
We fuss and we fight.
It becomes hard to see
That we share a love of great might.

But no matter the tears,
Or gut wrenching fears.
As we grow old,
We create a togetherness,
Lovely to behold.

Look what I found in my inbox.

Chris,
I believe Hector Alatorre has told you about the letter of credit that is
needed.  I have attached the format for Transco.  If you have any questions

We need an IT contract on Transco.  Transco requires a prepayment or a letter of credit using the following formula, MDQ x 90 days x max it rate from Zone 1 to Zone 6 ($.5169).  I believe the Lilco volume on Transco is about 21,000 dth/day.  Therefore, we would need to give Transco a letter of credit for about $977,000.00.

I also believe that we could do a buy/sale on Transco and Texas Eastern and bypass the pooling process.

Donna, Victor,
I like to keep scheduling informed of all activity on my pipes.  I plan on copying Ruth, Kathy, Maria, and Kim on my emails.  Who should I include from scheduling?

Thanks

Same thing as yesterday.  I requested a wire in the amount of 244.20 (2000 dth x $.1221 per dth) which is for gas flow on ENA's IT contract #2891 on 2/6/02.  I negotiated this deal with Michelle in the bid room.  You should have received this yesterday afternoon.

Thanks
chris

Ted, thanks for your help on the account number.  I have requested a wire in the amount of $244.20 (2000 dth x $.1221 per dth) which is for gas flow on ENA's IT contract #2891 on 2/5/02.  This is a negotiated IT deal that I did with Bob Fleming in the Bid Room.

Please call me at 713-853-4743 if you have any questions.

Thanks

Maragaret,
I have 2 prepays in this email.  We will not need to wire money to Tennessee if we can get TXU set up as a supplier by 8:40 AM tomorrow.

Note to all
The first prepay is to TXU.  I'm requesting $22,500.00 to be prepaid to TXU - that's about 5 days of supply for the Tallahassee deal.

The second prepay is for 1 day of interruptible transportation on Tennessee.  If we are unable to purchase gas from TXU or Reliant, we will use the Bear Creek storage gas on Tennessee to supply the Tallahassee deal.  This is what we did on the 2nd-6th.  I am also anticipating that the discounted IT rate on Tennessee will be higher for gas flow on the 7th.

My goal is to maintain 2 active suppliers (with prepays) on the East Coast, TXU and Reliant.  I would also like to set up a trading contract with another supplier (maybe Coral) in case TXU or Reliant decides to stop doing business with ENA.  Our supplier for the swing gas on the Tallahassee deal in January was Sequent.  However, last Thursday, Sequent stopped doing business with ENA because it was too much of a burden for them to keep track of the ENA prepays and the daily volumes.  So far we have spent 3 business days trying to secure another supplier.  We will also be able to use TXU and Reliant as suppliers for any other deals that we are able to start up.  

 

 

hey, i thought you were out of the office.

Outstanding!!!

I sold 10,000 dth to TXU for 6/11/02 at GD Waha flat.

I thought yesterday was going to be our last day but now I think today is it.  This has turned out to be very frustrating

chris,
are we going to be doing this prepay the rest of the month?

Kim

Another prepay to Tennessee.  The calculation for the prepay is 2,000 dth x $.1221 per dth = $244.20.

Reliant has indicated that we must use their paper - this point is non-negotiable.

Kay, we will not wire any funds to Reliant until we have your approval of the contract.  I understand that you are also working on a gas contract with TXU.  We need one of these contracts in place so we can buy gas tomorrow morning, it doesn't matter which contract we have in place first.

Doug, Phil, Eric,
The prepayment that we were going to send to Reliant may be going to TXU instead.  We are coming dangerously close to defaulting on the Tallahassee contract.  Robin and I are going to work on a prepayment request for TXU after lunch.

I just got to work about 10 min ago.  Key Lay has resigned from the Board of Directors.  I brought in those chocolate hearts and passed them out to my little group.  I told the guys that I DO discriminate because I gave all the guys 1 chocolate and all the girls 2 chocolates.

How's your day?

Richard James Taylor was born on Jan 15th.  He weighed 7 lbs 11 ozs.  Jim would like to meet for lunch, HIS TREAT, one day.  Of course he doesn't want to meet me, he wants to see Judy P.  But the boy is smart, he knows that the best way to see Judy P. for lunch is to invite me.  See there, you are still a benefit to me.  So how about Thursday?

Reliant has agreed to sell us gas on Florida.  My trading contact is Jim Taylor (713-207-1482).  The contact on the wire should be Pete Torres (713-207-1471), he is in Reliant's credit department.  Pete said there should be an active GISB contract with Reliant already in place.  I would like to prepay for 5 days and I have my calculation on the prepay request form. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

 

Same as before.  We should have another supplier set up by the end of the day.  The calculation for the prepay is 2000 dth x $.1221 per dth = $244.20 for gas flow on 2/5/02 on Tenn contract 2891.

The person I negotiated the deal with is Andy Armstrong, his number is 832-676-5120.
The person at El Paso Corporate Credit (Tennessee is a sub of El Paso) is Julie Baker, her number is 713-420-7446.

Eric,  Julie at El Paso said the only reason she is requiring a prepay for this small an amount is because her records show that ENA has not paid any monies for anything on the El Paso pipelines, including Tennessee, Sonat, ANR, or El Paso Pipeline.  I know that we should have at least paid for the Bear Creek storage on Tennessee.

Here's what I've got, but it doesn't include Pipeline Reps.

 

Update on a new swing supplier as of 4:00 PM on Friday

I've called PanCanadian, e prime, Cinergy, Reliant, Coral, ONEOK, and Entergy-Koch.  I'm waiting for most of these people to call me back.  The only positive response I've had is from Coral and he still doesn't know if he can sell us gas even if we prepay.  ONEOK is the only counterparty that said they will NOT do business with us because we owe them $40 million.

Today we learned that Bridgeline sent comfort letters to their customers, informing their customers that Bridgeline will NOT sell us gas.

Margaret, it looks like Monday may be another fire drill day but I promise to keep working on it until 1) I have two suppliers that will work with ENA or 2) I've run out of customers to call. 

Nothing so far.  Joe Parks is checking with Bridgeline to see if we can buy gas from them.  It was late in the day before PanCanadian called.  I don't think PanCanadian will work because they do not have the flexibility to sell different daily volumes over weekends and holidays.

I hope we can work out a deal with Bridgeline.  Joe or I will be calling them first thing this morning.  

Yesterday afternoon Tallahassee indicated that they may not need the swing gas for the weekend. 

What did you get worked out?

Update:  ENA was buying daily swing gas from Sequent on Florida to supply the City of Tallahassee deal.  Sequent says this deal is an administrative burden and has elected not to supply any more gas to ENA after 2/1/2002.  Scott Goodell called Aaron Bohall with PanCanadian to see if they would become our new swing supplier.  Aaron told me that they would sell us gas under the following conditions, 
	the deal has to be on PanCanadian's paper
	we need to let PanCanadian know by 8:00 AM every morning
	and ENA must take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays.

This is a problem because Tallahassee does not have to take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays and Tallahassee does not need to notify ENA until 9:00 AM.  Aaron will see if they can work with a 9:00 AM deadline.

Who do I talk to over there about buying gas on Florida in Zone 2?

And it was very nice to see you today.

I signed us up for the 6-week class.  The first class is Wed, Feb 20, 7-9.

ok, I see Russel and Chucks touch all through this.

Roses are red.
Violets are blue.
You're a pain in the ass,
But I s'pose I am, too.

So oft when we meet,
We fuss and we fight.
It becomes hard to see
That we share a love of great might.

But no matter the tears,
Or gut wrenching fears.
As we grow old,
We create a togetherness,
Lovely to behold.

Interesting because this capacity was released non-recallable to CES which was assigned (not via capacity release) to ENA.  

FYI, 

	demand charge =  $2.6614 per month    = $.0875 per dth 
	and the commodity is			$.0136
	Fuel =  2.902 % and at $2.10 = 		$.0628

	100% load factor cost = 			$.1639

can nisource do this, and do we care?

kim
As far as I know, ENA is not using any transport on Columbia Gas or Gulf.  If NiSource wants to recall, I do not believe it will create a problem.
Kim Olinger is coordinating all the Logistics activities for the wholesale desk.   (Kim...would you please confirm....).

It's important to note, that if ENA wants to keep this capacity, they must pay in full the outstanding indebtedness, together with accrued interest at the Commission approved interest rate, and furnish adequate assurance of payment to Releasor if required by the Releasor w/n 24 hours of being notified.
Since this message was not received from Nisource until 3:08 p.m. 1/31/02........ officially, Nisource can not recall the capacity until the evening cycle of 2/1/02.

I do want you to know that EES is actively nominating on Columbia Gas Transmission to the Columbia Gas of Ohio and PA markets.  If we receive any notice
of capacity recall on EES capacity, we will want to react and it will be critical to communicate this notification to me ASAP.

Thanks Rita!!

Donna,

I mentioned this to Bob on yesterday and he said to forward this to you.  We have not made any payments since we filed bankruptcy for pre or post petition activity at the direction of management.  When I spoke with the guy on yesterday, we agreed exactly on one of the invoices for around $80K, but he was supposed to get me the other contract number and amount since there are supposedly two outstanding invoices.  Please let me know how we need to handle this.

Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. has an existing capacity release to Enron North
America for 30,000 Dth per day. This release of Columbia Gulf FTS-1
capacity has a term expiring on March 31, 2002.

It is our understanding that Enron has not paid Columbia Gulf the November
2001 payment or the December 2001 payment. Since Enron has defaulted on its
post petition payment and Columbia Gas of Ohio is ultimately responsible
for payment to Columbia Gulf, pursuant to the Columbia Gulf tariff,
Columbia Gas of Ohio has the right to recall the capacity upon 24 hours
notice.

Columbia Gas of Ohio hereby gives notice to Enron that unless payment is
made to Columbia Gulf by 5:00 pm on Friday, February 1, 2002 by wire
transfer, Columbia Gas of Ohio will recall the capacity effective Tuesday,
February 5, 2002.

If you would like to discuss this matter, please give me a call at
telephone number 614-460-4996.

Hey team.  I had every intention of being there this morning (even though I was running late) but my daughter was awake and  I couldn't resist spending time with her.  I'll be there next week. 

Guys,
Joe informed me he cannot attend tomorrow AM and I'm assuming Chris is out until further notice.
Scott and Lindsey - please let me know if you plan to attend.  I'm inclined to go ahead if you both can make it, or cancel if one of you cannot.

Thx!

I think this will do for now.  I was sniffling the other evening when we went out for a little drinky and Meredith said you wanted to work out instead of seeing me.  I was so sad and heartbroken.  Baby's doing good.  Woman has not had any problems so far and she's starting to feel the baby move on a regular basis now.  I've never felt the little sucker move - maybe she's just getting fat.  What do you think?

I asked Victor about the files.  I think keeping it on your h drive is still a good idea for now.

The directory we(east desk logistics) would like moved(copied) for the new company is O:\common\logistics\gas\eastdesk. THANKS

Another thought is to simply copy all of your files onto the new directory if you prefer to do it that way. THANKS

Team, Please move all the files you need to do your jobs ( Phone lists, ID's, spreadsheets, anything) to O:\common\logistics\gas\eastdesk directory.  A copy of this will be made to conduct business in New Company....THANKS

Oh yeah, whatever you want deal.  I am completly indifferent.  Whatever makes you happy.

the 4-week (not so good cuz it ends awfully close to our due date); and Feb
20 - Mar 25 for the 6-week (this one meets 7-9 on Wed nites).

What are your thoughts?

I'm at my new desk on the 4th floor.  I'm here, my computer is here, but it looks like my phone has not been activated.  So I don't know when I'll be able to call and aggravate you.  Email aggravations just aren't the same.

Please try to think of some of our old conversations, especially those where you would look up and to the left uttering "oh my GOD!".

(See attached file: Ponderosa Pine Est Imbalance0602.xls)

Oh girl I know I do.  I'm very modest too.

let me tell you that you ROCK
Guess what.  I have the deal numbers in my notebook packed in  a box - but Ed McMichael said we are not going to flow this gas until March.  I think he also said he is trying to resurrect the Con Ed deal - which is probably similar to the Lilco deal with respect to the pipelines it flows on.

Transco does not have a pooling contract like many of the other pipelines on the East.  They assign the shipper a specific meter for that pool and you use your IT contract to nominate pool to pool stuff.  

I DID NOT CHANGE THAT OL CAPACITY TICKET BUT I THINK I WILL.  I'VE GOT TIME!!!!!!!!!

chrissy,
what is the lilco deal you are referring to?  are we currently noming this?  can't find anything in unify that shows that we are.  

what deal on transco would you need an it contract for?  

also, did you go and change the capacty ticket to reflect the release of capacty?  I'm not sure how to reflect it, but the ticket numbers
are 1190900, and 1190720.  I can do this for you if you tell me how it should be reflected.

I have released the Boston Gas capacity on Tennessee, contract 29667, and Iroquois, contract 1250-08, to Boston Gas, non-recallable, subject to bid (per Boston Gas's request), for Feb 1st for one month only.

Other transport notes;

To serve the Lilco deal, we need supply on Texas Eastern, Tennessee, and Transco.

Texas Eastern is trying to decide how to handle the cash out exposure.  There is no commodity expense on the type of agreement I am requesting but there is the possibility of cash out.  I think the exposure to Texas Eastern is minimal and it could be that Texas Eastern just wants to be difficult to work with.

We can still flow gas on our Tennessee pooling contract.

We need an IT contract on Transco.  Transco requires a prepayment or a letter of credit using the following formula, MDQ x 90 days x max it rate from Zone 1 to Zone 6 ($.5169).  I believe the Lilco volume on Transco is about 21,000 dth/day.  Therefore, we would need to give Transco a letter of credit for about $977,000.00.

I also believe that we could do a buy/sale on Transco and Texas Eastern and bypass the pooling process.

Donna, Victor,
I like to keep scheduling informed of all activity on my pipes.  I plan on copying Ruth, Kathy, Maria, and Kim on my emails.  Who should I include from scheduling?

Thanks

I wonder if you guys can attend these sessions as UBS?

Enron employees may find the current circumstances stressful.  We want to remind you that Enron's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is still available and currently offering services to assist you and your family.

Group Discussions                                                                                                                                                 
Beginning this week, Enron's EAP provider, Innovative Resources Group, will be facilitating group discussions for employees who are interested in attending. These sessions are designed to address the challenges employees may be facing and to suggest ways to minimize the impact of stress on employees and their families. These sessions will be held on Wednesday, January 30 and Thursday, January 31 at the following times in EB32C2:
	
	9:00 am -- 10:00 am
	11:00 am -- 12:00 pm

Ed has signed off on the agreement you gave me yesterday evening.  Should I send this straight to Boston Gas's outside counsel or should I send it to Melanie Gray?

Chris: 
Per our conversation a few minutes ago, attached please find the revised Stipulation.  This document has been modified with the changes that were in the mark-up you faxed to Toni Donohue here a few hours ago.  I also deleted "subject to recall" based on our discussion, assuming you get approval for that revision.  You informed me that you would discuss this with your attorney.
Also, as I mentioned to you, we have faxed your mark-up to Melanie Gray at Weil Gotschal in Houston to keep her informed.  (Her voice mail says she's out of the office until Monday.)
Thanks for all your help on this.

FYI - We just posted the capacity release to Boston Gas.  I created a biddable offer per Boston Gas's request.  This deal is for the month of Feb only.

I think so.  Probably some people in satellite offices too.  I heard it was mostly originators and middle marketers.

I didn't hear a word about it. Was it the marketing company?

I heard that El Paso had cuts on Friday.  Did that impact you guys at all?

I just validated and saved this release to Boston Gas.  Since I have not done this in awhile, would you please make sure I did the following things?

Released 100% of the volume biddable to Boston Gas and max rate.

I will wait to hear from you before I submit my offer.

Thanks.

OK, I never get to talk to Ruth because SHE IS ALWAYS ON THE PHONE.  And I bet she's on the phone with Shemin too!!!

Should we all get together and make a conference call to Dominion like we did before or should I just call Jeff Davis myself?  Our last call was Iris Kind, Bill Savier(sp?), and Jeff Davis.

Don't forget about me.  I'm still trying to find out what it will take to move gas on and ENA tabs agreement.  No transportation at this point, just a tabs.  Also, it will be much easier for you guys to monitor because most of the deals will be monthly.

Steve, everything looks good with one exception.  The rate schedule on Tennessee should be either NET-2 or NET-284.  I won't find out until Monday.  You review and approve it, keep it on your desk, and I will come over and make the change at your desk on Monday.  Then I'll take it to Ed for his approval.

By the way, Cullen and Dykman is sending copies of what we are doing to Melanie Gray.

Chris: 
Per our conversation a few minutes ago, attached please find the revised Stipulation.  This document has been modified with the changes that were in the mark-up you faxed to Toni Donohue here a few hours ago.  I also deleted "subject to recall" based on our discussion, assuming you get approval for that revision.  You informed me that you would discuss this with your attorney.
Also, as I mentioned to you, we have faxed your mark-up to Melanie Gray at Weil Gotschal in Houston to keep her informed.  (Her voice mail says she's out of the office until Monday.)

A heartwarming story of the advances of women in achieving equality throughout the world.  Barbara Walters did a story on gender roles in Kuwait several years before the Gulf War.  She noted then that women customarily walked about 10 feet behind their husbands.  She returned to Kuwait recently and observed that the men now walked several yards behind their wives.  Ms. Walters approached one of the women and said, "This is marvelous.  Can you tell the free world just what enabled women here to achieve this reversal of roles?"

"Land mines," said the Kuwaiti woman.

Cullen and Dykman (attorneys for Boston Gas Company) approved all of our changes on the agreement to release the Tenn and Iroq space back to Boston Gas.  They also made one other change, they are taking out the "subject to recall" language at the bottom of page 2 under item #1.

They will be sending the revised document to me.  I will deliver it to you for your approval.

Maybe we can go drinking too.  That would be fun.  I'll be at your house around 10:30 or 11 tonight.

Chris,
I left a message with our Credit folks, but I'm not sure how long it will
take to get a response.  Both the manager and the main person we work with
in that group are out today.  The manager's voice message said he'd be in
the ofc tomorrow.

Hector,
Chris called today to ask what we would require from Enron so that they
could set up an IT contract on which they would do only pool-to-pool
transfers, with volumes up to 40,000 dt/day.  Since we can't stop shippers
from doing billable transactions on IT contracts, I assume credit will still
require some sort of financial backing, such as cash up front.  I left a
message for Ken Newberry, but it doesn't look like I'll hear back from him
before I leave today.  Please follow up with Ken this afternoon if you have
time or with Leldon tomorrow.

Chris' number is 713-853-4743

Hector's number is 713-215-4256.

Thank you.	ii

Hey buddy.  I'm looking for a Boston Gas contract and I thought you might have a copy of it.  Its the involving 35,000 dth of transport on Iroq and Tenn.  Don't look to hard for it but if you do have it, just let me know and I'll come make a copy.

Thanks

I've already gone through Maureen's desk and she didn't have a copy.

Grier Martin with El Paso Merchant Energy called - he's interested in the Trailblazer capacity.  His number is 713-420-5673.

My ICE id and password no longer work.  They worked on Dec 26th.  Does yours still work?

FYI

Per Mark Ellenberg, there is no need to do anything at this stage.  Just let them expire and they'll be considered unsecured claims.

Steve

We have two firm transportation agreements on Tennessee Pipeline.  The long term Boston Gas capacity release and a short term contract which expires on 1/31/2002.  The monthly demand charge on the short term capacity is $15,200.00.

Do we need to reject the short term capacity before it expires?  To my knowledge, we did not flow any gas on this contract for December or January.

The person at Select Nat Gas interested in the Trailblazer capacity is Calvin Schultz, phone number 303-797-3388.

are you on a conference call with ruth and mark?

Here is a picture of my pregnant woman on the net.  I'll being adding more pictures this week.  Make sure you scroll down and read the comments at the bottom.

And to buy my g.d. ring?

My contact at Tennessee, Sherry Noack, said she doesn't see any problem with us releasing the Tenn Boston Gas capacity.  

Iroq pretty much said the same thing last week but I will verify that again after lunch.

Lunch on Friday sounds great.

Looks like I'll be walking over again today without my buddy.  He works for Northern and he's waiting for a termination letter from Enron and an offer letter from Dynegy.

Maybe I'll see you there!!!   A fellow can always hope.  Indrid still hasn't got me a rind either.  I bet she doesn't marry me now.

I'm an estate person.  Nobody at UBS wants me.

What is your status?

cmm

Do you have the file sharing set up yet?  And there is one contract on the East Desk that expires 1/31/2002 that we will need to turn back very soon I guess.

Opps, he's UBS too.

What about Rob Alwein?  

He is officially a scheduler now.  This is how the East Desk fared.

Guess what?  I have you nameplate.  I'm gonna take it home and cherish it forever.

I'm trying hard not to call you and use up my phone call allowance this morning.  GOOD NEWS.  I'm reading an article on Yahoo and they use the word nebulous.

Enron is, in part, the deformed offspring of a move to deregulate markets. It played fast and loose in a nebulous world of finance that received scant attention from lawmakers.

I know what it means.  And this is only the second time I have ever seen this word used!!!!!!!

Thanks.  I think Susan Weison has been all over.  

Hey, just wanted to give you a heads up......we had an EES employee meeting this afternoon.  Christi Finelli (our contract lady) said she got a call from Heidi Griffith and they they being Heidi & Jim Javins) were wanting to know if you were still here or not.  Not sure if they were asking because of a job opportunity they might have for you or if it was out of concern but I just wanted to let you know.  They are both with AES now, same place where Susan Weison ended up.  

This is very interesting.  It doesn't sound legal unless SIGCORP agreed to pay for November upfront.  

Thanks for the info.

I spoke again this morning to Pamela Brumbaugh at Texas Gas Transmission about contract #T018176.       This contract was acquired by capacity release from SIGCORP ENERGY.    Since ENA failed to pay the bill for November 2001 production,   then TGT's tariff allows them to go back to the original contract party -- SIGCORP ENERGY to get payment.    So TGT reversed the demand charges on our invoice and in turn sent an invoice to SIGCORP for this November 2001 production demand payment.    Thus it would appear that eventually ENA would have to make payment to SIGCORP Energy,   but as this winds thru the bankruptcy proceedings,  this issue will need to get clarified.

Chris Spears -- please put a copy of this email in your TGT files.

I have these 2 contracts highlighted in yellow and coded as Agency/Release.  They probably should just be release but I'll let you decide.

we bought PG&E, so those are actually our contracts.  In order for us to just use 1 logon, they had to make us agent

How does the agency with PG&E Energy Services work?

I show that EES is agent for two PG&E contracts.  Contract 67309 on CGAS and 67310 of Col Gulf.

I'm off tomorrow.  What are we doing?  Selling my Dad's wares and making a fortune?

Columbia Gas sent me the December invoices via federal express.  The cover letter states that Columbia Gas is aware that ENA will not be paying the pre-petition amounts but that they expect full payment for the post-petition amounts.

I'm sending you a copy of the letter.  I assume that we will not be paying any of the invoice.

Any news on the Columbia Gas park & loans?

Thanks
chris

FYI

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol "ENRNQ."  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC "Pink Sheets."

I just got a call from the guy that asked me to work on the Texas Desk.  He just eliminated my position and I think he may be making another cut or two as well.

I have a little more info. I'm still waiting for Gulf South which is the same thing as Koch.

The work schedule for the pigging of the PL-1 system that was originally
scheduled for Monday, June 10, 2002, has been changed to Wednesday June 12,
2002.  This notice replaces the previous notice posted on Tuesday June 4th.
The implementation of this restriction on Wednesday means that there will
be no interruptible transportation capacity or non-PL1 transportation
capacity available along the PL-1 system.  This restriction will also
require that all deliveries at that time on the PL-1 system be made to
their primary delivery point.  All interruptible and secondary deliveries
along the PL-1 system will be reduced to zero effective for the gas day of
June 12, 2002, at 10:00 ECT (9:00 CCT).  Please give me a call if you have
any questions.

I have a copy of what's in the files we made before the holidays.

did we have the copy of these agreements that are still valid???

#67401 and #70457 are the correct contracts.  #67401 was intended to come out in Dec and #70457 was intended to come out in Jan.

Hey there...

Can you please verify the following. Our files indicate that the two pal contracts for TCO are 39607 and 38079.
TCO is invoicing us on contracts 67401 and 70457. All these contracts show 310,000 MDQ.

Which ones are correct and current. I am assuming only 2 are or should be current. Please advise.

Thanks,
Maria

Wait just a minute.  Don't Goodell and I get a wedding invite?  Maybe we want to give you an expensive gift!  YEAH RIGHT!!!!!!   We are poorer than college students now.  I think you should send us an invite anyway.  Maybe I could make a bachelor party out of it.  At least I could get drunk.  So do you have all that wedding crap stuff done or is your MAN taking care of all that?  I always heard that it was WOMAN's work anyway.  

Those are fantastic grades.  You would have to ADD my old college grades together to get a 3.83, and I still think it would be a struggle.  I know you told me but I can't remember, whets is your major?  MBA?

Its good to hear about Alicia.  Is she going to grad school?

I don't know when me and my very pregnant girlfriend are getting married.  We move in together at the end of Feb.  I'm nervous about that.  I've been living alone since '97 and I just don't know why all you foolish people want to get married and live together.  I took some digital photo's of her yesterday.  I'll let you know if I get them on the web so you can take a look and make fun of me being a 40 year old father to be.

So you guys are just playing the good ole waiting game now, huh? Enron is the new favorite media topic. Criminal investigations out the wazoo. Shredding documents....that's a major no no. Anyhow, at least you've made it so far. So how are you doing other than work? Didn't you say that you were getting married? What's the deal with that?
As far as I am concerned, yes I am still in love. Our wedding is on March 23 on Clearwater Beach, FL. It should be pretty cool. School is awesome. I got a 3.83 last term. Hopefully I'll be able to pull off a 4.0 this time. I saw Alicia Perkins over Christmas. I drove over to Daytona Beach, FL to hang out with her. She is doing very well. She's working for her Dad's real estate company. Anyhow, I'll talk to you later. Take care.

We don't have a deadline.  Our lawyers are scattered pretty thin.  What would probably happen is that you guys might show me a bid for some of the capacity, then we would have to talk to the pipelines and see what they want to do.  

What is the deadline for the list of transport that y'all are releasing?? We
are starting to run some numbers.

I'm in class all day, so just give me an e-mail back.

HEY WOMAN!!!!   What the heck are you doing?

I did make it back.  I actually came in most of last week.  I just get way to bored at home in my tiny little apartment.  I have this strong urge to go out and spend  money and that's just the wrong thing to do right now.

We don't really know much about the New Company right now.  I'm actually on the estate team anyway.  I sit on 5 with Ruth Concannon, Sylvia Pollen, Robin Barbe, and Kathy Kelly.  The rumor 2 weeks ago was that UBS was going to cut 25% of the jobs if they won.  I think Victor said that we should know alot more by tomorrow.  I think I know of a couple of people that have left; David Jones (black guy in origination - real nice guy too) starts working for TXU in Dallas today, Darren Farmer (Texas Desk)  is going to AEP.

chris

Chris,

Did you ever make it back? How are people now that the bid winner has been
announced? Better I hope. Maybe it will seem like the wheels will start
rolling on the new business/company.

Hey, I just saw your email.  I'm still here.  I'm moving my stuff from 6 to
5 today and then I'm going to take the longest vacation of my life.  I may
or may not come in tomorrow but I will be out until Jan 2nd.  I'm probably
leaving early today too.  I may actually take the first week of Jan off
too.

How are you?  I just called your nubmer and got your voicemail.  I'm glad
you have something.  Don't be upset if I don't return your email for
awhile.  I'll be on vacation.

Later Gator

I've been waiting for an opportunity to speak with you but it appears that you have been very involved.

Daren Farmer works for Tom Martin on the Texas Desk upstairs.  Daren just accepted a position with AEP and Tom asked me if I would be interested in Daren's position.  I told him I would and I asked him to touch base with you.

I hope this link works.

I think this is funny.  I believe Enron laid off some incredibly talented people.  Gloria might like this.

http://www.laydoff.com/home.html

HEY GIRL.  It's so good to hear from you.  Let's see,

I'm still here.  I work on the estate team which means I work on the old stuff until they tell us to leave.  My buddy Goodell is will be working for NewCo (The New Company - is this original or what).  They should find out something in the next couple of days I think.  Other than that its just hand around and see what happens.

So did you make good grades?  What's that report card looking like.  How's the hubby?  You still in love or what?

Hey, are you still at Enron? The shit is really hitting the ceiling pretty hard, huh? So what's your story? How were your holidays?

Just so you don't forget me.  I know its early but I'm interested in coming back.  I'm sure you don't know what you will need until after we find out what happened today.  Tom Martin was asking me if I would be interested in going to the Texas Desk to take Daren Farmer's place, Daren is going to AEP.  I told him I would like to talk to you about the East Desk first.  Tom would like an answer by Monday.

Let me know.

Please get with me to discuss before 5:00 PM today.

FYI.  This is the formal response we received from Bridgeline yesterday.  In the event Bridgeline does not agree to purchase the gas, what delivery point on Bridgeline is best for us to use under FT if we were to bleed out the inventory over 30 days and what price could we get?

We appreciate your support on this.

Thanks.

Chip

Attached is a letter from Randy Curry faxed to me yesterday afternoon outlining the initial proposal made by Bridgeline in our meeting yesterday.  Bridgeline is not formally offering to purchase the gas, however, in a subsequent voice mail from Randy, such a purchase is not out of the question.

Additionally, ChevTex has formally requested through Jayne that the accounting information be provided for their review.  I agree with Mark Ellenberg's view that we should not provide this until we have agreement on the commercial deal.  Jayne/Stephen, I would like to hear from you on this.

We need to huddle today to discuss our response to Randy's letter and keep the momentum alive.  Given the LIP meetings this morning, can I suggest 3:00 this morning in ECN2829?

Before then, I may be calling around to get people's views on a response.

Thanks,

Chip

 

 	

Have we flowed any IT transport on the East Desk pipelines for the month of January?  I think the answer is no but I wanted to double check?  If we did, then I need to know the pipeline, contract number and probably the volume.

Thanks. 

Now I remember!!!  Do you just need IT contracts on pipes with firm transport or it on all pipelines?  Who is Rita?

Hey there...

When you get a chance...I need the IT contracts that might have been used for the East Region for each pipeline. I need to get with Rita Wynne and determine what/if any amount that we owe on these contracts as well.

Thanks

I just received a call from Carol Taylor at National Fuel.  She told me that contract B00693-038181 was recalled effective 1/1/2002.  This was capacity we received from AEC - one of those producer netback deals.

Ain't that the truth.  Wait just a minute, I took Monday off and I think I'm taking Friday of next week off.  Never mind.

Five day work weeks are VERY long.  I haven't had one in a few weeks.

Space from Niagara to Leidy is available for 35,000 dth.  Excess injection or IAS payback is available for 20,000 dth and excess withdrawals can increase by 100,000 dth for tomorrow's gas day.

QUOTE OF THE DAY
=========================
"Do we really want to bid for the games in the future? It's a
valid question. I believe the money is well spent; it makes
a great statement for peace. But is it a good investment?"
-MITT ROMNEY, president of the Salt Lake City Olympic organizing
committee, on the cost of holding the Games in the United
States.

Good Question?

What the heck are you doing?  I know you miss me asking you dumb questions every once in a while.  I'm still here, at Enron that is.  Maybe I'll call you up and hassle you later.

Yep.  We went for and ultra sound last Thursday and the doc asked "do you want to know what the sex is?"  I said YES and she said NO and the doc said ok we won't look.

Is audrey and christopher the names?

Well, I told Ingird that I was madly in love with you but that you
constantly rejected my advances.

AND I DO provide her with love and support.  I'm all over this marriage
thing and I told her "no more lovin until she makes and honest married man
outta me".  We get our new apartment on Feb 22 and she be living together
by Mar 1st.  Don't know if I'll be a married man by then or not.  We are
going to look for a cute little chapel type thing this weekend.  I'm still
trying to make her cat disappear.  I'm telling her if that cat leaves one
mark on my little Christopher or Audrey, out the cat goes.

Well, I told Ingird that I was madly in love with you but that you constantly rejected my advances.

AND I DO provide her with love and support.  I'm all over this marriage thing and I told her "no more lovin until she makes and honest married man outta me".  We get our new apartment on Feb 22 and she be living together by Mar 1st.  Don't know if I'll be a married man by then or not.  We are going to look for a cute little chapel type thing this weekend.  I'm still trying to make her cat disappear.  I'm telling her if that cat leaves one mark on my little Christopher or Audrey, out the cat goes.

I didn't say anything bad... so when's the wedding??

Robbie is fine... he got a new bed last weekend... yippee!!It's delivered on
Saturday... can't wait to try it out. Last bed was held up by phone books.

Cats are good... starting to run through the house... forgetting they lost
their claws.

Work is slow... so teaching myself some NE transport.

Be good to Ingrid... she needs your love and support!!

Hey woman!  What are you doing talking to my pregnant chic?  I going to
tell her that anything bad you said about me is a lie.

AND YES, all I do is goof off.  What else is there to do?

How's your boy doing?  How are the cats?  How's the job?  How old are you?

This one is easy, Texas Gas k#T018123 was recalled effective 12/14/01.

Yes, this contract was recalled effective December 14, 2001. 
Steve Menke said you would know the answer. 

I purchased capacity from Steve last October.  The terms were as follows; 
Release Date    11/1/2001 through 3/31/2002 
Volume          18,000 dth 
Contract        T0181230000 
Offer           #200110000095 

Steve said he thought they recalled this capacity.  Would you see if it was recalled and if it was, what was the effective date of the recall.

Thanks

As I getting back up to speed on the last week in the Gas industry I see falling prices and widening spreads on Niagara to Leidy which explains why I only have 18,000 available on IT from Niagara to Leidy with another 10,000 available from Pendleton to Leidy.

What happened to Dallas yesterday, I mean Detroit really?!

I'm not sure what you mean by valid.  We are not physically flowing any of this gas right now.  There are some small Appalachian producers on here that are still up in the air but we will probably reject those contracts anyway.

Chris,

Are these valid Sitara deals?? - can you tell us a little about them

I've attached the excel file - but some examples are Sitara no. 83618, 229971  etc

I received another voicemail notice on my pager yesterday afternoon.  Have you had any luck with this?
 
How about this?  Do you know how long I'm going to be employed for?  Any news at all?

im still trying to get a number..can't find the invoices 

Hey, what about my pager? 

Hey woman.  Have I told you what a good person you are?  You're sweet.  I have plans on Friday but be sure to give Dan a great big hug from ME!!!!!!  And thanks for thinking of me when you sent out this email.

I was not in the office today.  I just check my emails from home.  I'm taking Matt Fleming to YOUR BBQ place next week.  He hasn't found a job yet.  I told him that it felt like a bunch of us estaters would be let go soon, don't know why, just a feeling.

are you in the office today? 
Luling is by the pound, so my eyes are bigger than my gut.
Try Swinging Door in Richmond, TX.
Are you a Joe's fan in Alvin?

Where the heck is Somerset?  And who cares anyway?
 
I hope you had a happy New Year buddy.  Indrid and I went to Lulling City Market over the weekend.  That is without a doubt the best BBQ I have ever had.    YOU DE MAN!!!!!!!!

To my knowledge, we are not agent for these guys anymore.  I will double check with Germany, but I don't think we should roll into 2002.

Thanks for writing buddy.  Things are going very well on the home front.  Things began to improve after you and I had our little chat before Christmas and they have been improving ever since.  I really do appreciate it.
 
How's work at Enron?  Good question.  I started taking my vacation on the 27th.  I'm scheduled to be out until the 14th to use up all of my 2001 vacation.  I honestly believe some of us will be let go this week or next week.  But then its anybodys guess these days too.  I do check my emails from home and thats when I got your message.  There isn't anything to do at work right now.  I guess we should hear something this week.
 
How are things going with you?

What is up dude?  I am genuinely interested in how things are working out on

the home front, as well as work.

As of 2:00 P.M., Steve has not heard from Col Gas.

I will be taking my vacation through Monday, Jan 14th.  I have a sneaky feeling that I may be let go before then anyway.  I will be checking my voicemail everyday and my emails every other day.  Also, I don't plan on being out of town for more than a day over the next 2 weeks.  I may leave town a few days during the week of Jan 7th. 

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose "request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts."
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

Hey, what about my pager?

I don't see you in MSN Messenger either.

Chris, 
	Your phone is installed down here so i don't think you'll be able to answer it over there.  Do you want me to forward it to Judy's line, temporarily?

works for me.  thanks

Chris, 
	Your phone is installed down here so i don't think you'll be able to answer it over there.  Do you want me to forward it to Judy's line, temporarily?

Actually I am.  The little woman and the little bundle of joy both sleep in the other room.  Makes it easy for me.  My woman is trying to breastfeed.  I can't tell you how stressfull that has been.  There needs to be a class for guys on how to best support their "Woman" after birth.

Ahhh, my little bundle of joy is cute though.  And her mom lives in town and spends a lot of time over at out place which works out great.  We can go out for dinner pretty easy.  A lot of people don't seem to have that.  Judy said she would baby sit but it's not worth the trip to the edge of the earth in Katy.

Well, I don't know.  I tried emailing him but haven't gotten a response.  
Guess he doesn't want to talk to me....

Are you getting any sleep these days with the new addition?

Angie

Is my buddy Robert Allwein working with you?  If so give him a big kiss and 
a hug from me.

2 weeks ago, I received a page and the message box on my pager said "voicemail".  Would you see if I have voicemail and if I do, how do I access it.

Thanks

My pager number is 877-498-5497

ditto  :)

See that means I'm like Patrick Swazzie in the movie Ghost.  He was way toooo macho to use the love word so he came up with an acceptable alternative.  But if I die and I come back to haunt you, I won't be using the word ditto.  I'll probably make reference to a Shetlon Pony.  That way you will know its me.

I wuv you.      ii 

I'm leaving for the day.  All of my notes are on the word document.

I just spoke with my contact at Columbia Gas and she suggested that we call Columbia Gas's in-house counsel to discuss the issue.  I just update my word document with that information.

Steve, you may receive this email before I get to your office.  I will hand deliver the following items;
1.  The word document attached to this email
2.  Copy of the Columbia Gas PAL and FTS rate shedule from their tariff
3.  Copies of the 2 PAL's contracts that ENA is trying to utilize
4.  A copy of 1 of our FTS contracts
5.  Select sheets from Columbia Gas's tariff that apply to Creditworthiness.

Ed, I will be in on Wednesday to resolve this issue.  Then I will be taking ALL OF MY 2000 vacation until it runs out, which will be sometime during the second week of Jan.

 

So it was 10:00 AM and I'm about to leave, RIGHT?  My new boss says go sell that storage gas.  hmmm.  WHAT IF THE g.D. PIPELINE WON'T LET ME SHEDULE IT?  SHOULD I TRY TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE ON A FRIDAY, THE FRIDAY BEFORE OUR CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY?  HOW ABOUT ALL THEM g.D. DAYS I WAS ASKING TO CALL THE PIPELINE TO SEE WHAT THEY WOULD AND WOULD NOT LET US DO?  I now have work to do.

I'm not going shopping until this evening.

Have a nice day.

I'm looking for a general doctor and I'm thinking about using the hospital they work at as a guide.  What do you think?  Also, these people are all FAMILY PRACTICE, I wonder if I can use and INTERNAL MEDICINE doc as my primary physician.   Hmmmmmm.

Terry Kain with Keyspan Energy Services is looking for a copy of their contract with ENA.  I didn't ask him any questions.  I just told him that someone would contact him.  His number is 516-256-2611.

I don't see you on MSN?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?

Hey, I just saw your email.  I'm still here.  I'm moving my stuff from 6 to 5 today and then I'm going to take the longest vacation of my life.  I may or may not come in tomorrow but I will be out until Jan 2nd.  I'm probably leaving early today too.  I may actually take the first week of Jan off too.  

How are you?  I just called your nubmer and got your voicemail.  I'm glad you have something.  Don't be upset if I don't return your email for awhile.  I'll be on vacation.

HEY!!!  Not too much time to talk.  I'm wrapping a few things up before I take the longest vacation of my life.  I may not come in tomorrow.  We will be there Saturday with bells on.  My little woman will probably need to take a nap in the back bedroom if that's ok.  Send me an email at home AND here and let me know what time to show up.  Also, she wants to know if we need to bring any snack stuff.

Hey Buddy,

How are you?  Are you guys coming down Saturday?  Just checking.  We are
going to play the Christmas Game!  No silly, not spin the bottle, although,
there may be a few bottles spent.  The you buy a gift under $20 and try to
maintain possession of it for three turns.  We are just having snack type
food.  Let me know so I can tell my WIFE!!!

I have been working with a couple of other people trying to capture a new
recycle scrap metal contract.  We wrapped that baby up yesterday.  It has
been negotiations in earnest for the past four months.  The first real
contract negotiation I have been involved in.  The market is really tough
right now.  I am hoping for at max a third quarter rebound.  I heard some
analyst predictions which stated the global economy/demand may remain flat
for the next eight years.  I surely hope they are incorrect.

How's things in the Big City?  How's the job?  Let me know if you are coming
Saturday.

Yo' Bro'

Don

I am talking to your other brother .  He says hi! 

Hey buddy.  You gave us the info for NNG, any luck with the SCAL and PGEN volumes?

I had most of the details yesterday morning, my fault for not responding.  And I also didn't clue into the 4/99 contract start date as well.

With Rita and Kevin's help, we have identified 4 deals for American Public Energy Agency

Deal #		Contract	End Date	Pipeline		Comment
310424		96026367	4/30/2011	NNG		Did not receive any gas for December 2001
310690		96012204	5/31/2008	NNG		Did not receive any gas for December 2001
936073		96021055	4/30/2011	PGEN		Need to see when physical flow stopped
936263		96021053	4/30/2011	SCAL		Need to see when physical flow stopped.

Rita, you ran the Deal Volume Tracking report for Dec 2001 and you found the PGEN and SCAL deals.  Would you please run a report for Nov 2001 just to make sure that we have all the current deals?

Kevin, try to determine the last day ENA supplied these deals.

Thanks.

I'm out this afternoon.  Please call me on my cell phone of you have any questions.  My number is 713-557-5095.

Thanks.

Chris,  When did we stop performing on this deal?

I love baby pictures!!!!

Here is a little more info in the Tenn/Sonat park & loan deal.  The volume is 500,195 dth parked in Bear Creek storage on Tenn contract 15692.  It was suppossed to come out on Sonat this month but we never scheduled it.  Yesterday, Clarissa Garcia tried to schedule some of this gas for today's gas day.  We don't know if Tenn allowed us to schedule it yet.

Summary
There is only 1 Tenn park & loan deal for 500,195
2 Cgas park & loan deals shown below.  We have not scheduled any of the CGAS park & loan deals.

I really need to chat with the pipeline on this one but this is my best guess right now.  This gas was parked at Bear Creek on a Tenn park and loan contract.  It is scheduled to come out on Sonat.  To my knowledge, we don't have any Sonat demand charges.  But our monthly demand charge expense on Tenn is at least $376,000.00, mainly due to the Boston Gas netback deal.  I think Tenn would make us prepay the Tenn demand charges to get this gas out of the park & loan on Sonat.

We have 500,000 that was scheduled to come out in December on Sonat.  I have no idea how Tenn/Sonat will bill us for this contract going forward.

We currently have 2 park & loan deals with Colubia Gas.

Deal 1) we have 310,000 that was scheduled to come out in December, contract #67401, we are currently paying $8370.00 per month on this deal.

Deal 2) we have 310,000 scheduled to come out in January 2002, contract #70457, we are currently paying $16,740.00 per month.

I have not spoken to the pipeline but I believe we would have to prepay all of our transport demand charge expenses before CGAS will let us schedule any of this gas.  Our monthly demand charge expense is $290,000.00.  I would also assume that we would have to prepay the EES demand charges as well.

Hi Paul,

I just left you a voice mail.  I'm about to leave for the day but I wanted to let you know what I'm looking for.  I work on the East Desk at ENA and I'm trying to get copies of the following ENA and EES contracts.  These are the firm contracts listed on your ENA and EES notices dated November 29th and November 30th that I don't have.

ENA contracts
6020
5085
5072

EES contracts
6115
5916

I appreciate your help.  Please call me at 713-853-4743 of you have any comments or questions.

Bill,

As per our conversation today, I am sending you an outline of what we intend to be doing in Ercot and in particular on the real-time desk. For 2002 Ercot is split into 4 zones with TCRs between 3 of the zones. The zones are fairly diverse from a supply/demand perspective. Ercot has an average load of 38,000 MW, a peak of 57,000 MW with a breakdown of 30% industrial, 30% commercial and 40% residential. There are already several successful aggregators that are looking to pass on their wholesale risk to a credit-worthy QSE (Qualified Scheduling Entity). 

Our expectation is that we will be a fully qualified QSE by mid-March with the APX covering us up to that point. Our initial on-line products will include a bal day and next day financial product. (There is no day ahead settlement in this market). There are more than 10 industrial loads with greater than 150 MW concentrated at single meters offering good opportunities for real-time optimization. Our intent is to secure one of these within the next 2 months.

I have included some price history to show the hourly volatility and a business plan to show the scope of the opportunity. In addition, we have very solid analytics that use power flow simulations to map out expected outcomes in the real-time market.

The initial job opportunity will involve an analysis of the real-time market as it stands today with a view to trading around our information. This will also drive which specific assets we approach to manage. As we are loosely combining our Texas gas and Ercot power desks our information flow will be superior and I believe we will have all the tools needed for a successful real-time operation.

Let me know if you have any further questions.

Thanks,

Doug
  

  

can we make any ercot discussion tomorrow as I am out friday??

The retail stuff needs to be close behind the qse registration. we are putting a timeline together for it.

Thanks,

Doug

UBS Legal and UBS Credit is heading to Houston this Thursday and Friday.  I have asked that ERCOT matters get 1 hour to discuss the necessary contracts that UBS will need to sign to participate in the ERCOT market.

Basically, my understanding is the following --

1.	PUCT Registration Form for Power Marketer
2.	ERCOT ISO Information
	QSE
	LSE
	Wholesale Enabling Agreement
	Other
3.	APX Agreement?
4.	Other

Given the list of issues, this assumes that UBSW Energy will not be selling electricity at retail.  If we need this for Day 1, we would have to get an additional license from the PUCT.

Thanks,

Jim

please authorize seung-taek oh to manage the bal day fin products.

thanks,

We just need your authorization to set him up in the system. Please disregard previous message regarding products.

New deals. May try and bring a couple of deals over but not sure what the wrkings of that will look like. 

Doug
Doug-Gilbert Smith

I expect we will look to qualify asap but that we can use the apx if need be. I was not looking to trade too much physical up front instead, looking to build positions so that they go to phys delivery around the same time we are set up. There are some significant deals that we require us certified quickly and I do not see that being a problem. 

I will be in in the morning if you want to catch me then. 

Take care,

Doug
Doug-Gilbert Smith

TJae,

just to let you know. I am out Friday thru Thurs of next week. King is out thru this wednesday and Seung Taek is out thru Thurs. I will also be out tuesday afternoon and wednesday morning getting my eyes lasered.

I am on my cell- 713-858-5476

Thanks,

Doug

The meeting will be at 1pm in 38c2 with Bryan Murtaugh.

Thanks.

 
Let me know if you have any questions. The correlations are approximate but I do not expect too much deviation from these numbers.

Thanks,

Doug

Fellas,

Presto has asked me to be the contact to Allan Stewart at PIRA with regard to setting up an arrangement for their consulting services.  I'm currently having information-gathering discussions over services and fees for both gas and power, in both the east and west.  In order to fully incorporate everyone's needs into our arrangement with PIRA, I'll be contacting you this week to gather requests.  Or, if you know what you need, please just reply to me with the specific information.

Thanks,

Fletch

great.

Where you want to meet at 10?

Absolutely.  I'll be right by presto on 6 in a week.

no problem. Likewise, I would like to be kept in touch with what you guys are up to as well.

Thanks,

Doug

Doug --

Please do not send anything out to the PUC until my team has reviewed.

Jim

OK - Doug can have Smith Day and Jeff Miller work to get the retail certification.

We need to have everything in 30 days.  I know that.

The question is given everything else - FERC MBR, gas pipelines, PJM, etc. - isn't it better to move into ERCOT at the wholesale level and then come back after getting the rest of the market moving along?

From a resource standpoint, I need to understand how to get PUCT counsel for UBS to start the REP process anyway.

JIm

We need it w/in the first 30 days.

But do we need it immediately? Can we file later for retail authority?

Frank,

how do you want the power measured for your liquidity matrix? I also want to make sure that the correlations, while independently calced, are accurate.

Let me know,

Thanks,

Doug

need help-I do not manage a stack right now but will be in a couple of weeks.

Thanks,

Doug

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

Is it really necessary to change the book names just to avoid confusion?  Who 
is confused?  Can't we just inform those who need to know that the Denver 
books are simply another desk that rolls up into the West Region?  I don't 
want to be difficult, but it will require a great deal of time and effort to 
change every deal in the Denver books to a new name.  Let me know what you 
think.

DG    3-9573

   
	
	

Is this possible to do easily?

As part of the Doorstep project, (internal audit) it has become apparrent 
that we should rename the Denver trading books in order to avoid confusion in 
regards to who manages the risk in those books.  Since we have completed the 
transfer of those books to Houston and Jay is now managing those books I 
think it is appropriate to remove Denver from the title so people outside of 
the West Group don't think we are trading in Denver.  Of course we will 
continue to support Jay in whatever he needs and provide the middle market 
and origination coverage to the customers associated with the deals in this 
book.

Let me know if anyone has any concerns regarding this and Shona Wilson can 
make the name changes if we let her know what name to change it to.

Mark

Here it is.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Hi guys,

I've just come across a few deals that are in TAGG as settling between
ENA and Aquila Canada Corp.  These deals would not have shown up when
you looked for deals to flip to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as they aren't in
TAGG as ECC deals.  I have a feeling that there are lots of deals like this in
TAGG, but I just don't know where. We are having problems printing TAGG 
tickets 
up here, so I'm not able to see which books these deals are in right now.  
What I'm 
requesting is that you go through all your books and look for all deals with 
Aquila
Canada Corp. that are to settle for March and April 2001, and after, and flip 
these
deals into the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as soon as possible.  As it stands, 
I'm missing at least 10 deals from the April 2001 Nymex invoice, and I want to
make sure that these deals don't get invoiced by someone in Houston 
settlements.
Nymex settled yesterday for April, so invoicing for these deals is taking 
place
today.  

I understand that you are all very busy right now, but it would really be 
appreciated
if this was dealt with as soon as possible today.  The settlements group and 
I need
to get our invoices sent out today, so we need these deals to be fixed right 
away.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this matter, and let me know 
if I 
can assist you in any way.

Thanks so much for your help
Stacey-

We added $75M so Schedule C tonight.

DG

Done

It appears everybody can do lunch tomorrow (the 28th).  Send me what times
work for you and a suggestion of a central place to eat.  Any time is good
for me.  My best guess for a central location would be Treebeards in the
tunnel, but anyplace is fine with me.  Let me know.

Could you please do me a favor, and make sure that all Canadian deals
that are in Houston books are flipped to the P& book.  I don't have a current 
list of
all the desk leads, so I thought that I'd ask you to forward this message
on to them for me.  I know that the EOL group is still working on a solution
to our problem, but there are still deals that are in Houston books
that need to be flipped.

Please let me know if there is anything I can help with.  Thanks for your
help on this.

Jennifer,

NGI-PGE/TOPOCK is an internal curve used to value transport and is equal to 
NGI-SOCAL.  This curve will probably show up every month because the West 
Coast is very volitile.  The change is due to a change in the market.

IF-TW/PERMIAN is a production area curve.  The change is also due to  market 
changes that drove up the curve.

Call me if you have any questions.  Thanks.

DG    3-9573

   
	
	

Darron --

Can you or anyone in your group follow up on the curves below?

NGI-PGE TOPOCK
IF-VALERO TX
IF-TW PERMIAN

Thanks,
Jennifer
	
	

Hi guys --

Hopefully these curves are covered between the three of you!  Attached are 
the 10 curves reviewed for the month of February.  Of these 10, the curves in 
question are:

NGI-PGE TOPOCK
IF-HEHUB
IF-VALERO TX

If you could, please identify the factors that are driving their drastic 
changes in shape and seasonality as compared to the prior month.  Please do 
not hesitate to contact me with any questions.

Thanks,

Hi 
If you've aleady received this, my  apologies. On the other hand, if not, 

please read and forward around the world. 

Nike now lets you personalize your shoes by submitting a word or  phrase 
which they will stitch onto your shoes, under the  swoosh. So Jonah 
Peretti 
filled  out the form and sent them $50 to stitch "sweatshop" onto his 
shoes. 

Here's the responses he got... fun and games with Nike...  

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *   
Your NIKE iD order was cancelled for one or more of the  following 
reasons: 

1) Your Personal iD contains another party's trademark  
2) Your Personal iD contains the name of an athlete or team we  do not 
have 
the legal right to  use 
3) Your Personal iD was left blank. Did you not want  any 
personalization? 
4) Your  Personal iD contains profanity or inappropriate slang, and 
besides, 
your mother would slap us.  
If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new  personalization 
please visit us again at  www.nike.com 

Thank you, NIKE iD 

Greetings, 

My order was canceled but my personal NIKE iD does not violate  any of 
the 
criteria outlined in  your message. The Personal iD on my custom ZOOM XC 
USA 
running shoes was the word  "sweatshop." 
Sweatshop is not: 
1) another's party's trademark, 
2) the name of an  athlete, 
3) blank, or 
4)  profanity. 

I choose the iD because I wanted to remember the toil and labor  of the 
children that made my shoes. Could you please  ship them to me 
immediately. 

Thanks and Happy New Year, Jonah Peretti 

Dear NIKE iD Customer, 

Your NIKE iD order was cancelled because the iD you have  chosen 
contains, as 
stated in  the previous e-mail correspondence, "inappropriate slang". 
If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new  personalization 
please visit us again at nike.com  

Thank you, NIKE iD 

Dear NIKE iD, 

Thank you for your quick response to my inquiry about my custom  ZOOM XC 
USA 
running shoes.  Although I commend you for your prompt customer service, 
I 
disagree with the claim that my personal iD  was 
inappropriate slang. After consulting Webster's  Dictionary, I discovered 

that "sweatshop" is in fact part of standard English, and not  slang. 

The word means: "a shop or factory in which workers are employed  for 
long 
hours at low wages and  under unhealthy conditions" and its origin dates 
from  1892. So my personal iD does meet the criteria detailed in your 
first 
email. 

Your web site advertises that the NIKE iD program is "about  freedom to 
choose and freedom to express who you are." I  share Nike's love of 
freedom 
and  personal expression. The site also says that "If you want it 
done right...build it yourself." I was thrilled to be able to build  my 
own 
shoes, and my personal iD  was offered as a small token of appreciation 
for  
the sweatshop workers poised to help me realize my vision. I  hope that 
you 
will value my  freedom of expression and reconsider your decision to 
reject 
my order. 

Thank you, Jonah Peretti 

Dear NIKE iD Customer, 

Regarding the rules for personalization it also states on the  NIKE iD 
web 
site that "Nike  reserves the right to cancel any personal iD up to 24 
hours 
after it has been submitted". In addition,  it further explains: "While 
we 
honor most personal iDs, we cannot honor every one. 
Some may be (or contain) other's trademarks, or the names of  certain 
professional sports teams, athletes or  celebrities that Nike does not 
have 
the right to use. Others may contain material that we consider  
inappropriate or simply do not want to place on our  products. 
Unfortunately, at times this obliges us to  decline personal iDs that may 

otherwise seem unobjectionable. In any event, we will let you  know if we 

decline your personal iD, and we will offer you the chance to  submit 
another." With these rules in mind, we cannot  accept your order as 
submitted. If you wish to reorder  your NIKE iD product with a new 
personalization please  visit us again at www.nike.com 

Thank you, NIKE iD 

Dear NIKE iD, 

Thank you for the time and energy you have spent on my request.  I have 
decided to order the shoes with a different iD,  but I would like to make 
one 
small request. Could you please send me a color snapshot of the  
ten-year-old Vietnamese girl who makes my shoes? 

Thanks, 
Jonah Peretti 

As one forwarder writes: 

... this will now go round the world much farther and faster  than any of 
the 
adverts they  paid Michael Jordan more than the entire wage packet of all 

their sweatshop workers in the world to do... 

I normally avoid making a plea to pass on these things,  
but this time I say: 

JUST DO IT

Hi guys,

I've come across this deal that needs to be flipped right away.
This deal is in the MGMT-WEST book with Aquila Canada Corp. and
ENA.  It needs to be in the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book settling between
ECC and Aquila Canada Corp.  This is causing problems with the 
February Liquidations as I settled this deal with Aquila, but it isn't coming
through the liquidations correctly.  Please let me know when this is done
so I can let Shannon McPearson know that she needs to re-run the 
February Liquidations.

Thanks
Stacey

Jeff --

Before I send out the memo for January, I have a few questions about 3 curves 
that were reviewed this month.  Attached are Powerpoint slides containg the 
10 curves that were validated for January.  The ones I'm asking you to take a 
look at are:

1)  NGI-SOCAL -- Why the upshift for the entire curve compared to prior 
month?  Why has the shape of the curve changed from (approximately) 1/1/04 
forward compared to the curve from prior month?

2)  IF-MONCHY -- What factors account for differences between the 1/31/01 
curve vs. the 12/29/00 curve for the period between 1/1/01through 1/1/07?

3)  IF-TRANSCO Z3 --  What factors account for the entire curve changing so

Darron,

Could you make sure that these seven deals are changed in Tagg to ENA I would 
really appreciate it.  Thanks for all of your help with these specific 
deals.  Also, if you could let me know when they are corrected, I will let 
Bob Bowen know.  Thanks TARA

Please change to ENA instead of Riskmantra:
QL0460
QM6735
QM3739
QN0626
QN7938

  Little  Johnny  walked  into  his  dad's bedroom one day and found him
  sitting  on  the side of his bed sliding a condom onto his dick. In an
  attempt  to hide his full erection, Johnny's father bent over as if to
  look under the bed.

  Little Johnny asked curiously, "What ya doin', Dad?"

  His  father  quickly replied, "I thought I saw a rat go underneath the
  bed."

  Johnny replied, "What ya gonna do, fuck him?"

I do

Thanks.  I noticed Lisa indicated that Linda was getting additional info.  Is 
it ready?  Mike Grigsby, who is the head physical trader on the desk asked 
about Tenaska.  He thinks that they also charged us.  Please let me know.  
Thanks again.

Darron,

If you guys want to go to WP, that is fine with me.  I will be able to go a
few days.  Do you need a ride from the airport?  Let me know.  See you in a
few weeks.

P.S.  Attached is our new yellow lab that Tracie gave me for my birthday.

No, we will go to Keystone instead of WP.  We are paying either way, and so 
it doesn't matter to me.  Also, I have never been to Keystone and would like 
to go.  And I will have a rental car.  We are looking forward to seeing you.

Sean,
I found out that Silver Creek is a very small resort close to the town of 
Granby, CO.  It is acutally 15 miles north of Winter Park and 2 miles south 
of Granby along Hwy 40.  We are staying at a condo there from Sunday night 
(11th) thru Thursday night (15th).  I indicated we would like to go to Winter 
Park because we have been there and it is close.  We want to ski 2 days in 
Silver Creek and 2 days somewhere else.  If you can make it during the week 
to Keystone, then yes we will go there instead of WP.  I would love to go to 
an Avs game, but we will probably need to be on the road by late afternoon on 
Sunday.

Once again, we get in on Saturday (10th) about 9pm.  That's pretty late so we 
may or may not be able to do anything that night.  We will leave on Sunday 
(11th) for Silvercreek and be back in Denver at your place on Friday (16th).  
Then our plane back to Houston is early Saturday (17th) morning.  If you can 
get away during the week to ski, that would be awesome.  Thanks for all your 
hospitality.  See you soon.

DG

Darron,

The weather is great here.  In March, we receive every type of weather.  One
day we could get 12 inches of snow, the next day it could be 80!  I have a
pass to Keystone, Breckenridge, Vail, Beaver Creek, and A-Basin.  My pass
does not include Winter Park (although I have a free lift ticket that I
could use and go skiing with you.).  My pass cost $300 and I get unlimited
use (I have been 23 times this year-I think I got my money worth!).  I do
not know where Silvercreek is, but I will look. Do you mean Silverthorne by
chance?  If there is any way to go to Keystone, it would save Tracie and I
some money.  But, I understand that it is your vacation and if you go to
Winter Park, let me know and price is no concern.  This is how I rank the
resorts as far as skiing: 1. Vail  2. Copper  3. Keystone  4. Winter
Park/Mary Jane  5. Breckenridge.

I have not been to Beaver Creek, but I heard that it was awesome.  Even
though I ranked WP fourth, it is still a great resort.  The runs at Keystone
and Vail are long and Vail is the largest resort in USA (5300 acres compared
to 2000 for Keystone!).  As far as atmosphere (night life), Vail is by far
the best.  Winter Park does not have much at the ski resort as far as night
life (that I recall, but I have not been there much.).  You have to go into
town, which is small.  Breckenridge is good for the night as well and so is
Copper, but Vail is the best (I love Vail if you have not noticed!).  Just
let me know as far as plans.  We have a busy March.  On March 17, the day
you leave, we have a wedding.  On Friday night, we might have to go to the
rehearsal dinner, but I do not know yet.  Michelle and the kids are coming
up in March also.  Maybe she can come up at the same time.  We always have a
room available.

I am looking forward to seeing you and Kristi.  Let me know if you guys want
to do anything in Denver.  You can also go snowmobiling and snowshoeing as
well.

If you guys need any ski gear or accessories, let me know and I will check
here for prices.  Plus, you can borrow some of my gear on the days I can't
meet up with you.

You guys are going to love it here.  You also need to come out in the
summertime.  It is so much better.  I think my sisters and dad are coming
out again for the 4th of July.  We went white water rafting last year and
Kim loved it.

Looking forward to seeing you.

Sean

Get this to Jim.

Please let me know when this may be available.  You may save the support to

I realize some of the may be transport and the detail should be minimal due 
to MGMT books; however, there are usually some Gas Daily deals that remain on 
the desk.

I WILL ALSO NEED SUPPORT FOR THE  DECEMBER AND JANUARY VALUES FOR ALL OF YOUR 
REGIONS IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY SAVE THEM OUT TO THE ABOVE DIRECTORY.

What is Love

A group of professional people posed this question to
a group of 4 to 8 year-olds, "What does love mean?"

The answers they got were broader and deeper than
anyone could have imagined. See what you think.

"When you tell someone something bad about yourself
and you're scared they won't love you anymore. But
then you get surprised because not only do they still
love you, they love you even more." Matthew - age 7

"Love is that first feeling you feel before all the
bad stuff gets in the way." - Charlie age 5

"God could have said magic words to make the nails
fall off the cross,but He didn't. That's love."? Max -
age 5

"When my grandmother got arthritis, she couldn't bend
over and paint her toenails anymore. So my grandfather
does it for her all the time, even when his hands got
arthritis too. That's love." - Rebecca - age 8

"When someone loves you, the way they say your name is
different. You know that your name is safe in their
mouth." - Billy - age 4

"Love is when a girl puts on perfume and a boy puts on
shaving cologne and they go out and smell each other."
- Karl - age 5

"Love is when you go out to eat and give somebody most
of your French fries without making them give you any
of theirs." - Chrissy - age 6

"Love is when someone hurts you. And you get so mad
but you don't yell at them because you know it would
hurt their feelings." - Samantha - age 6

"Love is what makes you smile when you're tired." -
Terri - age 4

"Love is when my mommy makes coffee for my daddy and
she takes a sip before giving it to him, to make sure
the taste is OK." - Danny - age 7

"Love is when you kiss all the time. Then when you get
tired of kissing, you still want to be together and
you talk more. My mommy and Daddy are like that. They
look gross when they kiss." - Emily - age 8

"Love is what's in the room with you at Christmas if
you stop opening presents and listen." - Bobby - age 5

"If you want to learn to love better, you should start
with a friend who you hate." - Nikka - age 6

"Love is hugging. Love is kissing. Love is saying no"
- Patty - age 8

"There are two kinds of love. Our love. God's love.
But God makes both kinds of them." - Jenny - age 4

"Love is when you tell a guy you like his shirt, then
he wears it everyday." - Noelle - age 7

"Love is like a little old woman and a little old man
who are still friends even after they know each other
so well." - Tommy - age 6

"During my piano recital, I was on a stage and scared.
I looked at all the people watching me and saw my
daddy waving and smiling. He was the only one doing
that. I wasn't scared anymore." Cindy - age 8

"My mommy loves me more than anybody. You don't see
anyone else kissing me to sleep at night." - Clare -
Age 5

"Love is when mommy gives daddy the best piece of
chicken." Elaine -age 5

"Love is when mommy sees daddy smelly and sweaty and
still says he is handsomer than Robert Redford." -
Chris - age 8

"Love is when your puppy licks your face even after
you left him alone all day." - Mary Ann - age 4

"I know my older sister loves me because she gives me
all her old clothes and has to go out and buy new
ones." - Lauren - age - 4

"I let my big sister pick on me because my Mom says
she only picks on me because she loves me. So I pick
on my baby sister because I love her." Bethany - age 4

"Love cards like Valentine's cards say stuff on them
that we'd like to say ourselves, but we wouldn't be
caught dead saying." - Mike - age 8

"When you love somebody, your eyelashes go up and down
and little stars come out of you." - Karen - age 7

"Love is when mommy sees daddy on the toilet and she
doesn't think it's gross." - Mark - age 6

it. But if you mean it, you should say it a lot.
People forget." - Jessica - age 8

I can't believe that I said what I did this morning.  It was selfish and I 
sincerely appologize.  I don't know what I was thinking or why.  Well,  I 
just listened to your message and I deserve all of it.  Even though you may 
not believe it.  I do love you, but many times cannot justify my actions.  I 
love you very much, and will call you later.

I just came across a counterparty that needs to be flipped to the 
FT-US/CAND-ERMS book for all deals in Houston books.  ECC has now signed a 
Master Swap Agreement with Aquila Canada Corp., and all deals traded with ENA 
and Aquila Canada Corp. need to be settled with ECC in the P& book.  These 
deals are showing up in TAGG as settling with ENA, could you all please keep 
an eye out for deals with this company and flip them right away.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.

This is just a quick reminder for all of you to please go into all of your 
books and flip out all the deals that are supposed to settle with ECC and a 
third counterparty  to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book by the end of the day today.  
Nymex closes today, and we need to make sure that all the deals are booked 
correctly for both the Calgary and Houston offices.  This is most important 
for February and March 2001 deals.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.

Thanks for all your help

This deal is related to the long term transportation that was sold to 
Calpine, but it is correctly booked as a physical forward sale at Malin.

Darron,

This is the deal I phoned you about yesterday which Eric Moon put together  
-  should it be booked as Transportation deal instead of a Forward ?

Ellen
Sylvia A Campos@ECT
02/23/2001 01:10 PM
No I don't.  This deal is a Physical Forward.  Usually when it pertains to a 
transportation the trader usually creates a Transportation Capacity ticket in 
Sitara.  When it hits our portfolio we would then set it up in Global 
Contracts.  

Should you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sylvia,

I'm looking into this deal and after researching it  it seems like there 
should be a separate Transportation Contract for this deal, and should not be 
confirmed by us on the Confirmation desk. Do you know anything about this 
deal or Contract ?

Eric Moon in Gas Structuring is the dealmaker and he asked me to talk to 
Darron Giron who is a book admin.
This deal relates to Tagg # EC3952  -  apparently they pulled loads of 
different transportation deals from our books and sold it on to Calpine. It 
seems to me there must be a Contract out there for this 8 year deal.

Hey folks. Just a note, Calpine Energy Services, LP deal #559974 was 
originally attached to a GTC due to the fact that the contracts group had not 
yet received the master contract. The contract was received & entered into 
Global this week & as a result we moved the above referenced deal to the 
master (Global #96056886). Transaction term information: 5/1/01 - 10/31/08.

Please reconfirm as necessary.

Thanks all!

I will attend

DG

If you have any questions about this let me know.  It will be a pain in the 
ass if the deal is between Enovate and Oneok but is then flipped to EMW to 
manage.  There will be twice as many legs and the volumes will need to be 
adusted at minimum on a monthly basis, and likely a weekly basis.  Again, let 
me know if you need anything.

DG

Enovate sold a virtual storage service to OneOk marketing.  

Transaction parameters:
MSV = 500,000 mmbtu
Daily injection \ withdraw rights = 0-25,000
enovate's demand charge = $1.75 per MSV mmbtu
Commodity charges = none
Term: Apr01 - Mar02
Location: People's Citygate

As we all know, our risk managment systems will not handle this kind of a 
transaction without al ot of manual manipulation. Below are my 
recommendations for booking this transaction.

1.  enovate should book the expected usage pattern based on the current 
market curve with a zero price (and hedge, if the trader wants) in enovate's 
MTM risk books.  The trader should periodically adjust this usage pattern as 
market conditions change.  The negative fallout from this expected usage 
should be applied against the demand charge.
 
2. As Oneok actually withdraws or injects gas into the virtual storage, we 
should record the transaction in Sitara and adjust our expected usage deal.  
The trader can hedge this position financially, physically or may be able to 
use the PGL Hub.

3. The demand charge should be booked in Tagg & Sitara and offset with 
financial annuity so we will not realize any MTM gain on the demand charge.  
We will adjust this financial annuity as losses are incurred.  Once the 
annuity is all used up, we will take all losses as incurred.  Any annuity 
amount left over at completion of the program will be taken as a gain at that 
time.

4.  This deal will be managed in the EMW book eventhough the actual 
injections\withdraws will be recorded in the enovate book.  The enovate 
physcial book will be flat - in and out at a zero price.

Cost of Carry should work in our favor unless they elect to go negative 
early.  All cash requirement should fall out in our EMW books.

Jim will build a model to determine the expected usage and track his related 
hedges (This will be similar to what Lee has, but not as complicated)

This is not intended to be a comprehensive description of how to book this 
transaction, only an outline what I believe should be reflected in our 
books.  Please forward any questions or comments to me.  Thanks.

Richard

We arrive in Denver on Saturday evening (the 10th).  We will stay that night 
and leave sometime on Sunday for Silvercreek.  We will return to Denver on 
Friday the 16th and stay the night.  Our plane back to Houston is early 
Saturday morning.  We are staying at a place in Silvercreek (I had not heard 
of this place before Kristi's friends made the plans) for 5 nights.  I think 
we want to ski there and possibly in Winter Park (it is supposed to be within 
15 miles).  How's the weather in Denver these days?  We look forward to 
seeing the two of you.  Thanks.

DG

Let me know again what the days are.  Also, let me know what you guys what
to do.  I can get lift tickets for about $43 at the grocery store.  Talk to
you later.

Sean

Sheri,
We are going to NO for JazzFest at the end of April.  April 27th-29th to be 
exact.  Let me know if you're going.
DG

	
	                           
	

Would you guys be in for an April b'day trip to New Orleans?  These flights 
are dirt cheap.  Thought maybe just fly up late morning on a Sat and come 
back Sun morning.  We need to move pretty quick though....

I have 3 new employees and they are working on the first unit.  My 3 existing 
employees are working on their second and third.  So far so good.  I think it 
is good that we have put the responsibility on them to learn the material.  I 
have not heard of any negative response.  I'll keep you posted.

Any feedback??

Jeff,
I was curious to find out how everyone was doing with the training 
program.    Frank will be following up at your next meeting.   How are the 
managers and the new hires coming along with the completion of monthly 
modules?
Any feedback from them?
Thanks,

This evening, the new improved bridge monitor will be migrated to the EOL 
production environment.  Several new enhancements were created to make this 
application more efficient.  Such as:

1.  The bridge will handle 20 messages/second, instead of processing 1 
message/second.
2.  The screens will no longer jump around! (Yeah)  You can select and view a 
transaction without having the screen update with new deals.
3.  Historical deal query - ability to select and process historical dates 
very quickly.
4.  Sorting capability - you can query any of the eight column headers by 
selecting the column and typing a risk book, trans. id, deal capture system, 
etc. and it  will filter to that section.

Please forward this e-mail to your groups.  If you have any questions or 
concerns with the new bridge monitor please contact me at 3-9353 or Tara at 
3-4523.  We hope this helps, I know it has made our lives easier while 
testing.  Also, feedback is much appreciated!

Thanks,
Dawn

I am working on OA for phase II Dec prod.  It looks like there are 
liquidations on the buy side that equal the variance on the sales side for 
the above ref counterparty.  Look at NW9561.2 and NX4842.2.  Is it okay to 
assume that these liquidations belong on the  purchase side.  This is for the 
west region.

Call if you have questions.

Thanks!

	
	

Sorry for the late notice on this one.  
Can you provide MTM values as of Dec 29, 2000, for the short name of CROSS 
TIMBERS.

Thanks again,

How goes it?  I wanted to check in with you and make sure we are still on for 
March.  I also need to let you know we will have an extra person besides the 
four of us.  He is the kid of some people who are driving up and is flying 
with us.  I hope this is OK.  He can acutally babysit so maybe we can go out 
one night.  Let me know.  Also,  I just hired a KU kid just out of undergrad 
school.  He's pretty bummed out about Baylor.  Talk to you soon.

I just looked at their sight.  They seem like a reputable company.  It's a 
store in Manhattan, NY.  The only thing to be concerned about when ordering 
by phone or online is when there is a problem with the unit.  It is more of a 
pain in the ass to mail it back than to just take it to Circuit City or Best 
Buy.  But a Sony DVD is very reliable and you should not have a problem.  I'd 
pull the trigger, that's a great price.

Mike Fultz <Mike.Fultz@HALLIBURTON.com> on 02/12/2001 03:09:08 PM
Darron,

I am ready to purchase the Sony C670D DVD Player.  I have gone thru CNET.com
and found a three star (highest rating) certified CNET dealer that sells it
for $340  - Tweeter has it for $449 + tax and Circuit City and Best Buy
don't carry this model.  The name of the Internet company is
moreaudiovideo.com.

Did you order yours off the internet and if so from whom?  I am a little
weary about buying something like this off the internet...

Edie, Darren, further to our conversation.  The only reporting that I would 
like to send upstairs is broken down into two categories.  West Gas Trading, 
and West Gas Origination.  All orig ( even Denver ) is coded to 107321. 
Inside of west gas orig we have created a tracking mechanism through Darren, 
that provides a seperate report broken down by individual or group but I am 
the only person who needs this data for right now.

Edie, please ensure that on a go forward basis that the actualized income 
streams have been coded in the proper places and that we do not double count 
again.  

Call if any questions.

BT 

The originations below were granted to Barry Tycholiz in January.  Per Barry, 
these originations should have been granted to him through "West Gas 
Origination" rather than "Middle Market - West".  Please make these 
corrections in February in order to correct the NG P&L for the quarter.  
Thanks for your help!  Please call me with any questions.

Thanks,

A husband and wife want to take golf lessons from a pro at a local country
club. The man and woman meet the pro and head onto the driving range. The
man goes up to hit first. He swings and hits the ball 100 yards. The golf
pro says not bad. Golfpro: "Now hold the club as firm as you hold your
wife's breasts". The man follows instructions and hits the ball 300 yards.
The golf pro says "Excellent!" Now the woman takes her turn. Her ball goes
30 yards. Golfpro: "Not bad, try holding the club like you hold your
husbands penis." She swings and the ball goes 10 yards. Golfpro: "Not bad,
but now try taking the club out of your mouth and hit the ball."

	
	                           
	

How are you feeling?  I'm very tired and stiff.  I've been thinking, and I 
know you feel like I make all of the decisions around our house when it comes 
to $.  So I want us to do what you want on the pool and a car when it comes 
to financing.  I will completely agree with whatever you think we should do.  
And I'm not doing this for any other reason except that I want you to know 
that I value your judgement and ideas.  Have a great day.  As always, I love 
you very much.

I will be able to interview at either time.  I selected the late time on the 
email, but wanted to respond to make sure you received it.

DG

Darron, David, please respond to Jana in regards to the times that you will 
be available to interview candidates.

	

All,

The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that 
need to be addressed immediately.  While we anticipate many new Analysts 
joining Enron this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it 
necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off-Cycle Recruiting 
event.  We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting 
approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed.  I am asking that you forward 
this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above).  We will conduct 
first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the 
afternoon.  We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning 
(9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session.  Please submit your 
response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date.  If 
you are currently on the new Outlook program, you may not be able to use the 
buttons below.  In that instance, please contact me at x39233 to volunteer.  

In addition, we have a need within one of Enron's business units for 
accounting majors.  We will be bringing several people in to interview with 
accounting backgrounds.  We will then make sure that the schedule will be set 
so you would interview these specific candidates.  We would greatly 
appreciate your assistance in this effort.  Thanks in advance for your 
cooperation.

  

Thank you,
Jana

	
	

Please forward to Ellen Wallumrod the MTM valuation(mini-book) for all 
CoEnergy Trading Company deals as of Dec 31, 2000.  If you can export into 
excel and forward by e-mail, that would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Joe

Joe,

Call Pat Ryder for West desk requests.

DG

   
	
	

Jeff, 
Thanks for the lead with Avril Forster, it looks like that will help us in 
the near future.  Until we can get EnTelligence built to our specifications, 
we'll need to continue to go to the different desks to provide Mark-to-Market 
valuations for a Counterparty's portfolio.

Desk heads,

Can you provide to Ellen and myself the names of the person on your desk who 
we should go to with these requests.  Also, please let these persons know 
that we will be coming to them often with these requests (we recieve several 
per week).

Here's the background of these requests.  Because of various accounting 
rules, Parties dealing in Derivatives must show third party valuations to 
their Auditors.  Our group (Confirmations) is responsible for providing MTM 
values and open position reports for these parties.  We do not have access to 
any system that values these deals, but are looking to get the on-line 
"EnTelligence" built so that it carries back-dated curves that will allow us 
to complete these requests without taking up a Risk person's time and without 
having to black out information (Delta/Vol) that is included in a mini-book.

Thanks for the help.  We'll try to get these off of your plates as soon as 
possible.

Joe

	
	                           
	

	
	                           
	

Kam,

Jim called me about this and I asked him to email me.  But all these storage 
facilities are on the East desk.

DG
	
	

Per our conversation, please advise as to what GD index Enron would use to 
value physical storage on the following East pipes:

Cove Point - I think it is in Maryland.  Acquired from CES
National Fuel -
Tennessee - which of the many indices
Napoleonville - 
Transco - which of the many indices

Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.  I need this for 
our auditors.

Thanks.

Troy,

I'm out of the office this morning.  I'll get back to you later about the 
variance.  But just so you know, Kevin's reported P&L was understated by the 
$188K on the OA Flash tab.  He made an error in the sharing calculation.

DG

Shawn,

Unfortunately, I am out of the office this morning with a sick kid.  I will 
not be able to make the 10:30am interview.  I appologize for the short notice.

need to settle with ECC, not ENA.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.

Hello.
I received an invoice from Eagan Enterprises for Maintenance Kit for HP 
LaserJet 8100N.
Have you received this merchandise?
Please advise.

	
	                           
	

Prior to her trip to Texas, Buffy (a New Yorker) confided to her
sorority sisters she had three goals for her trip to the Lone Star
State.
She wanted to taste some real Texas Bar B Que, take in a bona fide
rodeo and
have sex with a cowboy.  Upon her return, her sorority sisters
were
curious as to how she fared.

Let me tell you, they have a tree down there called mesquite and
when  they slow cook that brisket over that mesquite, oh so
good!!!!
The taste is unbelievable!!!  I went to a real rodeo. Talk about
athletes,
these guys wrestle  real full-grown bulls- like in Spain.  Except
they
ride a horse out at full gallop, then jump off the horses and
literally
grab the bulls by the horns  and throw them to the ground.  It is
incredible!
They then asked, " Well tell us, did you have sex with a cowboy?"
Are you kidding?  Once I saw the outline of the condom they carry
around
in the back pocket of their jeans, I changed my mind!!!!

                 

	
	                           
	

I apologize for the delay on the distribution, as we had systems issues.

Please contact Walter Guidroz at x5-3595 if you have any questions on the 
Aquila COLW deal.

Jay,

I changed the FTS monthly amount from $1,065 to $715 as previously 
discussed.  It is effective Feb 20th.  I need to change the amount 
transferred to account  586-61L86 from $150 to $175 and to account 586-61M19 
from $175 to $200.  I also submitted a transfer of $1,000 into my CMA 
account.  I would like to transfer $500 each into account 586-94017 and 
account 586-94019.  This is my 2001 contribution to the Education IRA's.  Let 
me know if I need to do anything else.  Also, when are the 
recharacterizations from Roth to Traditional going to take place?  I will 
need a 1099-R for the transactions I think.  Call me if you have any 
questions.  Thanks.

Hey ya'll,

Please reply when your last day file is complete and don't forget to provide

Also, will you cc Jim Little in Gas Accounting so he can initiate processes 
in his group.

Thanks for all your help this month,

I wanted to see if the address worked.  We had a good time in NO.  We 
definitely want to go back.  It was really crowded, but fun.  The weather was 
good and the food was great.  How is DC?  Have you seen any of the sights 
yet?  

I wanted to ask if you can help with C&C on the 16th and 17th of May when we 
are in Chicago.  I know your schedule just got alot more hectic, so let me 
know.  They can stay in Conroe on Fri and Sat.  We leave Wed night and return 
Sun morning.  It would mean be staying at our house on those nights and 
getting them to school.  If you can't, we will try to get one of the 
neighbors.  

Thanks.  See you when you get back.

You and your brother need to think about the sept trip to Estes Park...I 
want  
to make reservations soon. ?I realize that you already have a trip planned 
to  
CO this year, ?and am not sure if your KS cousins will even be there, but we  
need to talk about this. ?Lar and I are going irregardless of who goes...the

Just a quick reminder to please go into your books and flip all the ECC deals 
to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book by the end of today for both January and February 
start dates.

I've shown Sherry Dawson a quick way of finding deals that might be missed in 
TAGG, so please see her if you have questions on this.

Please let me know when all the January deals have been fixed so I can start 
the invoicing process.  

Thanks for your help.

Any word on her review?  Let me know.  Thanks.

Greg,
I got confirmation from the Head Coach at JV that AR is not going to UT. He 
scored a 760 on his SAT and apparently overslept a retake exam.  So I don't 
know if they actually pulled the offer, but it sure sounds like it.  Either 
way, the coach told my wife he will not be a Horn.  The coach is really 
dissapointed in AR.

For your enjoyment...
This author of this little story should go to Washington.

"A Republican and a Democrat were walking down the street when they came to
a homeless person. The republican gave the homeless person his business card
and told him to come to his business for a job. He then took twenty dollars
out of his pocket and gave it to the homeless person.

The Democrat was very impressed, and when they came to another homeless
person, he decided to help.
He walked over to the homeless person and gave him directions to the welfare
office. He then reached into the Republican's pocket and gave him fifty
dollars."

It may be hard for some people to figure out the real differences between
Democrats and Republicans, and this little story says it all.

I don't know.  She just told me this morning and I hadn't heard about it.  I 
told her to get more info.  I don't know if he is a good student or not.

DG

Greg_Carrow@valic.com on 01/26/2001 01:42:03 PM
Man, that's news to me.  Is it a grade problem?  Or is he waffling (is OU
out there)?  That's huge.  Let me know what you find out.

Thanks

Darron.C.Giron@enron.com on 01/26/2001 01:38:49 PM

My wife told me that UT pulled the offer from Robinson.  Do you know about
this?  I couldn't find it on the boards.
DG

Greg_Carrow@valic.com on 01/26/2001 01:29:46 PM

Hey Darron, just been working on year-end stuff here.  Too many late
nights.  I have been keeping up with recruiting.  The guy from Jersey
Village is Abe Robinson, a  O-lineman, TE prospect.  He will probably play
offenseive tackle (6'5" -260 - 4.9) and is a top 10-15 prospect in the
state.  Texas will have a top 5 recruiting class but the problem is that OU
will possible have the top 1 or 2 class and have signed the top defensive
player in Texas, Tommie Harris.   A&M is the odd man out in the mix because
of the emergence of OU and LSU.   A&M is going back to pre-Sherrill days.
I would think they will be looking for a new coach next year.

Let's try to get together soon.  Maybe have lunch or something.

Talk to you soon

Darron.C.Giron@enron.com on 01/26/2001 12:23:52 PM

Hey,
What's going on?  I wanted to get up to date on recruiting.  I also wanted
to ask you something.  I heard some info from my wife regarding a kid that
was recruited and commited to UT from Jersey Village.

Lunch still good for you guys?  Anytime is good for me, but noon or after
would be better, if this meeting runs late.  What time is good for you
guys?  Also, suggestions for where would be good.  It probably needs to be
central downtown since Giron is on the south side.  Let me know.

Bring him in

These all need to be flipped to settle in the FT-US/CAND-ERMS books like the 
rest of these deals.  I've spoken to Jennifer Denny with EOL about getting a 
program set up for Duke deals similar to ones we have with TransCanada Energy 
and Dynegy Canada so they automatically get booked to settle with ECC, but I 
don't think this has happened yet.  Please go through your books to make sure 
that no Duke deals have been missed.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.

Thanks for all your help

In order for the physical desks to roll out positions into TDS,  a mapping is 
required between the Org region code used in Portcalc
for the physical calc and the related Tagg book code that is used for that 
region.

An example would be similar to:

Org Region Code                             Tagg Book Code
CENTRAGULF                                  
FT-INTRA-GULF                        This is just an example and might not be 
a valid grouping

 TDS knows the Tagg books to pick up, it just does not know which physical 
region codes that are related to it.

Can you provide for your desk all Org Region Codes used on your desk, and 
what Tagg Book it would relate to.
If you could send me the list, I will forward them to the TDS developers.

Any questions or concerns, please call me.

Thanks

We have had a few recent instances where deals have been unwound in TAGG and 
not in Sitara.  This, has,  in all cases resulted in a negative financial 
impact.  Going forward,  no long-term physical deals will be unwound without 
my signature,  and that of the physical trader responsible for trading the 
area for which the deal was done.  Also,  all unwind tickets will require  
the old TAGG and Sitara deal number to be written on the ticket.

Mike,
DVD time huh?  I like my player, but there is a substantial premium for it.  
And actually, Sony has come out with the next evolution of the mega DVD 
changer.  I think it lists for $900, but can probably be had for $600-$700 
range.  It is also huge.  I'm not trying to talk you out of it, just let you 
know of the downside.  Both models have identical specs, so quality is not an 
issue.  Let me know if you have anymore questions.

Darron,

What is going on??  Not much here...same old same old.  How is the Mustang
running?  Looks like I will be getting rid of the TA within the next month
or two.  I have been looking pretty hard at Tahoe's and finally have a firm
price to work with.  Anyway, it is about time to get my DVD player and I was
wondering if you are happy with your 200 disc DVD Player.  I can get it off
the internet for ~$400 or I can get Scott's for ~$275.  Sony has released
their next generation of DVD  - I think the 'S' series.  There is one that
is designed to match the Wega tv's.  It is a single disc and costs about
$330 on the internet.  I am not exactly sure what the differences between
the new 'S' series and the 'C' series are.  I don't know if I should get the
new one and pay the extra money or just get an older model.

See if this works.

DG

Darron:

I understand from Chris Abel that the deals contained within this book were 
transferred to a new book.  Would that be the FT-Lonestar book recently 
created?  If so, did you calc and officialize the book one last time to 
insure that the positions are zeroed out for credit purposes?  If you did 
not, can you please do so.  You can make the effective date the 19th as that 
is the day the deals were moved to a new book.  It necessary for you to calc 
and officialize one last time as the Credit system looks back at the last day 
officialized to pick up credit information.  This will insure that duplicate 
datat is not present for credit.

Thanks for you help in this matter.

Regards,

Nancy

See if this works.

Make sure your group is looking out for this.  

1. If copying post ids to run mini books they need to take the TDS flag off
2.  Since not everyone will do #1 - they should watch their position loads to 
make sure they are bringing in the correct post ids (they are listed in the 
load statement)   After they have closed this screen there isn't a way of 
seeing this.

Note I have changed working hours & currently come during lunch.  If you have 
questions concerning TDS systems call Bill Fortney x39952, or you can talk to 
Russ Severson.

Thanks,
Bill

The PortCalc screen has been changed in production to copy the TDS position 
load flag as is,
instead of setting it to 0.

It seems after some discussion the prevailing wisdom is to change the way the 
TDS flag works when copying a Post ID.

Risk would like to have the TDS flag copy to new Post IDs.  

Please make the change when possible.  I would put the Meta Calc having the 
flag a higher priority.

Thanks,

Bill

The TDS position load flag has been added to the PortCalc screen in
production. Please close your PortCalcs screens and bring up new ones 
to access this feature.

(The field is labelled TDS, and is located in the middle, left side of the 
screen.)

Thank you,
Jeremy

Jeremy Wong will be moving the TDS position load flag onto the Port Calc 
screen Thursday morning.  

Kenny Ha will then move the new release of TDS to use this flag into 
production Thursday night.  

Risk will have to flag their books with the new flag Thursday night so the 
trader positions will load correctly into TDS for Friday.  I will talk to 
everyone about the change on Thursday & send out a notice of other changes.

As part of our monthly testing we review the monthly Natural Gas P & L 
Statement and identify specific regions for which we would like to review 
additional documentation.  Please find below, the regions that we have 
identified.  We are requesting that you supply the P & L top pages for the 
last day of the month for those regions that are applicable to you.  Once we 
have reviewed these top pages, we will be contacting you to discuss the 
drivers of these regions.  Please let me know if you have any questions or 
comments.

Thank You,

This is a physical deal.  Leg 4 is unwinding Leg 1.  Leg 1 had the Price and 
Basis components and Leg 3 had the Index component.  I am in Chicago today 
and tomorrow.  If you have any further questions, please let me know.

DG

   

Darron:

Leg 4 of this deal is in TAGG as a physical swap instead of a physical 
forward.  Is this a physical or financial deal?

Thank you:

Bill,

I need to have FT-DENVER set up in TDS.  The trader is Jay Reitmeyer.  There 
are two Tagg books that need to be mapped to this:  FT-DENVER and 
INTRA-DENVER.  The following people in Risk need access to the book:  Darron 
Giron, Chris Walker, Pat Ryder, Jason Wolfe, Carole Frank, Anne Bike, and 
Jennifer Bagwell.  I also want it to roll up into ALL-WEST.  Call me if you 
have any questions.  Thanks for your help.

To set up the Denver desk in TDS send a message to Bill Fortney with the 
following:

What to call it in TDS (it can be different than TAGG)
The names of the TAGG books to map to it
Who needs access
A roll up desk if needed.  Does it need to be added to ALL-WEST, have a 
different roll up or doesn't need a roll-up desk at all.

Any questions give me a call x5-7579 or Bill Fortney x3-9952

We have two new Analysts in this group, and therefore should probably go to 
this.  I nominate the two of you.

 I appreciate everyone's help in making sure that all the information for 
Lagrasta's originated is deals is accurate.  He is now receiving a daily 
report with all originated deals.  

 He has also asked that we give him the data on the deals that his group has 
done that do not have origination.  Therefore,  going forward we will need to 
put all deals for Lagrasta's group into the origination file.  Meaning,  if 
his group does a deal where no origination is granted,  you will need to put 
all the relevant information into the origination file and just put a $0 for 
the Origination granted on the report.  Thanks so much for your help.

Attached is the file containing details for the Financial Liquidations 
relating to Physical Index trades.  Thanks to Troy and Jim, we have 
eliminated the duplication of the intra-month transport liquidations in the 
daily P/L.  The Liquidations for transport that are included below are 
positions that must be rolled out of my intra-month book and into the FT-West 
P/L.  The offsetting liquidations should be coming through Chris Walker's 
Financial Liquidations Process.   We are still unable to provide support out 
of ERMS for the liquidations relating to transport.  I have included the 
values for all of the intra-month December Liquidations below.

So you are going to play hardball are you?  I understand you situation.  I 
didn't know all of your guys were leaving tomorrow (literally!) Yeah, hold on 
to him.  I think he's good for Risk.  

Dave

   

Believe me, I understand why you want him in your group.  But I lose Jennifer 
on Jan 24th and Chris on Jan 26th.  You have two months on one guy and six on 
the other.  I have 3 weeks on two people and Jason will be leaving soon 
because he is in the new trading track program.  I don't want to be an 
asshole, but I won't give him up unless I'm forced to.

   

I want Pat back in this group.  After the sale of this company, they are 
still going to make a go at having a Texas desk.  Denver is rotating in about 
6 months and Jody is rotating in two months.  I will help you find more 
talent.  What do you think?

like to hire a candidate just out of college if possible.  Thanks for your 
help.

I agree.  The honeymoon will be over begining next season.  I am growing 
weary of teams "tricking" us early in games.  Too me, that translates to 
"outcoached".  Maybe I'm being unreasonable, but they should have the talent 
next year.  We'll see.  You had to love OSU kicking the shit out of the 
domers.  Looks like Erickson has brought the thug factor back into college

Hi,

Just a friendly reminder for you to please go through all your books to make 
sure
there aren't any deals between ECC and a third counterparty.  If there are, 
please
flip them to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book right away.  Especially those deals that
are Nymex vs. a fixed price for January 2001, these need to be invoiced 
tomorrow.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this matter.

Thanks for your help
Stacey

The $1.7M is in Jim's book.  He asked me to hold it back because he thought 
the curve for ChiGate was set too high and he was making too much on Friday.  
I think the $ is real, and it will be released before year end.

I don't know about the annuity.  Kevin will return tomorrow and he will have 
to follow up with you.  I'll send the prior day P&L's tonight.

DG

Can you guys confirm that we have $1.7 million top-leveled to allow for the 
NGPL ITS losses that we have not put into the books yets?  We need to put 
these losses in on Thursday or friday.

Also did we reverse the $326000 annuity and subsequent origination out of my 
bookes and the FT-cental books?  We should have a new annuity to PGL for the 
same amount.

Can you send me a copy of the top page for enovate for last Friday and 
Thursday like the one you sent me today for Monday's top page?

Call me if you have any questions at 312.925.8906

Richard

OK,
NG5405.1 instead of NG5401.1
NW7984.1 instead of E22563.6

Questions:

What does being short/long a position mean?
What is curve shift?
What affects curve shift?
What are the basic components of a P&L?
What is a swap?
What are different types of swaps?
What is basis?
What is MTM value?
What is Accrual value?
What do you consider stress in the workplace?  How do you handle stress?  
Examples of a stressful situation?
What do you consider long work hours?

Some aren't technical.  I don't have any problem solving questions.

DG
	
	

I also do not have many tech questions.  I look for trainability as well.  

My questions:
-What do you know about the commodities market?
-Do you do any online trading, if so what, and why - looking for trading of 
options,  stocks, futs, etc for more difficult follow-up questions like
    why options, not buy/sell the underlying.  How do you determine what to 
trade and when, how long do you hold it.  Also looking for how often they 
play        on the internet and whether they do it at work.  
-What do you know about the industry?  How many units in a contract?  How do 
you hedge physical gas?  Financial positions?  
-What is V@R?  Not looking for a technical answer, just if they are familiar 
with the concept?  What other trading controls do they expect to be in place?
-How well do you handle ridicule?  (Always looking for a certain central 
trader's new lackey)
-How well versed are you in Excel?  What have you done where you are using 
excel to improve your work product?  How did you learn it?  Have you shared 
it with anyone else?  What other improvements have you made?  Would you give 
me a name of a person I could verify the impact this has had in your current 
organization?  (I don't ever call, I just am looking to see if there answer 
is the truth and what kind of ego they have) 
-Further educational goals?  MBA, CFA,  - looking for goals and motivators.
-Are you easily incited to violence?

WK

I do not have very many technical questions but here a the few that I have 
used:

- Do you understand what curveshift is?  If so ... Price today was $10.20 and 
yesterday it was $10.13 ... what was my curveshift?
- What makes up a P&L statement?
- What is MTM accounting?  accrual accounting?
- If they have knowledge of options, what is a delta position?

I guess these are more general analytical questions:

- Give me an example of an problem you've had and how you solved it?
- The "eight ball" question (basic problem solving)
- The "light switch" question (advanced problem solving)

When I interview I am looking for trainability, better than average problem 
solving skills and a desire to work in this environment.  If the candidate 
has these skills then I believe we can teach them what they need to know.  I 
also think it is candidates with these basic attributes that are a better fit 
for us.  They know they don't know everything (about Risk) and work hard to 
get up to speed. 

Dave

could you please forward this to your intra-month book admins.
Thanks

The OA group has had many problems in the past with our desk level summaries 
and the break-outs between our books.  Some of the short names get cut off 
and it is hard to tell exactly what books they belong to.  Could you please 
make sure that the values are input on the correct lines, that there is only 
one line per desk and that there are no numbers without a desk assigned to 
them.  Some of the problems they have run into with SAP and the "seller 
rules" is that if both desks do not show the same numbers the seller side is 
assumed to be correct which throws off the other side and gives them an 
adjustment for the desk to take which isn't always correct.   

Here is a list of the desks that are most often misused.

ECT-ENA - IM CE  central desk
ECT-ENA - IM MI  central desk
ECT-ENA - IM MK  central desk
ECT-ENA - IM MA  market east deak
ECT-ENA - IM SI  sithe desk
ECT-EMW - IM MI  enron midwest desk

Please pay special attention to your numbers this month.  Getting this 
corrected up front will take care of a lot of work in the future. 
Please ask me if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kam

You have 1 employee who fell out in  "Needs Improvement" at the year end 2000 
PRC process. 

I would like to meet with you to address the employee's areas of 
improvement.  Additionally, I will be sitting in on your discussion with the 
employee. My role will be twofold:

assist you in creating a communication and development plan for the employee
to serve as an advocate for the employee and management

As agreed, We will not be sitting in with employees who were placed in "Needs 
Improvement" due to newest in position. Specifically, employees who are 
meeting your learning curve expectations but because of their newest and 
limited contributions they were placed in "Needs Improvement".

You should plan to discuss your development plan with your employee(s) 
between now and January 31, 2001. 

Please contact me prior to meeting with the employee so I can assist with 
your plans. Call if you have any questions, I can be reached on (713) 
345-3662.

Jim,

I didn't top level that amount tonight.  The Central desk has the other side 
of the transaction and if I backed your portion out, then the loss would be 
double counted.  It will correct itself tomorrow.

see if we could come by and see you.  It would most likely be on the 10th and 
then the 16th.  We are staying at a place from that Sunday night thru 
Thursday night.  Let me know.  I hope Santa was good to you all.

I just wanted to pass along my thanks for the efforts of your team.  The 
automatic bridge to Sitara and Tagg will save us an extraordinary amount of 
time; especially during bidweek.  I know there are others who deserve thanks 
in addition to Dawn, so please let them know we appreciate their hard work as 
well.  I don't want to seem greedy, but I'll ask anyway.  When do you think 
we will be able to get the Sitara number entered in the Link field in Tagg?  
Also, can we get the Tagg number entered in SCI?  Thanks again.

Dawn:  Thank you so much for all of your hard work in getting these physical 
products to bridge correctly.  You have saved us a tremendous amount of 
work.  I know that there were a ton of little details that went into getting 
these products done correctly.  Everything went smoothly, and the bridge 
worked the first time.  We really appreciate your efforts.

Darron,

Could you tell me what my unaccounted balance is as well.  I am working with 
Cora P to make it zero.  Also could you email the P&L number to 
jhsim@juno.com.

Thanks Darron,
I'm just alittle nervous.  I am flying solo and it was a big number.  Almost 
too good to be true.

It would help if I attached the file.

We can now calc at home/on the laptops.  After you dial in,( connect to 
remoteservices.enron.com and log in), select start/programs/trading/xterm off 
of the menu.  Xterm will bring up a window ... type in runm.  After that it 
is calcing as normal.  From what I can tell it works okay.  Let me know if 
you have any problems.

Please make sure that all physical deals with a finacial component are marked 
physical in TAGG.  Mostly this applies to annuities associated with physical 
deals and imbedded options.   Not clicking physical is causing problems with 
accounting as well as the credit group.

Burton,
The following spreadsheets were still loaded from the ng_directory. Rock did 
call me saying that some pipe option spreadsheets were not loading through 
the new process and when I checked it seemed like a network problem and asked 
him to run it again and it seemed to be OK.

With the new process, there is no need for double quotes around the curve 
code and counterparty code columns anymore. This has been automatically taken 
care of since we process from the spreadsheet itself. This was the original 
problem around the pipe option spreadsheets which we discovered yesterday and 
the reason why the numbers did not match between the old and new processes.

I also noticed that INTRA-NORTHEAST-PHY was officialised 4 times - 2 times in 
a row in quick succcession.

I would like Rock or Robin to load these spreadsheets once again during the 
day with Virendra or me as early as possible. We have been consistently been 
able to load these into the test data bases.

The ng spreadsheet also has a quoted price curve code. It should not take any 
time to convert these spreadsheets over.

The ft_northwest sheet seems to be fine - just that it was put into the ng 
directory. Please advise them not to use this directory anymore. Any NT based 
directory will give much better response.

The surprises are the rll and the plastics text files. I thought these were 
the first to go the new spreadsheet format.

Brian Gillis was able to load his spreadsheets successfully through terminal 
server from Calgary yesterday.

Regards,
Ramesh

We have new book names in TAGG for our intramonth portfolios and it is 
extremely important that any deal booked to the East is communicated quickly 
to someone on my team.  I know it will take some time for the new names to 
sink in and I do not want us to miss any positions or P&L.  

Thanks for your help on this.

I just would not want to be the only person to bring someone.  So if we don't 
offer this to everyone, I won't bring her.  I don't have a problem with it, 
just wanted to see what you thought.

DG

   

What would you think about just Kristi coming?  I'm sure no one would have 
any problems with that.  Especially since they got to bring someone to the 
party last weekend.  Jeff is going too, I asked him about the budget and he 
is totally fine with that.  Have people been asking if they can bring someone?

  

I want to run something by you.  It sounds like we have some sort of budget 
for Friday night.  I would like to offer everyone the opportunity to bring 
someone with them but also explain that we may not be able to pay for it 
all.  I guess the reason is I would like to have Kristi come with me, but am 
willing to pay for her.  I would like to do the same for everyone else, but 
don't want to offend anyone with the possibility that they may have to pay a 
little $$.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.

When Gas Daily curves are created in ERMS, the rate server group has told me 
that the GDP designated curves should be those that are 
actually  published, that they can get an outside feed to pull in the rates.  
Internally created curves used for gas daily purposes should be 
designated as a GDC curve.  If curves created in the future could follow this 
naming convention it would make the curve names more meaningful.

Normal GDP curves need to be set up by the global rate server group, dummy 
internal curves can be set up in global by us.

Any questions, please give me a call.

Found this on a web site.

The Gelaendewagen or "G-wagen" is something of a Land Rover on steroids with 
German engineering. 
Think of a cross between an S500 sedan and the Hummer. At $135,000 a copy and 
with only a handful being 
imported into the US, those lucky enough to get their hands on a G-Wagen are 
assured exclusivity and an 
all-terrain vehicle that means business.

Please read.  Thanks.

Please forward this to your groups. Thanks.
In the past few months much focus has been put on understanding VAR and how 
it is calculated (through RisktRAC).  However, everyone should note that the 
credit department also receives our information.  Market risk and credit risk 
are inherently different, with different requirements.  This memo serves as a 
reminder of what some of the key differences are, how the credit system uses 
RisktRAC differently from market risk, how this affects us, what some key 
problems are in the credit system caused by our data, and changes to be made 
by risk management groups.

differences are between credit and market risk - you all know this, but many 
of your ba's don't. 
when a book is flat it still has an effect on credit.  Flat books must be 
officialized
market risk is keyed off positions and curves.  When we make money, market 
risk is reduced.  Credit risk is keyed off positions with customers.  When we 
make money, credit risk is increased, as people owe us more money.

how the credit system uses RisktRAC differently from market risk
Market risk picks up all officialized books.  If a book is not officialized 
it does not pick the book up.
Credit picks up all officalized books.  If a book is not officialized, it 
picks up the previous day's position.  Therefore, if positions in book A are 
moved to book B, and A is no longer officialized, credit picks up the 
previous day's position for book A.  As a result, if a book is no longer 
used, please officialize it the first day it is no longer used, so credit 
will pick up 0 on a go forward basis.
Market risk is not concerned with counterparty codes and names.
Credit needs correct counterparty codes and names.  In recent months, the 
counterparty information has deteriorated.  Enron official counterparty names 
need to be used so they flow properly to credit.

what are some key problems in the credit system caused by our data
As referenced above: correct counterparty names and books with 0 positions 
not being officialized so credit picks up previous day info.
As a takeaway from this message please ensure only correct counterparty names 
are used and that if a book has 0 positions that it is officialized the first 
day it has 0 positions.

If you have specific questions about credit, please call Debbie Brackett, at 
X35856.

In the past few months, the procedures for setting up new curves and books 
have not been followed by everyone. 

The following memo documents the procedures to 1) set up a new curve, 2) set 
up a new book, and 3) change a portfolio hierarchy.  Please note that risk 
management (for each commodity group), "risk management"  is responsible for 
ensuring that information is flowing appropriately between the valuation 
systems and RisktRAC (Risk Analysis and Reporting can help, but do not have 
all of the ERMS information to be able to ensure the completeness of 
RisktRAC).

I have attached the request form for each of these changes at the bottom of 
this memo.  Please ensure that everyone in your group obtains a copy. 

The procedure to set up a new curve is as follows:

Trader starts trading at a new location or a new commodity and needs a new 
curve set up
Trader communicates this to risk management
Risk management constructs new curve in ERMS (with the help of the IT 
department)
Risk management completes a curve set up request form to set up curve in 
RisktRAC
Curve form is forwarded to Risk Analysis and Reporting
Risk Analysis and Reporting sets up curve in RisktRAC
A system generated message is sent to people on the "curve list" indicating a 
change in the RisktRAC curves has been made

If the curve is not set up in RisktRAC the positions are not captured in the 
VAR or engine, thereby making VAR inaccurate.  As a side note, Risk Analysis 
and Reporting has implemented a new process in which on a weekly basis new 
curves set up in ERMS are reviewed to ensure that these have been set up in 
RisktRAC.  We did this for the first time today and noted numerous curves in 
ERMS that are not in RisktRAC - which we are working with you to resolve.

The procedure to set up a new book in RisktRAC is as follows:

Trader/risk management determines new book is needed
New book request form (for RisktRAC) is completed by risk management
New book request form is forwarded to Risk Analysis and Reporting
Risk Analysis and Reporting sets up book in RisktRAC
Risk Analysis and Reporting forwards request to ERMS administrator and global 
counterparty group to request that book is set up in valuation and 
counterparty systems
Once all groups have completed their individual set ups, a final e-mail is 
sent to personnel on the "books list" and the book administrator in the risk 
management department who requested the book

It is important that there is a one to one link between the ERMS and RisktRAC 
books, or not all positions will be captured in RisktRAC (two commodities per 
ERMS book does not flow properly into RisktRAC).

The above two processes have formally existed for a number of months.  
Additionally, we are formalizing the procedure for changing portfolio 
hierarchies.  The procedure now is:

Risk management is responsible for requesting all portfolio hierarchy 
changes.  Previously, changes could be made through a request by Risk 
Analysis and Reporting or RAC.  These two groups are no longer allowed to 
submit change requests.  All requests must come through risk management.
Risk management completes a request, including the reason for the requested 
change in structure
Risk management forwards the request to Risk Analysis and Reporting
Risk Analysis and Reporting makes the change and notifies risk management 
that the change has been made.

If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please call: me X39123, 
Chris Abel X33012, Burton McIntyre X57197, or Susan Trevino X31462.

Thanks,

Shona

Gary and I are going to have a "get together" before the Holiday Party on 
Saturday, December 9th.  Please let me know if you want to stop by our place 
before we head out to Enron Field.  We live really only a few miles away from 
downtown, so this could be a good pit stop for all of you that live out in 
the "burbs"!   (No names mentioned).  

Anyway, let me know if you are able to come by and I will give you directions 
to our place.  Hope all of you can make it!

Thanks,
Dawn

This is the last deal that is in the FT-Norhtwest book that needs to be
flipped into the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book, to settle between ECC and
Duke Energy Marketing Limited Partnership.  This needs to be fixed so
liquidations will be correct for Novmeber.

There seems to be some confusion about this deal, so please call me
or Greg Carraway about this deal, and maybe we can answer questions
if there are any.

Thanks
Stacey

Happy Birthday!!
What did you get?

DG

Stacy, I see you as more of an over 60, except for the admiration part.

This is a fun diversion.

Take this test for yourself...and send it to your friends, including me, and
let them know who you are. My score is in the subject box... Don't peek but
begin the test as you scroll down and answer.

Answers are for who you are now...not who you were in the past.   Have pen
or pencil and paper ready.   This is a real test given by the Human
Relations Dept at many of  the major corporations today. It helps them get a
better insight concerning their employees and potential employees.

It's only 10 simple questions, so...  Grab a pencil and paper, keeping track
of your letter answers.   Make sure you change the subject of the e-mail to
read YOUR total. When you are finished, forward this to everyone you know,
and also send  it to the person who sent this to you.

Make sure to put YOUR score in the subject box.  Ready?? Begin...

 10.(a) 4
 (b) 2
 (c) 3
 (d) 5
 (e) 6
 (f) 1

Now add up the total number of points.
OVER 60 POINTS:
Others see you as someone they should "handle with
care." You're  seen
as
vain, self-centered, and who is extremely dominant.
Others may admire
you,
wishing they could be more like you, but don't always
trust you,
hesitating to become too deeply involved with you.

 51 TO 60 POINTS:
Others see you as an exciting, highly volatile, rather
impulsive
personality; a natural leader, who's quick to take
decisions,  though not
always the  right ones. They see you as bold and
adventuresome, someone
who will try anything once; someone who takes chances
and enjoys an
adventure.  They enjoy being in your company because
of the excitement you
radiate.

41 TO 50 POINTS:
Others see you as fresh, lively, charming, amusing,
practical, and
always interesting; someone who's constantly in the
center of attention,
but sufficiently well-balanced not to let it go to
their head. They also
see you as kind, considerate, and understanding;
someone who'll always
cheer  them up and help them out.

31 TO 40 POINTS:
Others see you as sensible, cautious, careful &
practical. They see you
as clever, gifted, or talented, but modest... Not a
person who makes
friends too quickly or easily, but someone who's
extremely loyal to
friends you do make and who expect the same loyalty in
return. Those who
really get to  know you realize it takes a lot to
shake your trust in your
friends, but equally that it takes you a long time to
get over it if
that trust is ever broken.

21 TO 30 POINTS:
Your friends see you as painstaking and fussy. They
see you as very
cautious, extremely careful, a slow and steady
plodder. It'd really
surprise them if you ever did something impulsively or
on the spur of the
moment,  expecting you to examine everything carefully
from every angle
and then, usually decide against it. They think this
reaction is caused
partly by your careful nature.

UNDER 21 POINTS:
People think you are shy, nervous, and indecisive,
someone who needs
looking after, who always wants someone else to make
the decisions & who
doesn't want to get involved with anyone or anything.
They see you as a
worrier who always sees problems that don't exist.
Some people think
you're boring. Only those who know you well know that
you aren't.

Now forward this on to everyone you know, making sure
to put YOUR score
in the subject box.

Kathy,

Attached are two files:  a mini-book of EC3952.O run for Nov-08 thru Oct-23 
and a copy of the deal in the transport model.  The file is too large to 
email.  There are two tabs:  the first contains deal terms and the second is 
a copy of the P&L sheet as of 12/4/2000.  Call me with any questions you may 
have.  Thanks for your patience.

First of all, congrats on the big win this weekend.  They keep proving me 
wrong.  Second, sorry this is late.  Friday was 1st day, our longest of the 
month.

   DRAFT

This is a summary of where we stand from a Risk Management perspective on the 
PGT/Socal permanent assignment to Calpine  Currently there are 5 deals in 
Tagg and 1 in the transport  model.

 EC3952.O - Annuity where the West desk pays PGT (from $.08987 to $.17308) on 
67,500/Day thru Oct-23
 This deal will be unwound and this income (approx $30M) will fall out in the 
West desk

 EC3952.F - Buy from Canada of 30,000/Day thru Oct-08 at Malin for Index + 
$.00
 EC3952.K - Sell to AEC of 30,000/Day thru Oct-08 at Malin for Index + $.00
 As of now, these deals will remain unchanged in the system because AEC will 
not let us out of the firm contract

 EC2208.B - Buy from Canada of 22,500/Day thru Oct-08 at Malin for Index - 
$.005
 EC3952.B - Buy from Canada of 15,000/Day thru Oct-01 at Malin for Index - 
$.01
 These deals will be unwound, but discussions between Philip Allen and ??? 
will reveal details not known at this point in time   (Bid/Offer)

 Transport Model - Kingsgate to Malin capacity of 67,500/Day beginning Nov-08 
thru Oct-23
 This deal will have to be unwound or killed - Currently the deal is valued 
at approx $12M in the West Desk

After unwinding these deals, the West desk will be kept whole, the remainder 
will be granted out in orig.

This is my first go at it.  Let me know of any revisions you want.

DG    3-9573

You're welcome.  I had a good time also.  We should play again sometime when 
it's not so damn cold.  Looks like you were right about OU.  I really thought 
they would lose to KState.

Shelly,

I am looking for an Analyst to fill a position in Gas Risk Management.  I am 
the West Desk Controller and report to Jeff Gossett.  I think a Book 
Administrator role is a good position for an Analyst.  We have had success in 
with Analysts in our group.  I think it presents a good opportunity for them 
as well.  Please let me know how I can get on a list to talk with potential 
candidates.  I am ignorant of the process, so if I am presuming something 
incorrect, I would appreciate info on how this is supposed to work.  Thanks 
for your help.

My niece sent this today...got a good laugh from it!

A lady stopped unexpectedly by her recently married son's house.  She rang
the doorbell and stepped into the house to see her daughter-in-law standing
naked by the door.
"What are you doing?" she asked.
"I am waiting for my husband to come home from work," the daughter-in-law
replied.
"Why are you naked?" asked the mother-in-law.
"This is my love dress," the daughter-in-law replied.
"LOVE DRESS! You're naked," said the mother-in-law.
"But my husband loves it when I wear this dress. It makes him happy and he
makes me happy," said the  daughter-in-law "He will be home any minute now,
so perhaps you could stop by a little later?"
Soured by all of this romantic stuff, the mother-in-law left.
On the way home, she thought about the "LOVE DRESS" and got an idea. She
undressed, showered, applied her best perfume, and waited by the door for
her husband to come home.
Finally, his pickup truck drove up the drive way. Her husband opened the
door, and immediately saw his naked wife.
"What are you doing?" he asked.
"This is my love dress." She said, excitedly.
"Needs ironing." He replied.

we tee off.  We still need one more person.  Everyone else already had 
plans.  If you know of anyone who would like to play, invite them and let me

Please kill the duplicate sitara number as soon as possible.  I believe

Due to the sitara bridge failing earlier today, it looks as though 7 sitara 
deals got double booked..  Listed in the e-mail below you will find the EOL # 
and the correponding Sitara #'s.  Please review and kill the sitara deal that 
is not "linked" to the EOL #.

sounds good, do you have a spot on your team for me?
Jeff

I know this is very late notice, but up until yesterday I didn't think I was 
going to be free on Saturday.  My brother-in-law is hosting a tournament on 
Saturday at Cypress Lakes, which is just off of Hwy 290 at Cypress Rosehill.  
In other words, BFE.  $70 will get you a round of golf, lunch, and beer.  He 
will have a keg.  There will be prizes for the winners.  It is a four man 
best ball scramble.  Tee time is early:  7:30am.  I sent this to guys I

Gary and I are going to have a "get together" before the Holiday Party on 
Saturday, December 9th.  Please let me know if you want to stop by our place 
before we head out to Enron Field.  We live really only a few miles away from 
downtown, so this could be a good pit stop for all of you that live out in 
the "burbs"!   (No names mentioned).  

Anyway, let me know if you are able to come by and I will give you directions 
to our place.  Hope all of you can make it!

Thanks,

I know this is very late notice, but up until yesterday I didn't think I was 
going to be free on Saturday.  My brother-in-law is hosting a tournament on 
Saturday at Cypress Lakes, which is just off of Hwy 290 at Cypress Rosehill.  
In other words, BFE.  $70 will get you a round of golf, lunch, and beer.  He 
will have a keg.  There will be prizes for the winners.  It is a four man 
best ball scramble.  Tee time is early:  7:30am.  I sent this to guys I 
either know play or think play.  If you have someone else in mind, feel free 
to forward the message.  I don't have a team at all and wanted to see if

Hi Darron,

There's a deal in the FT-West book that needs to be moved to the 
FT-US/CAND-ERMS book right away.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.

Thanks

Hi Darron,

Please move these deals to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book by the end of tomorrow.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.  Also, please make sure 
that there aren't any deals between ECC and a third counterparty in any of 
your books.  If there are, could you please flip them to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS 
book.

Thanks
Stacey

Russ,

I got this from Regina just before she changed groups.

DG    3-9573

Uncle Clark,

It just dawned on my that I never really thanked you for our visit.  All four 
of us had a great time.  It was so good to see all of you and especially 
great to see the kids get together and have so much fun.  I really regret 
that as I was growing up, we really did not see that much of each other( and 
by we, I mean the Kansas group and the Girons).  But even given that, I feel 
as if you all have been part of my life and every time we get together it's 
like we have always spent alot of time together.  I guess that's why they 
call it family.  So once again, thanks for your hospitality and we look 
forward to our next get together, wherever and whenever it may be.

Darron

Done.  I did the 1999 changes as well.

DG    3-9573

   
	
	

Darron,
Could you please change rate on the above Sitara to $4.878216 for Oct. 00 
production?

Thanks for your help,
T  3-9852

I asked Keith Holst (trader) again.  His answer was the same.  There were 
more buyers than sellers in the West during March, hence the price was 
stronger.  Thanks.

DG

Darron --

Thanks for your response.  We understand that the west traded higher in 
general during March v. Feb,  as evidenced by the data.  However, we are 
looking for specific reasons as to why this is so.  For example, if the 
market was more volatile at these locations, then why?  What particular 
market conditions sparked large price changes, etc?  Please let me know if 
you have any questions.

Thanks,
Jennifer

   
	
	

Jennifer,
The market just traded higher in the West in general during the month of 
March compared to February.  That is why we see the shift in NGI-MALIN and

Rocky Mountain points were similar.  Please call if you have any further

Darron --

Before I send out the memo for March, I have a few questions about 3 curves 
that were reviewed this month.  Attached are Powerpoint slides containg the 
10 curves that were validated for March.  The ones I'm asking you to take a 
look at are:

NGI-MALIN
NGI-PGE CG
IF-CIG WIC

The shifts in MALIN and PGE CG are pretty clear.  For CIG WIC, please note 
how the front years show a price drop compared to prior months, while marks 
in the mid-years have shifted upward by approximately  $0.10.  Thanks for 
your help, and please let me know if you have any questions.

P&L is OK.  Open position is 39.0 contracts.

DG

Chris Abel
11/17/2000 05:17 PM

In addition:  expert clauses - which ones need to be changed, when and why - 
what are reversals and why we use them - how to check physical prompt month 
value for potential errors - how to calculate physical prompt month value - 
checking the OA Flash tab.  I am sure there are some others.

DG

Topics should include:  NX3 roll-off, the curveshift associate with basis NX3 
roll-off and where it will show up on the p&l, what days we will roll in 
index - the percentages, how to adjust percentages for fixed priced prompt 
month positions, when to bring in prompt month value, how to put liquidations 
in the physical P&L, how to roll the physical and financial p&l's, etc.

Any suggestions?

Dave

   
	
	

Our next class will combine EOM bench/NGP&L and P&L procedures.  We will hold 
the class Tuesday @ 9:30 and combine both groups 1&2 for one class.  Jeff 
would like to go over the bench and NGP&L process for 45 minutes or so, and 
the rest of the class will be handled by Dave and Kam.  I will leave it to 
you 2 to decide who will talk about what.  Lets get together on Monday to 
brainstorm.

A W4 calculates how much federal tax is withheld from your paycheck each pay 
period.  There are two basic drivers:  number of dependents and filing 
status.  The higher the number of dependents, the less is withheld.  Married 
and jointly will also have less withheld than married and seperately.  There 
is really no right or wrong answer, only opinion.  If you want more withheld 
each pay period so that there is less of a chance of actually owing $ on 
April 15th, then claim fewer dependents and married and seperately.  If you 
don't want the government to get your $ interest free, but are aware that you 
may owe $ later on (April 15th), then claim a higher number of dependents and 
married and jointly.  I hope that made sense.

Hey Scott T -  I was just up on 19 funny knowing you're right above me.
   They just sent me down a new W4 to fill out - do you know if its better
to
   file married and jointly or married and separately? How do I find out.
You
   know Mr. Scharck doesnt have a clue and Im not really sure either.
   Thanks for the idea about the DVD player - thats what he is getting and
Mike
   told me to get The Patriot, Matrix and Fight Club - Big George is
driving up
   with Drew, Chris Melber, Ross etc on Friday and he is going to take it
for me
   - so you don't have to mess with it.

   Ciao, Lester

Thank you,

Eric,
I am afraid I have not made that much progress on my assignment.  I talked to 
ML Ruffer about the $1.2M basis swap.  She does not specifically know about 
the deal, but does know she gave between $1M and $2M to the West desk out of 
a reserve behind the scenes.  I don't know for sure, but this has to be how 
the $ got in the West P&L.  It is booked on 11/12/99 which is between 
EC3952.P (the annuity getting the unamortized $27M into the West desk) and 
EC3952.S (the annuity getting the $5M from Corp into the West desk).  I 
hadn't paid attention until just now, but Suzette Emmons booked the deal.  
She ran the transport book at that time.  

The physical buys from Canada (EC2208.11, EC3952.15, and EC3952.11) are 
booked correctly in Sitara.  EC3952.11 was changed by Kathy Reeves from 
ending in '08 to ending in '01 on 4/4/00.  However, the end date remains '08 
in Sitara.  I don't know why the term was changed.

I have meetings almost all day.  I will still try and investigate, but I know 
you were looking for some answers today.  You may want to try and get in 
touch with Suzette and see if she remembers the basis swaps.

I was going to last night, but it didn't sound like you wanted to talk.  We 
had a great time.  Only wish we could have stayed longer.  It was cold but 
the game was fun.  It was good to see the kids getting along as well as they 
did.  We will try and make it a regular trip.  We also spoke about maybe 
getting together in Dallas sometime next year.  I need to go, but will talk 
to you later.

THE CLASSIC VERSION -
    The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his
house and laying up supplies for the winter. The Grasshopper thinks he's a
fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the ant
is warm and well fed. The grasshopper has no food or shelter so he dies out
in the cold.

THE MODERN VERSION -
 The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his
house and laying up supplies for the winter. The Grasshopper thinks he's a
fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away.
    Come winter, the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and
demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while
others are cold and starving. CBS, NBC and ABC show up to provide pictures
of the shivering grasshopper next to a video of the ant in his comfortable
home with a table filled with food.
    "America" is stunned by the sharp contrast. How can this be, that in a
country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so?
Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah with the grasshopper, and everybody cries
when they sing "It's Not Easy Being Green."
    Bill and Hillary Clinton make a special guest appearance on the CBS
Evening News to tell a concerned Dan Rather that they will do everything
they Can for the grasshopper who has been denied the prosperity he deserves
by Those who benefited unfairly during the Reagan summers, or as Bill
refers
to it as "Temperatures of the 80's."
    Jesse Jackson stages a demonstration in front of the ant's house where
the news stations film the group singing "We shall overcome". Jesse then
has
the group kneel down to pray to God for the grasshopper's sake.
    Al Gore exclaims in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has
gotten rich off the back of the grasshopper, and calls for an immediate tax
hike on the ant to make him pay his "fair share".
    Finally, the EEOC drafts the "Economic Equity and Anti-Ant Act",
retroactive to the beginning of the summer. The ant is fined for failing to
hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having nothing left to pay
his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by the government.
    Hillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a
Defamation suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a panel of
federal judges that Bill appointed from a list of single-parent welfare
recipients who can only hear cases on Thursday's between 1:30 and 3:00 PM
when there are no talk shows scheduled. The ant loses the case.
    The story ends as we see the grasshopper finishing up the last bits of
The ant's food while the government house he is in, which just happens to
be
the ant's old house, crumbles around him since he doesn't maintain it. The
ant has disappeared in the snow. And on the TV, which the grasshopper
bought
by selling most of the ant's food, they are showing Bill Clinton standing
before a wildly applauding group of Democrats announcing that a new era of
"fairness" has dawned in America.
    The grasshopper is found dead in a drug related incident and the house,
now abandoned, is taken over by a gang of spiders who terrorize the once
peaceful neighborhood.

Remember to Vote .!!

Here is another one.  It will be another Chicago book.  We will never 
officialize the book.  Thanks.

OK, so the classes start this week.  The first one will be on what to look 
for in a P&L and MiniBench to prove reasonableness.  Will Kelly and I will 
present the class.  We have a few items we want to go over, but I think the 
most beneficial part will be individual questions.  So bring them if you have 
them.  We are have split the entire Risk team into two groups.  Our breakout 
is as follows:

 Group1   Group2
 Carole    Jennifer
 Jason    Anne
 Chris   

Group 1 will meet this Wednesday @ 11:30am and Group 2 this Thursday @ 
11:30am.  We will have Chick-Fil-A for lunch.  Thanks.

IN THE NEWS..."Kids Find Contested Ballot to be Child's Play,"
The Shreveport Times, by Don Walker

"It's a ballot that perplexed Florida voters but was no match for the wits
of first- and fourth-graders at Stockwell Elementary School in Bossier City.

"Disillusioned and upset by the lingering chaos of this week's presidential
election, fourth-grade teacher Lisa Burns pulled a sample of the
controversial Palm Beach County, Fla., ballot off the Internet on Thursday.
She then put her class of 9- and 10-year-olds to the test.  'I gave them a
ballot and had them take a blue marker to vote for Al Gore and a red marker
to vote for George Bush. Then I had them put their name on the bottom of the
ballot and turn it in.'

"Turns out this election was mere child's play. Not one of the 22 students
present in class Thursday was confused by the ballot. Each one was marked
without error.

"Well, if a fourth-grader could do it, how about a first-grader? Down the
hall in Stacey Robinson's class, the ballot was handed out to 6- and
7-year-olds. Robinson used an overhead projector to point out Gore's name,
then asked the class of 24 students to find his bubble on the punch-card
ballot.

"'It wasn't a vote,' Robinson said. 'I just wanted to experiment to see if
they could find the correct bubble.'

"When the ballots were turned in, 19 of the first-graders marked the correct
bubble for Gore, three picked Buchanan's bubble, one picked Bush's and one
marked the bottom bubble for the 'Natural Law' party.

"'If a first-grader can choose the correct bubble, there's no legitimate
claim. Anyone could have done it,' Robinson said. 'A grown adult who took
any time at all could find it.'

"Still, even in a first-grade classroom, vote tabulations were the subject
of protest and controversy. 'I thought we were voting,' Brady McCoy, 6, of
Haughton grumbled after he was told to find and punch the 'Gore' bubble. 'I
wanted to vote for George Bush!'"

Hi Dawn,
The rate at some locations has not been changed in Sitara.  Are they supposed

Well, I win the award for ass of the week and probably the year.  I really 
can't begin to apologize enough for Tuesday.  I won't offer an excuse.  Guys 
on the Central desk asked me a question as soon as I hung up with you, and 
before I knew it, it was around 2:30pm.  But the worst part is, I didn't 
realize what I had done until later the next day.  It was disrespectful and I 
sincerely apologize.  I do have a conflict tomorrow.  And I will understand 
if you want to stop the sessions.  Thanks.

Hello, Young People.....
?
Still planning on the KU/UT game next weekend, I  hope.? If you are flying 
in, you can get?from the airport, about 30-35  miles, without hitting a 
traffic light until the last mile or so.
?
FROM THE AIRPORT:
1.? Exit the airport toward Kansas City on  I-29 South.? When you get to
2.??I-635, go South; probably will be  marked to "Wichita" or maybe Kansas 
City.? When you get to
3.??I-35, go South again.? You will  be somewhere around 50th street.? Street 
numbers increase as you go  south.
4.? After 75th Street stay in the right lane  and take Hiway 69 South.
5.? Stay on Hiway 69; after 119th Street it  will curve left and then right.? 
After the right hand curve, the road  merges with another highway.? Stay in 
the extreme right lane  and
6.? Exit at 135th street.? Exit to the  right and stay in the right lane 
until the first light; (Antioch).? (About  half mile).
7.? Turn right at Antioch (first light) and  get into the left lane.
8.? Short block to the first light; this is  133rd Street; turn left.
9.? Go to the second right; this is  Kessler.? Turn right on Kessler.
10.? Take the immediate left onto 132nd  Place.? Go to second house on right; 
not counting the house on the  corner.? The address is 9210.
?
After you leave the airport, the exits onto I-29  and then onto I-35 come a 
little quickly, so watch for the signs.?  I expect to be home all weekend.? 
But, if I  am out, the garage door keypad combination is "0730".? Make 
yourselves at  home and help yourselves to anything that is not tied or 
nailed down or  hazardous.? My phone number is (913) 402-9210; cell phone is 
(913)  269-6247.? Not necessary to dial the area code once you get into  
Kansas.? From the airport (Missouri) you'll need the area  code.
?
If you're driving, exit I-35 in Olathe at Exit  215.? Turn right and go about 
4.5 miles to Switzer (school on left; park on  right).? Left on Switzer to 
first right (133rd Street).? Right on  133rd to second left (Kessler).? Left 
on Kessler; left on 132nd Place to  house.? Let me know when you expect to 
arrive and then depart and maybe we  can line something up to keep you busy 
while you're here.? Sean and Tracie  will be in San Antonio that weekend, and 
Mike and Christine can't make it, but  Michelle and her gang and Kim are 
anxious to see you again.? See you  soon......Clark.

Darron,

For Oct 2000 I found a Liquidation amount in the Central region for The 
Peoples Gas Light & Coke......$336,234.06
Yet, I show no transactions for them in that region.  I looked in tagg - deal 
capture and for the tagg numbers listed
in the detail OA-liquidation spreadsheet (N17872.1   N17872.2   N18064.1   
N18064.2), I either saw no "comments",
or there was a comment referring to a "North Shore Baseload sale".

Would you please assist me or direct me to the person who would be familiar 
with this.
I am placing copies of the documents referred to above, on your desk.

Thanks for you help.

Doug

Me and the kids get in at 10am, Kristi has to stay a little later for work 
and will be in at 3pm.  I was also thinking we could buy tickets at the 
stadium.  Don't worry about not taking time off.  See you Thursday.

DG

Kim.Mayers@mail.sprint.com on 11/07/2000 10:24:50 AM
I can't believe it either.  I just accepted a new job, so unfortunately
I don't think I can take any time off.  I am going to try and leave
early Friday.  I'm still testing out the waters over here in my new
group.  I am free in the evenings so I will plan on coming over to
dad's.  I would invite you all to stay at my house, but I don't have any
beds in the bedrooms!  I just moved in and am in the process of
furnishing.  What time are you coming in on Thursday?  Dad and I can
come up with some fun things for you all to do during the day.

We haven't purchased tickets for the game on Saturday.  We were thinking
we could just buy them the day of the game.  Shouldn't be a sell out!
I'm sure KU will lose.  Michelle's family is all excited about going to
the game Saturday.

I'm looking forward to seeing you all.  It's going to be a little cold
so be sure to bring warm clothes!

The kids and I are arriving at 9:45am on Thursday.  Because of work 
commitments, Kristi is arriving at 12:30pm.  The 3 of us will get a rental 
car and make our way to your place.  Are you going to be home then?  Then we 
will go pick up Kristi later.  We have no plans at the moment (other than 
going to the game on Saturday).  We are leaving on Sunday at an awful time, 
though, 6:30am.  They didn't give me many options using reward travel.  We 
are all looking forward to the trip.  See you on Thursday.

DG

Kristi said you called on Saturday.  I was golfing.  What did you think about 
the draft?  I thought LD was a good college player, but not great.  Everyone 
seems to think he will be an All-Pro type player before he's done.  As long 
as he works hard, I think SR would make the best Pro.  But what do I know?

We are flying in on Thursday.  We plan on renting a car and driving to your 
place.  I'll update you on specific times early next week.  Because me and

Just when you thought you knew everything (no, it's not an anti cola add  
;-)...  

1.In many states the highway patrol carries two gallons of Coke in the truck  
to remove blood from the highway after a car accident. 
2.You can put a  T-bone steak in a bowl of coke and it will be gone in two 
days. 
3.To clean a  toilet: Pour a can of Coca-Cola into the toilet bowl....... Let 
the "real thing"  sit for one hour, then flush clean. 
4.The citric acid in Coke removes stains  from vitreous china. 
5.To remove rust spots from chrome car bumpers: Rub the  bumper with a 
crumpled-up piece of Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil dipped in  Coca-Cola. 
6.To clean corrosion from car battery terminals: Pour a can of  Coca-Cola 
over the terminals to bubble away the corrosion. 
7.To loosen a  rusted bolt: Applying a cloth soaked in Coca-Cola to the 
rusted bolt for several  minutes. 
8.To bake a moist ham: Empty a can of Coca-Cola into the baking  pan;rap the 
ham in aluminum foil, and bake. Thirty minutes before the ham is  finished, 
remove the foil, allowing the drippings to mix with the Coke for a  sumptuous 
brown gravy. 
9.To remove grease from clothes: Empty a can of coke  into a load of greasy 
clothes, add detergent, And run through a regular cycle.  The Coca-Cola will 
help loosen grease stains. It will also clean road haze  fromyour 
windshield.  

FYI: 1.The active ingredient in Coke is phosphoric acid. It's pH is 2.8. It  
will dissolve a nail in about 4 days. 
2.To carry Coca Cola syrup (the  concentrate) the commercial truck must use 
the Hazardous material place cards  reserved for Highly Corrosive materials. 
3.The distributors of coke have  been using it to clean the engines of their 
trucks for about 20 years! Drink up!  No joke. Think what coke and other soft 
drinks do to your teeth on a daily  basis. A tooth will dissolve in a cup of 
coke in 24-48 hours.

Jeremy,

I don't have access to run this book.  Will you please get me authorization?  
Thanks.

DG

Let's make sure we are doing this every night.  I think Jason has been 
running the official post id macro most nights, but we need to have the last 
person finished do it every day.  I sure can crank out the emails when I get 
some uninterrupted time to myself!

DG

Sally -

These are the steps that we have taken to insure that the positions the V@R 
engine picks up are correct:

1. Each book adm. now checks his/her own positions that are going into V@R,  
rather than just one check at  a consolidated level.
2. All regional controllers will receive a sheet at the end of the night, 
verifying that all books are officialized.

I am in Chicago today and tomorrow.  I will look at this more while I am here.

DG

I can't remember if I forwarded this to you already.  Thanks.

Just a quick request for you to go into all your books to make sure that 
there are no ECC deals booked there.  If there are any that are with 
counterparties other than RISKMANTRA, they need to be flipped to the 
FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as soon as possible.  Invoicing for November should 
start today, and both ECC and ENA are held back from invoicing until these 
deals are fixed, as the deals will be invoiced by the wrong Enron 
counterparty if they aren't.  If you could please let me know when the deals 
have been fixed, I can let the accounting department in Houston know when 
they can start invoicing as well.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about this matter.

Thank you
Stacey

Will you two please get this info to Dutch.  Thanks.

DG

Attached is the original churn that was submitted, the night that this was

Just when you thought you knew everything (no, it's not an anti cola add  
;-)...  

1.In many states the highway patrol carries two gallons of Coke in the truck  
to remove blood from the highway after a car accident. 
2.You can put a  T-bone steak in a bowl of coke and it will be gone in two 
days. 
3.To clean a  toilet: Pour a can of Coca-Cola into the toilet bowl....... Let 
the "real thing"  sit for one hour, then flush clean. 
4.The citric acid in Coke removes stains  from vitreous china. 
5.To remove rust spots from chrome car bumpers: Rub the  bumper with a 
crumpled-up piece of Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil dipped in  Coca-Cola. 
6.To clean corrosion from car battery terminals: Pour a can of  Coca-Cola 
over the terminals to bubble away the corrosion. 
7.To loosen a  rusted bolt: Applying a cloth soaked in Coca-Cola to the 
rusted bolt for several  minutes. 
8.To bake a moist ham: Empty a can of Coca-Cola into the baking  pan;rap the 
ham in aluminum foil, and bake. Thirty minutes before the ham is  finished, 
remove the foil, allowing the drippings to mix with the Coke for a  sumptuous 
brown gravy. 
9.To remove grease from clothes: Empty a can of coke  into a load of greasy 
clothes, add detergent, And run through a regular cycle.  The Coca-Cola will 
help loosen grease stains. It will also clean road haze  fromyour 
windshield.  

FYI: 1.The active ingredient in Coke is phosphoric acid. It's pH is 2.8. It  
will dissolve a nail in about 4 days. 
2.To carry Coca Cola syrup (the  concentrate) the commercial truck must use 
the Hazardous material place cards  reserved for Highly Corrosive materials. 
3.The distributors of coke have  been using it to clean the engines of their 
trucks for about 20 years! Drink up!  No joke. Think what coke and other soft 
drinks do to your teeth on a daily  basis. A tooth will dissolve in a cup of 
coke in 24-48 hours.  

Please add Carole Frank to the list.  Her NT username is cfrank2.

Kathy,

I don't think I will be able to make our meeting tomorrow.  Can we pick it up 
again next week?  Thanks.

DG

I think it will be a very close game.  Except for the fart against Colorado,  
you just don't bet against the Aggies at Kyle Field.  OU is obviously a very 
good team.  But I think more importantly, they are just playing great 
football.  They make plays when they need them, and I know it sounds like 
sour grapes, but frankly, they are also getting lucky.  When the QB heaves a 
pass 40 yds downfield off his back foot and it goes for a TD week after week, 
the football Gods are smiling on you big time.  But regardless, you've got to 
admire Stoops and the job he has done.  They have proven for three 
consecutive games that they can score almost at will against some of the best 
defenses in the country.  

And as far as the Horns are concerned, I still think they are just an above 
average team.  They have beaten no one of any (and I mean any) significance.  
They were completely outclassed against the one (albeit right now, the best 
team in the country) good team they have played.  And lost to a bad Stanford 
team.  But the optimist in me says they are winning at home and that may 
result in a T+1 win.  But right now, I think the Aggies have a better team.  
But if they start thinking about aTM, they will lose to both Tech and KU.  
They are not good enough to play poorly and win against decent competition.

DG

greg_carrow@valic.com on 10/30/2000 10:46:29 AM
Don't think  I'm crazy, but I think the Aggies will beat OU (man I would
hate that, we would never hear the end of it).  Crazy things happen in
College Station,  I wish I were out of the country on that day.   Right
now, the Aggies look like they could beat us.  We better get our shit
together.  What are your thoughts?  Again, I hope I'm wrong but the Aggies
worry me.

Later

Here's what happened.

I spoke with Bill K. about the TDS positions problems we had this morning.  
They had to take TDS down this weekend and when it was brought back up all 
the positions were reloaded.  

He thinks the new TDS portcalc will be ready to go later this week which will 
prevent this from happening again.

Hi Jeff,

I'm hoping you're the person who takes care of this book.  If not, could
you please forward this message to the appropriate person.  There are
a few deals in the MGMT-WEST book that need to be moved to the
FT-US/CAND-ERMS BOOK.  These are all EnronOnline deals so they
were put into this book automatically.

Q24809.1
Q47957.1
Q50596.1

Could you please tell everyone down there that books deals into Houston
books, to make sure that there aren't any ECC deals with counterparties
in these books.  Nymex closes today, and I'm going to have to start invoicing
on Monday, so I need to have all deals with ECC in the FT-US/CAND-ERMS
book by the end of today.  

Please let me know if you have any questions on this matter.

????????A shepherd was herding his flocks in a remote pasture when 
suddenly a brand new Jeep Cherokee advanced out of a dust cloud towards him. 
The 
driver, a young man in a Brioni suit, Gucci shoes, Ray Ban sunglasses and a 
YSL 
tie leaned out of the window and asked our shepherd: "If I can tell you 
exactly how many sheep you have in your flock, will you give me one?" 

The shepherd looks at the yuppie, then at his peacefully grazing flock and 
calmly answers "sure!" 
The yuppie parks the car, whips out his notebook, 
connects it to a cell-phone, surfs to a NASA page on the Internet where he 
calls 
up a GPS satellite navigation system, scans the area, opens up a database and 
some 60 Excel spreadsheets with complex formulas. Finally he prints out a 150 
page report on his hi-tech miniaturized printer, turns round to our shepherd 
and 
says: "You have here exactly 1,586 sheep!" 

"This is correct. As agreed, you can take one of the sheep" says the 
shepherd. He watches the young man make a selection and bundle it in his 
Cherokee. 

Then he says: "If I can tell you exactly what your business is, 
will you give me my sheep back?" 

"Okay, why not" answers the young man. "You are a consultant" says the 
shepherd. 

"This is correct" says the yuppie, "How did you guess that?" 

"Easy" answers the shepherd. "You turn up here although nobody called 
you. You want to be paid for the answer to a question I already knew the 
solution to. And you don't know shit about my business--? you took my dog."

During the August settlement period, we discovered at least 4 book codes that 
had just recently started containing financial, third-party deals in them.  
We tried to put a procedure into place where we were calling the risk guys to 
find out about new books.  I don't know, however, if we are calling the right 
people because we were not told about the 4 books that we discovered on our 
own.  

From now on, I am going to have Beatrice Reyna from my group call someone 
from Reporting (Frank) and key people in Risk before we run our NYMEX 
invoices at the end of the month.  Will, can you please send me a list of 
people that Bea should contact that would know what we are talking about?  
Even if the book codes are not brand new, but if they have just started 
putting financial deals in them, WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THEM.  

Thanks you so much for your help,

I think Sitara deal 286147 is not pulling the correct price in Unify.  The 
reference price is NWPL.RKYMTNS.GDP.DA and the particular month in question

My apologies to you left-wingers who may receive this e-mail...

While Al Gore  has a habit of exaggerating his record, these numbers tell
us the real truth  about his record on education, healthcare and taxes:

AL GORE'S  EDUCATION PLANS...

$10,000...? tax deduction that Al Gore says will  be received by "all
students who want to go to college".

$800... tax  deduction is the reality.

0... students working their way through college  getting a tax credit
because they do not pay enough in income  taxes.

30,000,000... low-income households get no benefit on Gore's  education
plan.

0...? families making over $20,000 get a  benefit.

5,000,000... upper income families are ineligible.

0...  deductions or credits for room, board, books, supplies, and travel.

1...  education plan that is almost identical to the one that failed in the
Clinton  White House.

AL GORE'S PROGRAM ON HEALTHCARE:

$600... access  fee per year to obtain prescription drug coverage under the
Gore  plan.

Thought you would appreciate the "discussions" going on between Bass and 
Landry.

ENJOY!!!

I guess you just summed up the difference between our two programs - at Texas 
we play for National Championships  at LSU you play to make the Sharpie 
Independence bowl.  Yes we were rated in the top 10 at the beginning of the 
year and yes we are rated #20 now.  You forget that we are only half way 
through the season - we will be in the top 10 again before the year is out.  
Where will LSU be?  Besides we weren't supossed to play in the Orange Bowl 
this year ( this is only Mack Brown's 3rd year), but anything less than the 
Rose Bowl nest year will be dissapointing.

See you in Pasadena 2002

Its all about expectations, my man!  What was Texas Ranked at the beginning 
of the season????  I am waiting for CNNSI to come out with a poll on the most 
overrated team of the year---my guess---a pick'em b/w Alabama and Texas.  Any 
time Texas is challenged they "you-know-what" their pants.  

CKL  

   

Easy there Superfan!  Remember, you still have to win 1 of your last 3 games, 
none of those are gimmes (see UAB).  As far as bowls go,  LSU to the Cotton 
Bowl? Come on, the Sharpie Independence Bowl is more likely (although UT will 
probably join you).  In addition, a sweep would never happen if you were 
lucky enough to face UT - can you say better QB, RBs, WRs, and Defense.  
Besides, we have turned the corner after our embarrassing loss to OU (the #2 
team in the country). I feel pretty good about our chances the rest of the 
way. 

 Face it, the SEC is having a down year.  It happens to all Conferences.  
It's just that this down year has enabled LSU a few chances to tear down the 
goalposts (and against the #11 team in the country - how sad is that).  

 And far be it from me to defend the Aggies, but which school was the one to 
back out of that contract a few years back?

See you in the Shreveport.

Final Score 
UT - 58
LSU - 3

There are some pretty interesting college football predictions flying around! 
After their incredible victory last Saturday night, some folks have LSU going 
to the Cotton Bowl this year.  I would love to see LSU sweep UT this year in 
yet one more major college sport-------basketball (NCAA tournament), baseball 
(College World Series), and, yes, football in the Cotton Bowl this year.  
However, it would be just as sweet to wip up on our old football 
nemesis---The Aggies.  Although I think the Tigers would have to be a little 
more careful, since the Aggies occasionally spice up their offense with a 
crazy "REEEEEEEE-Verse" play or maybe even a pass on first down.

We can only hope that one of these situations occur!

GEAUX TIGERS!

We have some new procedures for changing deals that affect other books.  
Please read and let me know if you have any further questions.  You don't 
need to request minibook access individually.  I have, so if needed we can 
run them on my machine.  Thanks.
DG    3-9573

Effective immediately,  if anyone changes any deal for any reason,  they need 
to provide a minibook with a before and after of exactly what they did.  This 
used to be a common courtesy,  but it looks like we need a stated policy in 
place.  You guys will therefore have to get minibook access to calc all books 
on a mini-book level from Jeremy.  Please let me know the timing Jeremy gives 
for getting the appropriate people mini-book access as soon as possible.  It 
is critical that we get this done right away.  I know that this is not a 
one-sided issue.  No group is better or more important than any other group.  
It is therefore important that we do a better job of communicating across 
groups.

As you know I am moving to Global Products Risk Management soon.  As part of 
my delegation of duties I will be passing the TDS security on to the Enron 
Security group and your groups.

Currently I get all SRRS requests to approve     - This is what I need 
someone from your group to do.
Then I setup the user in TDS with the correct Book access  - This is what 
security will do.

I would like a primary & secondary individual to be set up for approving SRRS 
request from each desk.  If you do not provide me with 2 names - you will be 
listed as the primary.
 
My initial meeting with Security is tomorrow morning.

Jeff,
I think Risk can do two things to improve the process:  have more of us 
involved in the process so they actually see the implications of booking 
deals incorrectly and actively following up on recurring problems.  This last 
one I am particularly bad about.  I will see a variance that is rather small 
and just take it without looking into the underlying cause more carefully.  I 
think the OA group in general should take a more active approach in 
preventing problems rather than just identifying them.  But I know that is 
easier said than done.

This is a modification of the old file.  If you had the same book and

I would like each of your book admins using WeaponX to begin using the 
following procedures at least once/week (if they aren't already).

Open the database while holding down on the shift key.  This will open the 
database, but prevent the main form from opening automatically.  Next, the 
admin should go to Access menu selections and choose Tools/Database 
Utilities/Compact Database.  After the database has completed compacting, you 
can use the database as normal.

Just a quick explanation:

This is standard procedure for Access databases.  WeaponX imports and deletes 
a lot of data on a daily basis.  When data is deleted, the space is not freed 
up that was used by the data.  Therefore, as time goes by, the database size 
grows and grows and needs to be periodically compacted.

The Texas WeaponX file that I compacted reduced from 520 MB to 30 MB and one 
for the west went from 400 MB to 12 MB.  You can see that we will save 
several GB if everyone begins compacting the databases on a regular basis.

Please note:  Even though this is standard Access procedure, I would 
recommend that the book admin save a copy of their existing WeaponX file 
prior to compacting for the first time.  Once the file is compacted and a 
daily run has been successful, they can delete the backup file.  It is not 
necessary for them to save a backup copy each time before compacting.  I am 
only recommending it for the first compact.

I don't anticipate any problems with this procedure.  As a matter of fact, 
Crystal (East desk I believe) already compacts the database on a daily 
basis.  In addition Ann (West desk) ran a test for me with no problems.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Greg

Please make sure we stay off the "list".  Thanks.

DG

We have been tracking books that are not officialized on a daily basis.  This 
list goes to Sally Beck and is reviewed at the end of each week by Rick Buy.  
Rick has been vocal about taking corrective action if people forget to 
officialize.   It is imperative that we take extra care to ensure that all 
books are marked official each night before going home.  A control process 
should be implemented immediately to absolutely avoid being on the list.  

Please contact me if you have any questions (x-35242).

Thanks,
Mike

Sitara, Sitara numbers in Tagg, Tagg numbers in SCI, and especially EOL 
numbers in Tagg.  I just got a call about the park & loan on Friday.  You 
need to put EOL as the system of origin and the EOL number.  Thanks.

When you are manually entering the EMW deals into tagg, are you referencing

I was looking at the tagg deal you gave me last Friday (Q40121) and it does 
not reference it.  Should it?  Or, because it is funky, does it not have to?

Dawn

These places carry the Onkyo receiver.  I don't think they carry Polk, but 
ask them who you should call for Polk speakers.  The place I got mine from a

Mike,

The reason my mistake was not caught on the benchmark signoff procedure is 
that the postid in question did not have a net position.  The procedure 
Rahmann showed you is where we check GERMS positions to the position reports 
we run using Excel queries.  If a postid has a net position and is not 
officialized, it will be caught using this procedure.  It will not, however, 
if the postid does not have a position.  I understand the importance of 
officializing postid's, as does the entire West desk.  Thanks.

DG    3-9573

Jeff,

FYI - Darron Giron didn't officialize the West-NW-GDL book on Friday.  Please 
re-emphasize the importance of not forgetting.  Also, Rahmann showed me a 
control he has to catch books not officialized each night which looked like 
an effective tool.  I wonder why he didn't see this book on Friday.

I have decided to revive the risk brown bag training sessions.

I need, from each of you, a list of the topics you would like to see 
covered.  I would like to see topics ranging from the most basic, up - 
whatever you feel is necessary for your group.  Please provide these to me no 
later than 04/18.  Feel free to offer anything.  Think about the concepts in 
the training modules while you are compiling your lists.

Once I have the topics, I will work with you to arrange a logical order to 
cover them in.  After that  Irena and I will set up a calendar, with 
approximately one session per month.  I am targeting mid-May for the first 
session.

The format of each session is up to the presenter, but a couple of 
suggestions are: a short presentation followed by Q&A, or an open forum.  
Each session will be led by one of you, a suitable substitute, Jeff, or I, 
depending on the topic.  I will schedule, with your input and cooperation, 
who will present each topic.

I am also sending this note to John and Russ.  

John, I ask that you think about OA concepts that you feel will benefit the 
risk group, help our personnel work better with your group, and help us 
understand your duties better.  I would like for you to present at least a 
couple of topics to us.

Russ, if you think there are Sitara issues that would benefit the group, 
please let me know.

I am open to whether these sessions are mandatory or not.  My feeling is that 
some should be and others (the ones of a more basic nature) should only be 
mandatory for those people you feel need that month's subject matter.  Let me 
know your opinion on this.

With a small investment of your time, I believe this will be an excellent 
vehicle to get (and keep) topics of interest and training in front of your 
people.

I look forward to receiving your lists.  Let me know if you have any 
questions.

Greg

It's $11,137.05.  Can you input that on that deal #157584 and let me know 
when you're done.

Thanks,

Mike,

How goes it?  I was thinking about you guys this weekend.  We were in town 
for the game (if you want to call it a game).  We ended up staying at a 
friends place.  I think that is the first time in quite a while we haven't 
seen you on this particular weekend.  We are still plugging along.  How about 
you?  I thought I heard you were buying a new house.  Is that right?  Well, I 
just hadn't talked to you in a while and I saw you email address on a message 
from Sean.  We are going up to KU for the Texas game again.  I can't believe 
it has been 4 years since we were up there.  Take care.

DG

I'm with you.  I told my wife I thought it would be a 3 touchdown game, but a 
49 point margin is unacceptable.  I was at the game and it was as if the 
Texas coaches got a bunch of guys from the frat houses this week and put 
together a game plan on Saturday morning before kickoff.  They were out of 
position, slow, unmotivated, and flat out not prepared to play.  I like Brown 
and actually think he is a good fit, but at some point you actually have to 
coach.  I lay this all at his feet.  Obviously the coordinators bear some 
major responsibility as well.  I really don't know what to expect for the 
remainder of the season.  They obviously are not as bad as they showed on 
Saturday.  But the fact remains that they are capable of playing that poorly 
on any Saturday, and I really did not think that with this defense they could 
be humiliated.  I was very wrong.  Something has to change.  The fact is they 
are 3-5 in the last 8 games.  And were favored in all but one.  Lack of 
talent is no longer an excuse.  I think the entire remainder of the season 
hinges on this Saturday.  If they play as poorly as they have all season 
(they have beaten 3 terrible teams, and lost to a bad one) against Colorado, 
they will lose and I could see them finishing at 6-5 and even 5-6 not out of 
the question.  For this reason, I think that this could be the biggest game 
of Brown's tenure at UT.  What do you think?

It looks like we need to be consistent in booking the GD spread deals.  Take 
a look at the example and please remember to book all future deals in a 
similar manner.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

DG

	
	                           
	

Hi Dutch,

I was hoping you could spread the word to the book admins regarding a data 
entry methodology requirement for Gas Daily 4 legged deals. The Confirms 
group is working with Ricky Dang to expand the logic and capabilities of 
their systems to accomodate automated confirms on deals done in the new 
format, but in order for this to work, it is critical that all Gas Daily 4 
legged deals entered manually into TAGG be booked in the same leg order as 
those which bridge automatically. Although the legs can technically be 
entered in any order as far as Risk is concerned, such deviations will cause 
failures from the confirm end. If the Gas Daily book admins can follow the 
same entry order used in deal # Q25289.1, .2, .3, .4 , the Confirms Group 
should be able to work with it from there. Just let me know if this will 
create any problems from your end. Thanks!

Torrey

Regina,

As we discussed yesterday, I need access to West deals in Sitara.  At a 
mininum I still need access to all Chicago/Midwest deals also.  Thanks.

Effective today,  Darron Giron will assume the responsibility of West

the business and settlements.  Please join me in congratulating Darron on his 
new responsibilities.

Jeremy,

I want to move all deals currently in the INTRA-EMWMEH book into the 
FT-IM-ENOV book.  Attached is a forwards detail by risk of the deals in

Who is interested?  let us know asap so that we can find subs if needed!

Have you had a chance to look at this.  Dave at The New Power Group is 
wanting his money.

Thanks,

Darron,  

Here is the list sent from Dave.  Also he is questioning N99383.  Leg 2 and 3 
net out and he shows this deal should be there. 

Please let me know if you need additional information.

Thanks for your help!

I've attached a list of the 10 deals that I don't recognize.  I grouped them

negative) but they have different prices.

Let me know what you find out.

Don't worry about it.  If you can't go, you can't go.  You are not going to 
pay for the tickets if you don't use them.  Hope you feel better.

Darron,

Thank you for the directions and the tickets.  Unfortunately, I have not been 
feeling well and I may not end up going.  However, I should know more by 
tommarrow.  If someone else can use the tickets then by all mean let them use 
them.  If no one uses the tickets, then I will cover the cost of the tickets 
since you were saving them for me.  I still really want to go and maybe after 
another nights rest I might feel better, so I will give you a call in the 
morning.

Thanks again.

Adios,

Kevin,

Doing some more month end clean up.  

I received an invoice from Peoples Gas to ENA for $5,000.  The description is:

For Summer-Winter Exchange Agreement between Peoples and ENA from June 1,2000 
through July 31,200 for 1Bcf.

1 Bcf Program Original Hedge:  1,000,000 MMBtu x .005 = $5,000

I cannot find a Sitara deal for this amount.  Will you please look into 
this?  They told me the deal maker is Richard Tomaski.

If you send me your fax number I'll send you a copy of the invoice.

Thanks,
Kevin

Again this month, you are going to have to calculate your basis positions 
(officialize) twice.  Once for the TDS download, and once for the Benchmark 
for V@R.  For the TDS calc, all  (100% ) basis needs to show up for prompt 
month.  For the V@R calculations we will need to roll 50% of basis off 
tonight,  and 50% tommorrow.  I would recommend that you use two different 
post ID's to do this.  That way you can use your 100% calc for your curve 
shift report and it will reflect any change in prompt month index as curve 
shift and not a change deal.  We will need two calcs until indexes are set.  
Just to be clear,  calc your 100% basis calc first.  Officialize.  Load your 
positions into TDS. Unofficialize. Calc your 50% basis calc.  Officialize.  
Run all reports off of the 100% basis calc. 

Also,  we will roll-off 50% of all index positions (Gas Daily and Physical) 
tonight and roll-in 50% of physical and gas daily index.  And the other 50% 
tommorrow.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Jeff

OK, so I really screwed up.  I was getting the tickets out last night so I 
wouldn't forget them this morning and remembered that I am going to the 
airport, not the office.  So I'll call you when I get in later this 
afternoon.  I thought about FedEx, but don't want to take the chance that 
they get lost in the Enron building.  I hope you travel via 290 to Austin 
because I think the easiest solution is for me to leave them at my house and 
you could pick them up on you way out.  I also have a couple of EndZone 
passes with the tickets.  Sorry for the screw-up.  I'll talk to you this 
afternoon.

We have the NXAVC settle for Aug at $31.138.  So just pay the lesser of.

Thanks. I want to let you know that ENA's price is now $.1148 higher than 
what Agave invoiced for 08/00. I have paid at the invoiced price, since it is 
less. The difference in the price is in the value for Crude Merc. Your 
spreadsheet has $31.138 and they show $29.965.

Genaro,

The Sitara was not updated for Aug.  I just corrected Sitara.  So you can 
redraft in Unify.  I attached the completed calc-sheet.  Sorry for the delay.

Darron,

 Do you put together a spreadsheet calculating the price for gas purchases 
from Agave on NNG at the Hobbs Plant? If so, can you forward a copy to me? 
For 08/00 production, there is a $.56 difference from what is in Sitara and 
what the customer invoiced us.

Thanks,

best way to end this strategy against us is to become the aggressor on=20
offense and not sit back passively and react to what the defense is giving=
=20
us. =20
=09
=09In order for us to achieve this, I think it starts with us putting our b=
est=20
athletes on the field on offense. These guys may not be the most experience=
d=20
players, but they will gain experience with playing time, and they have the=
=20
ability to make a team pay for selling out with the blitz. It's time to sta=
rt=20
Roy Williams and B.J. Johnson at receiver (along with Montrell Flowers) and=

play a one-back offensive set. Our fullbacks are not a threat offensively a=

Hodges Mitchell is not an I-back who is adept at following the fullback=20
through the hole. Hodges' strength is operating in space and making people=

=09
=09I also think Chris Simms needs to get the bulk of the minutes at quarter=
back.=20
Major Applewhite has all the intangibles in the world but Simms could (and=
=20
probably does) possess all of the same skills. He just hasn't had the chanc=
e=20
to display them. We desperately need to have all playmakers on the field if=

we are going to turn this thing around. If not, I could see this season=20
slipping to 7-4 real quick. What are your thoughts, Chip?=20

=20
this Stanford loss emotionally. Something tells me if Texas can find some=

resolve and perform really well, you'll see some solid performances at all=
=20
the positions where problems currently exist. In 1996, Texas was No. 6 and=

Notre Dame was No. 9. Texas had the game won in Austin and then lost. UT th=

opponent, Houston.=20
=09
=09That was a different coach and different players. But the common thread =
was=20
that Texas hit the top 10 and then choked. If Texas is hung over from its=

loss to Stanford, trouble could be on the horizon. If Texas can find resolv=
e=20
to show everyone that Stanford truly was a game in which everything that=20

rd=20
team to beat the rest of the way. Tuesday night Mack Brown said the Longhor=

because he was practicing with the first team on Tuesday. That has been the=

trend. Whoever practices with the first team gets the start. Anyway, we'll=

see how they respond after the Stanford game. Major Applewhite was erratic =

his play, despite almost leading the Longhorns back from the dead to a=20

what Simms can do against Houston before picking one or the other =20

=09to get solo duty in the Oklahoma and Colorado games. =20
=09
=09Granted, if one struggles along the way, the other will come in. But Mac=

=09Q: Don't know whether you can address any or all of these questions in y=
our=20
column, but I've seen some unflattering trends in Mack Brown's program and=
=20
wanted your feedback. Mack Brown is a great recruiter, no argument there.=
=20
However, can he motivate? It seems like he can't get the team "up" sometime=
s=20
and can't adjust the team's mood during a game.=20
=09
=09About offensive coordinator Greg Davis, I don't know who is responsible =
for=20
the offensive line but since it is an offensive group, in more ways than on=
e,=20
I put it under him. With guys the size that UT has, shouldn't even Hodges=

Mitchell be able to run? Who tagged Leonard Davis as a pro? Why does Davis=
=20
love Mitchell? Sure, he gained 1,300-plus yards last year, but how many of=
=20
those yards were "move=20
=09
=09 the chains" type of runs that allowed UT to hold the ball on the ground=
 and=20
protect a lead? I thought it was going to be running back by committee but=
=20
all we have seen is the coaches continuing the same mistake - abandoning th=
e=20
run and using the wrong back for the wrong situations.=20
=09
=09Mitchell can run to the outside, but he cannot run through the defensive=
=20
tackles. And even if he does get holes, he still will never break through t=
he=20
linebackers for a TD. Why not put Ivan Williams or Kenny Hayter back there=
=20
with Mitchell and go with a two-back, three-wide offense? You don't lose a=

receiver as Hodges is a nice, smart receiver.
=09
=09Other ramblings: Is Quentin Jammer really a corner? He got beat MANY tim=

events. But in talking to Mack Brown on Tuesday, he said it's fair to beat=

learning what it takes to compete as a top-ranked team.=20
=09
=09To be fair to Brown, he did say repeatedly that his team was overrated a=
nd=20
needed time to grow into some key positions - receiver, defensive end,=20
fullback and some positions on the offensive line and at corner. It probabl=

isn't fair to question whether Mack Brown can motivate because his teams di=

and Texas falls apart the rest of the season, there will be a fair question=

=09
=09Brown said before the season that as soon as something went wrong, the=
=20
quarterback situation would be blamed. And he was right. The QBs are still=
=20
working hard, and look for Simms to start this week against Houston. There'=
s=20
no question that the O-line is struggling, but so are the backs and so are=
=20
the receivers. Brown said only two of the five sacks were the fault of the=
=20
line. He said the other three were caused by miscommunication between=20
Applewhite and the receivers, causing Applewhite to hold the ball too long.=
=20
=09
=09Mitchell was standing too deep in the backfield against Stanford, so it =
was=20
taking him too long to get to the holes. The coaches were not happy about=
=20
that. They were yelling at him to move up. He should only be 6 1/2 yards=20
deep. But he was sometimes at 9 yards. Mitchell also struggled with some=20
blitz pickup, which is uncharacteristic of him. So look for Victor Ike,=20
Hayter and possibly Williams to get a little time against Houston.=20
=09
=09Coaches are still high on Jammer. Again, he hasn't played corner much in=
=20
games after moving from safety. But coaches are not thinking of moving him.=
=20
The defensive end position is a big concern with defensive coordinator Carl=
=20
Reese. He is willing to rifle through his whole pile until he finds a coupl=
e=20
who can really play. Cory Redding was better than usual against Stanford. B=
ut=20
that position still needs a lot of work. The blocked punt occurred because=
=20
one player, who blocked perfectly on 11 other punts Saturday night, failed =
to=20
block a player coming right up the middle, which guarantees doom. That play=
er=20
has been chewed out every which way.
=09
=09As far as the penalties, there were several questionable calls. But Brow=
n,=20
who did a lot of yelling at officials during the Stanford game, couldn't sa=
y=20
anything about it after the game because he would be fined. Texas can still=

Darin - Great talking with you.

Mail the check to 11621 Rydalwater Lane, Austin, TX 78754-5720.

You wanted two season tix at $195 each and 4 OU tix at $55 each for a total
of $610.  I take it you didn't want any other individual game tickets.  (I
forgot to ask).

We'll find out about the OU tix in late August/early September.  If we
don't get them, we'll get a refund.

Congratulations.  Welcome back.  I sent you a note and a spreadsheet with the 
deals we have booked in our system.  I was trying to reconcile them to your 
list of deals.  I could not.  But I think the best thing to do is to simply 
start over and book the deals you tell me to.  I just need the exact terms.  
I know it's your first day back and you are probably swamped, but when you 
get a chance, please give me a call.  Richard wants me to have these deals 
valued by the end of this month's P&L.  Thanks.

Scott,

Richard Tomaski wants one more physical book set up under the Enovate name 
while retaining the other books already set up.  This counterparty name 
Enovate is replacing the Midwest Energy Hub.  But wants to be able to 
differentiate deals done as solely Enovate with deals done as Enron Midwest.  
Call me if you have any further questions, or if this presents a problem.  
Thanks.

The deal number in Sitara was changed because of an internal book name 
change.  It had nothing to do with the monetization status of the deal.  If 
this has caused a problem, let me know.  I didn't think that just changing 
the deal number would have this effect.   Thanks.

Any word?  I am going to send in the water fall today so please let me know.
Thanks

   

Darron, 

Sitara indicates that the below deal #10129 was changed to deal #312218.  
Steve Ross with Company 103 and my records indicate that this deal should 
have been monetized until September prod.  Please let me know if you show 
otherwise, as monetized volume stopped flowing as of July production.  

Thank you, Melissa

Melissa,
We are missing the CIG/NNG pull for deal 10129.  The 232,500 is south TX deal 
10132 which is booked.  Past history
has the 10129 deal pulling the same quantity as the 10132.   I am just trying 
to figure out were the other half of the monthly pull might be if in fact
there is any.  

Thanks

   

Steve, 

Please field all monetized questions/requests through me.  We have many new 
faces, most of which have not yet been trained on monetizations.  We are 
actually restructuring which coordinators will be handling the monetized 
contracts and once completed, we will have firm contacts for you. 

To answer your question, Wisconsin Electric Power deal #10132 and 10129 are 
still valid until 9/00, but I booked invoice #13470SA on your books in Doc 
#1600000445 for 232500 mmbtu and $1,011,549.39.  Is this not what you were 
looking for?  Please explain further.

Thanks!  Melissa

Is the CIG/NNG DUMAS contract expired?  My water fall is still looking for 
monthly MMBtu and there is none for July production
yielding  the above short fall.  Please let me know today as I am procesiing 
this months' payment.

Thanks

Regina,

I need two Sitara books set up in a new region.  The region can be called 
Enovate with the books IM Enovate and FT Enovate.  They are part of the other 
Chicago books:  Midwest, Midwest Program 1, and Midwest Program 2.  I have 
attached the book request I sent Susan Trevino.  Let me know if there is 
anything else I need to do.  I want to make sure that the books are not only 
in Sitara, but also in CPR for valuation purposes.  Thanks so much for your 
help.

Susan,

Attached is the completed book request form.  I just want to clarify a few 
things.  The first three books are for Tagg.  The last two are for Sitara.  I 
will need a region set up in CPR to hold the physical deals.  Do you do 
this?  Or can you point me in the right direction.  I really need this 
completed by the end of the week.  Let me know if there is something else I 
need to do.  Thanks for your help.

Jay,

There is still some cash in the custodial accounts.  I wanted you to buy more 
of the existing mutual funds.  Also, I am going to write a check out of my 
CMA account for more than the current cash balance.  Do I need to sell some 
mutual fund shares? Or is it automatic?  Let me know.  Nice game in Palo 
Alto.  Once again the Horns can't live up to the hype.

DG

No interns.  As long as my group stays intact I won't need anyone in August.  
I think Anne will stay past her 1 year and everyone else is relatively new.  
I do like having analysts though and think we would rather be long than short.

none of you want a Summer intern,  unless I hear otherwise.  I am mainly 
interested in what you think each of your groups will need in August.

your help.  Ted

Gary,

I need some Tagg books set up for the Chicago office.  I submitted a request 
this morning to create a new counterparty:  Enovate, LLC which will be an 
Enron entity.  Under Enovate LLC I need two books:  FT-ENOVATE and 
INTRA-ENOVATE (P,B,I & GD).  I also need a book which will fall under the 
current Enron MW, LLC counterparty:  FT-INT-ENOVATE (P,B,I & GD).  And as 
usual I need these as soon as possible.  I will be out of the office on 
Friday but will return on Monday.  I really need to get deals moved to these 
books by the end of next week.  Please let me know if there is anything I 
need to do to help.  Thanks as always.

I think I need some help reconciling what Steve Richman has and we have 
booked for the HUB deals.  He sent me a spreadsheet with deals but I cannot 
even come close to tying them out to what we have booked in Tagg.  Richard 
suggested I contact you since Steve is out.  Attached is a list of deals we 
currently have booked in Tagg for the HUB deals.  They need to be verified 
before I can calc them for value and positions.  I will be out tomorrow, 
returning on Monday.  Thanks for your help.  Please call me with any 
questions.

Please look over this and get back with me on any changes you would like to 
make.

I am going to set up a new counterparty in our system:  Enovate LLC.  Under 
this new counterparty will be 3 books in Tagg:  FT-ENOVATE, INTRA-ENOVATE, 
AND FT-INT-ENOVATE.  The INTRA-ENOVATE book will hold deals such as the 
Trunkline deal and will retain Rho & Drift.  The FT-ENOVATE book will be a 
flat book only used for  the confirmation process (deals must be in an FT 
book to be confirmed).  The FT-INT-ENOVATE book will pass Rho & Drift to the 
interest rate group.  This book will be used for EMW related deals not 
specific to Enovate.

The current entity Enron MW LLC will continue to be used and will have the 
following books in Tagg:  FT & Intra NSS1, FT & Intra NSS2, and FT & Intra 
TP.  FT and Intra MEH books will no longer be used.

The P&L will sum the 3 Enovate books to arrive at one number.  The other 
columns on the P&L(NSS1, NSS2, and TP) will be unaffected.

I had planned on just adding the Enovate books, but think we really need to 
set up a new entity as well.  I have run this by accounting and have their 
approval.  Let me know what you think and we will start the process.  We will 
have this completed by the end of this month.

Thanks.

Attached is a list of the Hub Deals we have currently in the system.  I tried 
to reconcile them to the sheet you sent me but could not.  Please take a look 
at these and give me a call.  Thanks.

Darin, this is a summary of the Park and Loan deals that you should have. I 
will need to talk to you regarding the Exchange deals that are included on 
the summary of expected revenues. The only exchange that should be recorded 
under enovate should be the enron exchange for $5,000. In that exchange PGL 
Hub received molecules in June and returned them in July, ratable. Other than 
that, if you have any questions call me at 312-541-1233.

Thanks-Steve Richman

Barbara Dillard's worksheet shows the full 10,000 MMBtu for 8/1/00 - 8/2/00 
as SIQ (see below) which is priced at NGPL.ILL-CITYGATE.NGI.M.I - .02 USD, 
not tier priced as shown below in Sitara.  Unless there's some reason I'm not 
aware of, can you please change the full volume to be priced at 
NGPL.ILL-CITYGATE.NGI.M.I - .02 USD.

Thanks,
Kevin

I am in the process of getting these deals valued.  I know what we have 
booked in Tagg as of now, but need to reconcile it to what People's has 
booked.  I got something from Steve last time I was up, but it does not have 
deal terms.  Could you ask Steve for a list that has the terms of each deal?  
I don't even know his last name.  Thanks.

I have not received a response from Darron and I do not want to remove the 
demand charge unless he agrees.

   

Any word on this yet?

Do you agree in removing demand charge on deal 279644.

Please remove the demand charge of $11,700.00 for Metropolitan Utilities 
District for June 2000. The Sitara number is 279644. Please let me know when 
you have finished. Thank you.

I hope you have a great day.  I love you.

Did you grant the $750 in orig from the ticket I gave you yesterday?  Let me 
know.  Thanks.

Darron,
I did not see this origination amount from Luchas.

thanks,

You should see this from Luchas tonight.

Central origination claimed $750 more than what was granted to them.  

Thanks,

Susan,

Do you have a ticket for the above referenced deal?  I am trying to find 
Sitara numbers, but I don't have a ticket for the deal.  Let me know.  Thanks.

I totally forgot about the weekly meeting.  Sorry.  Like I said yesterday, 
I'm working on getting new books set up for Chicago.  I just need to 
follow-up with Mary Lynn on Friday before I submit requests.  I'm also 
working on OA issues for July.  I will teach a class on Thursday and next 
Tuesday to settlements about OA (just basics like desk price, customer price, 
and liquidations).  In addition, I need to ask you a few questions about the 
Trunkline deal.  When I meet with Mary Lynn on Friday, I am going to explain 
the deal to her.  That's about it.  Once again, I apologize about missing the 
meeting today.

Kristi wanted me to send you a note saying we will be there for the game on 
Saturday.  See you there.

Darron, I believe you were ask about this last month.  it is still causing a 
pricing difference this month too.  Please call me so we can staighten out 
the deal or you can call Laura Scott in Canada and argue your point.  This is 
on open OA difference and will continue to be until you handle it.

I was able to change the first deal in Sitara, but the other pricing request 
I did not feel comfortable making any changes.  Would you please look at this 
pricing issue for Client Services since they need to get it paid on Monday.

Please correct the following deals:

Enron Canada purchase deal # 121397  Was 4.18427 should be 4.10185  This is 
due to a Buy/back at Chippawa which reduces our Sithe transport by 
$70,191.70   I normally book this manually (with Journal entry) but with SAP, 
it needs to be in Unify and this is the only deal I can book it to.  The 
Sithe transport is in Canadian dollars and this reduction is in US $.

Also I have the following deals which are scheduled different on our side 
that Enron Canada and causes me about a $500 out of balance each month.  We 
have netted this with other out of balances in previous months but with SAP, 
I can no longer do this. Here is what happens:

ENA Books:  Purchase Deal 290657  for 30,390  MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.-.005 = $4,125,442.50
            Sale Deal 290652 for     ( 5,000) MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.-.0075=    678,375.00
                                                                              
  Total          $3,447,067.50
                                                                        
Enron Canada Books:

            Sale                  for 20,000 MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.-.005=   $2,715,000.00
  Sale                  for  5,390 MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.     =      732,501.00
                                                                              
  Total          $3,447,501.00

I don't know why we book a purchase and sale but it messes up the deal in 
SAP.  Can we change the ENA sale deal 290652 to posting -.005 and the ENA 
purchase deal # 290657 tier it for 25,000 at Posting -.005 and balance at 
posting.  Let me know as soon as possible.  I need to pay this AM on Monday.

Thanks, Jane

More Deals.

Thanks for your assistance and that of Jeff.   In addition to the 8 trades 
sent yesterday (see below), which Jeff is assisting on the offsetting 
positions, we have another done on March 7, 2001  ticket # QV8401.1, please 
add it to the list.

At year end Ron Baker worked with your group to document the offsetting third 
party positions on the following trades.

NI8156.1
NK4742.1
NT6154.1
NV5358.1

I understand that as a result of that work about 97 third party trades were 
identified to offset these 4 Transwestern trades.  Somehow an effectiveness 
test was done.  We were not involved in any of that work and I hope all 97 
trades (If that is the correct number) are still on ENA's books and are still 
effective.  At this time I don't see how I can measure effectiveness without 
the third party positions in our books.  Can ENA met the effectiveness 
standard and measurement requirements of SFAS 133 or is it the responsibility 
of the business unit that originated the hedge.  At this time we are only 
measuring our own positions.   Roger, indicated in the below memo that Ernie 
was going to do the effectiveness testing.   

We need your advice on if we should continue hedging positions with ENA.  I 
am concerned that ETS does not have the ability to monitor and maintain 
effectiveness when ENA facilitates the transaction because ETS loses control 
of the offseting 3rd party position.   I was under the impression that 
intercompany trades were kept in an affiliate book.  Perhaps we can get 
together next week and work out documentation procedures and the use of the 
affiliate book.  Anyday except Monday. 

Thanks,  Dan

Jeff,

I hope you can help me with this.  I need to find a way to identify 
offsetting 3rd party derivative transactions relating to the internal trades 
done with TW for the following deals:

TW RMTC QL2915.1
TW RMTC QL2918.1
  
  
TW RMTC QL5424.1
TW RMTC QL5444.1
  
  
TW RMTC QL5357.1
TW RMTC QL5358.1
  
  
TW RMTC QL9270.1
TW RMTC QL9273.1

Tiffany Miller identified you as the person that did this for our deals with 
ENA earlier.  Please let me know as soon as possible, if you can help.  If 
not, do you have any suggestions?

Roger G Leworthy@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT

Dan/Bob,
Following my voice mail message (to Dan), I want to circle back on the 
accounting impact of the recent internal transportation derivatives between 
TW and RMTC.

The concern that has arisen is that TW has taken the "out-of-the-money" 
impact of these trades (approx. $27MM) to OCI while RMTC has marked the 
"in-the-money" impact through income.

TW has taken its impact to OCI because it is, on a standalone accounts basis, 
designating these internal trades in cash flow hedge relationships.

However, from an Enron consolidated financial position viewpoint, the 
internal trades cannot be designated as hedges (and, thus, would need to be 
reversed which would have a negative impact on earnings of $27MM).

So, in order not to have this negative impact, 3rd party "offset" 
transactions in ENA must be identified and documented as cash flow hedge 
transactions.

It may be that RMTC has already identified offsetting 3rd party derivative 
transactions relating to the internal trades done with TW. 

However, if not, we think that the best place for responsibility for getting 
these 3rd party trades IDENTIFIED AND PROPERLY DOCUMENTED IN CASH FLOW HEDGE 
RELATIONSHIPS is with the business unit that wanted the internal trade in the 
first place - i.e. TW in this case.

If this has not already been done, can you have someone in your shop work 
with ENA to identify and obtain copies of sufficient 3rd party trades that 
hedge the risk hedged by TW. Once this is accomplished, Enron Corp. 
consolidated hedge documentation needs to be established as a matter of 
urgency; again, we consider this responsibility is best placed in the BU 
using the internal trade as a hedge. In this regard, Ernie (effectiveness 
testing) and I will be available to assist with this documentation.

Please do not hesitate to advise comments or questions on this matter. I am 
preparing the FAS 133 impact 3/31 Pro-Formas based on the identification and 
development of the consolidated hedge documentation.

Roger

Kevin,

I just wanted to mention a few things.  I'm sure you are doing them already 
most of the time, but they really need to be done on each and every deal.

Link all physical Tagg deals by putting the Sitara number in the LINK field
Put the Tagg number in the comments section of any Sitara deal also booked in 
Tagg
Put the Tagg number in SCI for any Sitara deal also booked in Tagg
Put the EOL number in Sitara and/or Tagg for every EOL deal
Also, in Tagg there is a System of Origin field - Select Enron on Line for 
every EOL deal
Manually rebook every EOL deal that fails - If you have trouble doing this, 
just let me know and I'll follow up.

Thanks.

for the weekend of November 11th.  I plan on taking the whole group up for 
the KU-UT game.  I hope you will be in town as well.  Let me know.  Take care.

Uncle Clark,

How are things?  I hope this note finds you well.  I wanted to see if you 
were going to be in town for the weekend of November 11th.  I plan on 
bringing the whole group up for the KU-UT game that weekend.  I can't believe 
it has almost been 4 years since we last visited up there.  We are doing well 
here in Houston.  Everyone is getting ready for the school year.  In fact, 
Kristi has already started back.  The kids begin on the 9th.  Enron still 
seems to monopolize my time.  But it's a great place to work.  Let me know 
about that weekend.  I hope you will be in town as  I am looking forward to 
seeing you all.

reimbursement should be the following:

Commodity $.0594
Fuel  $.054 (Assuming GD Tenn/500 = $2.775 (Mar 15), and Tennessee Fuel % = 
1.91%)
Total  $.1134

The commodity was adjusted to recover the Tennessee pipeline commodity costs

Elizabeth:

Darin Giron called me about the EOL park and loan deal from Friday. These 
deals will cause differences with your EOL-Sitara reconciliation. The EOL 
deal will error out in Spreadsheet - Natural Gas, therefore you won't see it 
erroring out under Sitara. The EOL Park and Loan deal should be booked as 
four deals in Sitara. These Park and Loan deals should be booked as two 
exchange deals (one receipt and one delivery) between ENA and the third 
party. And then two desk to desk deals between ENA and EMW. The EOL deal 
number should be referenced on both of the exchange deals. Darin booked EOL 
deal 330098 as two physical forwards (348347 and 348364) and two desk to 
desks (348362 and 348375). He is going to create the two exchange deals and 
kill the two physical forwards and reference the EOL deals numbers on the 
exchange deals. 

Let me know if you have any questions.

This is a draft/preliminary document

Brent & Jeff,

Attached is the Draft Transaction Flow Process for MEH.  Could you review and 
comment on any inconsistency between the MEH doc. and the ENA Process.  Also 
Gregg Penman was hoping you could expand on the names associated with the 
responsibilitites, as well as any other comments would be appreciated.

Thanks,  

I changed the counterparty name in Tagg

Darron,

 Could you please make sure that this deal was really done with Dynegy Eenrgy 
Resources, Limited in EOL.  We think it should have been done at Dynegy 
Marketing and Trade.

Gregg,
I used the following counterparties in the query:

Central Illinois Public Service Company
Central Illinois Light Company
Illinois Power Company
Northern Indiana Public Service Company
Nicor, Inc.
Nicor Energy LLC.
Nicor Enerchange LLC.
Nicor Gas Company
Nicor Gas Marketing Company
Nipsco Industries, Inc.
Nipsco Energy Services, Inc.
NiSource Capital Markets, Inc.

The only deals I came up with were with Nicor.  If you have any questions, 
don't hesitate to call me.

DG    3-9573

   
	
	

Thanks for the list of existing transactions.  Only one question, it looks 
like the list includes only the different corporate entities of NICOR.  Does 
that mean that there were no existing transactions with the other Corporate 
families, i.e. NIPSCO, CILCO, PGL and NS?

Thanks,

Gregg
	
	

Gregg,

Attached is a list (forwards detail by risk type) disclosing all the deals 
that Darron could come
up with given your parameters.

Glad the risk management group could be of some assistance.

Jay,

I looked over the info you forwarded but have decided to just buy two mutual 
funds.  Unless you have a better suggestion, buy APGCX and MCGTX.  And I 
really mean it when I say if you have a better suggestion let me know.  It 
looks like the transfers worked properly.  But are the automatic purchases of 
mutual funds in place?  I don't see the activity on the web page.  Lastly, 
and I think this is just administrative stuff, Kristi's Roth IRA does not 
show up on the web or on the statements we receive in the mail.  Thanks.

Hey Darron,

What's going on??  Just wanted to say thanks for inviting me to go out on
the boat last weekend.  Hope I was not rude when we were leaving, but I
really started to feel like crap.  When we got back to Scott's I almost
puked a couple times and was stuck on the crapper for some time.  I ended up
not going to work on Monday and half of Tuesday because of the hebee jebees.
Anyway, if you ever need anyone to help you with the boat when you go out
(uh, yeah), give me a call and I would be glad to 'help' out.

Mike

Thanks.

It seems as if I have caused some confusion.  Last night's email attachment 
was the P&L that did not include People's or Origination's share of the 
total.  Currently attached is the P&L that was signed off on last night.  If 
you have any questions, please call.

Dear all-

I wanted to follow up with you to see if you had started using the Exception 
reporting databases.  I know that initially we had some security problems, 
but I think that we resolved those.  I have not seen any files for the gas 
group, so I wanted to follow up.  Please let me know or if you have any 
problems, please let myself (ext. 31781) or Kelly (ext. 39962) know.  Thanks, 

Christy

Jay,

I have the following transfers in place on a recurring basis beginning

$175/mo from 226-27209 into 226-27210
$150/mo from 226-27209 into 226-27211

I would like to make monthly purchases (with the net amount transferred) of 
the existing mutual funds in each of the three accounts.

Buy $740/mo of APGCX in 226-27209
Buy $175/mo of APGCX in 226-27210
Buy $150/mo of APGCX in 226-27211

Here is Agave for June.  I also made a change to May.  I was calculating the 
differential off of the wrong location index.

I was wondering why you were waiting so long to respond.  I'm glad he is 
staying.  I think it says something about his commitment to the program he 
built.  It also says a little about the Big XII.  How are things in CO?  I'm 
in Chicago now but am heading for LA later this afternoon for Carlos&Y's 
shower.  Take care.

I'm in Chicago now but I need to ask you some questions about a few Sitara 
deals.  They are 298277, 298283, and 298296.  They are between EPMI and EMW.  
Are these deasl going to be settled by Unify?  Do we currently see Unify 
invoices/verifications for EMW or EPMI?  Thanks.

Counterparty.  Once
the book is added to Global Counterparty, an e-mail is sent to Ricky Dang 
from Global
and he adds to to TAGG.

Give me a call if you have any questions.

Thanks, Ron

Please add the following book to Tagg:

If you need any additional information, please call.  Thanks.

Actually, I also remember that it is composed of the first three letters of 
his mother and father's name. Something I
learned, I think, almost before he could spell it.  Gad,
we're getting old.

Darron,  I saw two or three software manager and an IT
manager positions at the Enron web site.  They look like
something I might be interested in doing if everything
could work out.  Can we talk about Enron when you return?

Hey guys - I am going to have a July 4th celebration at my house (but not on 
the 4th - it will be on the 3rd - Monday).  Kids are welcome, although I 
can't promise things will remain under control all day!!!!  

I am going to get a keg of beer for us, but feel free to bring your beverage 
of choice.  I thought we would grill burgers and hot dogs - so just bring 
your own meat, and I will take care of all the sides.  Feel free to bring 
whatever you want for munchies....plan on an all day/night affair!

Call me if you need directions!  Let me know if you can make it so I can make 
sure I have enough food and drinks!

By the way, I do not have any furniture downstairs, so bring lawnchairs!

	
	

Darron,

I am forwarding to you some info on the NSS transaction.  I don't know if you 
are interested or not but here it is.

 
	
	

Tim,

The document attached directly below this verbage is what I included to our 
risk folks as we discovered
that the way we were booking NSS was not correct.  Below this attachment is 
our risk director's independent
solution to the problem; you will note that it is the same conclusion that we 
(Richard and myself) came up with
(see the e-mail I sent at the very bottom of this e-mail).  

Hopefully this will help.

Kevin

Kevin, your not going to believe me but as soon as I got your revised E-Mail, 
I had the answer for you.

   
	
	

Richard, Lee, and myself met this afternoon and reviewed the memo I prepared 
intending to find and propose a solution
to our existing valuation problem.   We think we have the answer.  We would 
appreciate any comments from our risk experts.

The following change to our existing deal is what we think will solve the 
problem.  All that we are doing is changing the fixed
price on Legs 2 and 3 to 0.  If you refer to the example mentioned in my 
earlier memo, you will note that the p/l attributable to 
this deals should be 52,777; by changing these legs to 0 we accomplish this 
end result.  

     

I look forward to any feedback any of you may have to offer.

Stephanie,

We are breaking up our Central Midcon region into two books beginning July 
1.  To facilitate this, Sitara has set up two new internal books:  ENA-IM Mid 
Central South & ENA-IM Mid Central North.  It would be helpful if we could 
have any physical June EOL deals continue to be booked to ENA-IM Central but 
all physical July-out deals booked to the new books.  The two traders 
involved are Kelli Stevens and Ed Smith.

 Kelli Stevens ENA-IM Mid Central South
 Ed Smith ENA-IM Mid Central North

Please let me know if there is anything else I need to do to expedite this 
request.  Thanks for your help.

coming out of any book. Could you let me know who granted that. 

I know  0.5  (thousand) were granted by the NG Price, but I could not fine 
anything else. Also, if you could please look into the 468 (dollars) that I 
mentioned on my previous email, I would appreciate it.

What to Expect From Gun Control

 these are the facts right out of the history books

 Interesting bit of information.

 "In 1929, the Soviet Union established gun control. From 1929 to

 1953, about 20 million dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were

 rounded up and exterminated.

 "In 1911, Turkey established gun control. From 1915 to 1917, 1.5

 million Armenians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and

 exterminated.

 "Germany established gun control in 1938 and from 1939 to 1945, 13 million

 Jews and others who were unable to defend themselves were rounded up and

 exterminated.

 "China established gun control in 1935. From 1948 to 1952, 20 million

 political dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and

 exterminated.

 "Guatemala established gun control in 1964. From 1964 to 1981, 100,000

 Mayan Indians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and

 exterminated.

 "Uganda established gun control in 1970. From 1971 to 1979, 300,000

 Christians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.

 "Cambodia established gun control in 1956. From 1975 to 1977, one

 million 'educated' people, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up

and exterminated."

 Defenseless people rounded up and exterminated in the 20th Century

 because of gun control: 56 million.

 The next time someone talks in favor of gun control, ask them "Who do

 YOU want to round up and exterminate?" With guns, we are citizens. Without

 them, we are subjects.

Jay,

I want to set up a monthly automatic transfer from my checking account but 
have had trouble getting a PIN number from the phone number that was mailed 
to me.  I want to have $1,065 transferred into the CMA account; on the 15th 
of each month if possible.  I would like $150 transferred into 226-27211 and 
then used to purchase the mutual fund already in the account, $175 
transferred into 226-27210 and then used to purchase the mutual fund already 
in the account, and then have the remaining amount ($740) used to purchase 
the mutual fund in the CMA account (226-27209).  Please help.  Thanks.

If you have any questions, please call.  Also, will you please send me the 
latest version of the Central curve mappings.  Thanks.

Instead of sending $ in and pulling $ out every month, I am going to stop 
sending $ into the CMA account starting this month.  I actually have already 
done this on the web.  What I need you to do is to stop the monthly purchase 
of APGCX for $340 begining this month.  Also, any idea if I am going to 
receive a 1099 for the recharacterization of the IRAs?  I noticed online 
that  the Roths are now zero.  Thanks.

The Sitara group is getting prepared to be converting all cash desk financial 
deals into Sitara.  Could you have someone send me a list of the different 
books used in Tagg to book deals for the Central cash desk.  We are also 
working on an application to display the risks on the physical deals booked in
Sitara.  Could you also have sent to me a list of the different regions that 
your desk wants to have its physical positions broken up into.

If you have any questions, please call me.

I don't believe I am set up to review as a supervisor in the PEP system.  How 
do I get this changed in the system?  Let me know.  Thanks
DG

Jeff,
If we give these reviews in late Jan or Feb of next year, I think I could 
review Chris, Jason, Anne, and Jennifer.  I don't think I should review Dawn, 
Greg, or Kim.  Although, if I were in their shoes, I would want you involved 
in some capacity.  What do you think?

DG    3-9573

   

Don't forget to send me the names of the people that you intend on reviewing.

Thanks

The Chicago region is just me.  If you need my salary, let me know.  I travel

It is amazing and yet not surprising how much Enron has accomplished in the=

that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron=01,s business goals, and w=

As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as t=

Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package=

success.  Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and=
=20
Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decid=
ed=20
to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package.

On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for=

calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program).  =
It is=20
expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be granted,=

effective on or about December 29, 2000, for those employees who are eligib=

on that date (please see note below).  The new program, which is subject to=

final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, is as follows:

? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to=20
eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and=20
international companies/locations.
? The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base=20

December 29, 2000. (Salary calculation and value may vary in some=20

of stock options.

Why commit your talent and energy to Enron?  EnronOptions =01) Your Stock O=

In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions =

You can get good speaker packages, but many of them are not really good.  
I'll bring some magazines that have articles on some good speaker sets.  You 
can also just put your own package together.  If you do this make sure the 
speakers are of the same brand.  This is what I did for Scott.  Many of the 
speaker packages use  5 small speakers and a sub.  But I suggested larger 
front L&R speakers to Scott for playing music.  Any decent receiver will have 
a decoder built in.  And I do have some brand names, but it really depends on 
how much you are willing to spend.  I'll go through my stash of magazines 
tonight and see what I can find for you to read.

DG

Mike Fultz <Mike.Fultz@HALLIBURTON.com> on 04/05/2001 04:30:53 PM
Scott,

Did you buy your surround sound speakers as a package
(left/right/center/surround left/surround right/subwoofer) or did you buy
all the speakers separately.  I would like to buy them all as a package or
maybe all but the subwoofer and buy that separately.  What did you do??  I
have seen some pretty cool JBL Speaker Packages.

Also, what reciever did you get? Even though your DVD player has a decoder
built in, I am assuming that your reciever has a decoder built in also.

Darron, any advice on what brand speakers/receiver etc. and where to get??

Texas Baby 

A Texan buys a round of drinks for all in  the bar?because, he announces
his wife has just produced "a typical  Texas baby boy weighing 25 pounds."
Congratulations shower him from all  around, and many?exclamations of
"Wow!" are heard. A woman faints due  to?sympathy pains 

Two weeks later, he returns to the bar. The  bartender?says, "Say,
you're the father of the typical Texas  baby?that weighed 25 pounds at
birth. How much does he weigh now?"  

The proud father answers, "Seventeen pounds." 

The bartender is  puzzled, concerned. "Why? What?happened? He already
weighed 25 pounds at  birth." 

The Texas father takes a slow swig from his long-neck?Lone  Star, wipes
his lips on his shirtsleeve, leans into?the bartender and  proudly
says,? "Had him circumcised."

Orientation Date:  July 2, 2001

Candidate(s):		Monte Jones

In order for this orientation to be a success we will need your support with several items:

Clear the candidate's work schedule to accommodate this orientation plan. - Orientation is now 8 AM to 12 PM

NEW INFORMATION:

There has been a change in the orientation program for new employees.  From now on it will only last a half day and they will no longer get a lunch.  This makes it more important than ever to ensure that each new employee has a buddy assigned and ready to go.

It will be the buddy's responsibility to pick the new employee up after orientation, get them some lunch and deliver them to their work station on Monday afternoon.

Whenever an employee is hired, a buddy is selected.  Once we are notified of who the buddy is, we send them an e-mail describing what they need to do.

Provide a "Buddy" to employee.  The Buddy will need to pick the employee up on Monday (EB5C2) at 11:55 PM.
	

*** A BUDDY MUST BE PROVIDED***

Please forward Buddy name and extension to me by Thursday at noon.

Thanks,
Candace

A philosophy professor stood before his class and had some items in front of
him. When the class began, wordlessly he picked up a large empty mayonnaise
jar and proceeded to fill it with rocks, rocks about 2" in diameter. He then
asked the students if the jar was full? They agreed that it was.

So the professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the
jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles, of course, rolled into the open
areas between the rocks. He then asked the students again if the jar was
full. They agreed it was. The students laughed.

The professor picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course,
the sand filled up everything else. "Now," said the professor, "I want you
to recognize that this is your life. The rocks are the important things -
your family, your partner, your health, your children - things that if
everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be
full.

The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your house, your
car. The sand is everything else. The small stuff."

"If you put the sand into the jar first, there is no room for the pebbles or
the rocks. The same goes for your life. If you spend all your time and
energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are
important to you. Pay attention to the things that are critical to your
happiness. Play with your children. Take time to get medical checkups. Take
your partner out dancing. There will always be time to go to work, clean the
house, give a dinner party and fix the disposal."

"Take care of the rocks first - the things that really matter. Set your
priorities. The rest is just sand."

But then... A particularly adept student took the jar which the other
students and the professor agreed was full, and proceeded to pour in a glass
of beer. Of course the beer filled the remaining spaces within the jar
making the jar truly full.

The student said " You know, no matter how full your life is of big and
small things, there is always room in it for BEER."

Jim,
After our conversation on the phone yesterday, I confirmed that we are not able to provide delivered gas at the citygate for a competitive price.  Therefore we do not wish to make an offer of this package at this time.  Thanks for your consideration.
				Sincerely,

				Darron Giron

I may be in Austin later this summer.  I'm in no hurry to get the tickets.  If you will, please hang on to them and I'll advise at a later date.  Thanks.

DG

Darin - The season tickets are in; OU tickets will be mailed later.  How do
you want to pick them up?  Any plans to be in Austin, soon?

How goes it?  I hope good.  I just found out that Enron is making Sprint Broadband Direct available to us at a discounted rate.  Isn't this the group you are working for now?  They will install the equipment for free and charge $24/mo ($14/mo if you sign up for Sprint Long Distance).  Do you have this?  If so, how do you like it?  Did you hear about Jessie?  Anyway, I just wanted to ask you about this.  I have dial-up now and it really sucks, but I'm a tight-wad and didn't want to pay what DSL costs.  Take Care.

DG

FYI...My latest check stub does not reflect a change in pay.

A lady walked into a pharmacy & spoke to the 
Pharmacist........... 

She asked: "Do you have viagara?" 

"Why yes," he answered............. 

She asked, "Does it work?" 

"Why yes!!!!!!!" He answered. 

"Can you get it over the counter?" she asked...... 

"I can if I take two," he answered. 

It looks like we won't make it to Austin before the 1st.  I'll probably just ask you to leave the tix under your front door matt on the day of the NMSU game and we will stop by to pick them up.  I will verify this with you next week.  I can't believe the season is already upon us.  Any word on OU?

Thanks

I believe it was $610.  That was (2X$195) + (4X$55).  The two I have are Sec 15 Row 18 Seats 1&2.

I meant season tix.  But would probably also try to get OU as well.  I guess I'm wrestling with the idea of getting them in my name, but I know the seat location would not be very good.  I really would like to have 4 season ticket seats together.  I have been getting these through you for 6 years now and don't have a problem with just continuing this arrangement.  I also wouldn't be opposed to helping with the contribution to the Foundation if you think it would help.  Let me know.

DG

Darron - sorry - My hard drive crashed two weeks ago and I lost my records
of who did what and how much.  Good news is I should get my restoration
back this week.  Tell me what your OU seats were so I can pair them with
seats close by, or exchange them for four together.

I vaguely remember us talking about OU.  Do you remember how much you paid
me?

When you say two additional tix for next season, do you mean season and OU
or just one or the other?  The only way you can get more OU seats than your
season tix is if someone else in the group doesn't want to buy OU tix with
their season tix.

I'm glad they arrived so quickly.

We'll get it worked out

I didn't think about it from your point of view and if some day I decide not to help anymore then you get hurt because your contribution falls.  So just disregard that suggestion. 

I guess I'm trying to feel you out about the possibility of continuing this current arrangement long-term.  Because I will commit to purchase the current two (and would like to get two more for a total of 4) from now on.  It really would be better for me to continue this arrangement rather than get them on my own, because like you indicated, I would have to really pony up alot of $$ to keep similar seats.  I'm just not sure what your plans would be for my current tickets and if at some point you would like them back for yourself.  How did you end up with so many?  Is Mark still getting the two next to mine?  Just curious.  Don't worry about the OU tix,  I will find you on Saturday.  Thanks as always.

DG

I got my files restored and indeed had you down for four OU tix.  So sorry.
Let's try to hook up Saturday.

I wouldn't mind help with the Foundation contribution, but the downside all
belongs to you.  I could practically guarantee that if you were to split
away and create your own foundation giving you'd get knocked out of your
seats unless you jumped in at the $2500 level/yr or higher.  Any money
given to me would not be qualified for a tax credit for you.  And if you
decide in the future to start anyway, you lose all the prior years
cumulative giving where you didn't start.  Any any money you gave me
wouldn't mean we'd be guaranteed better OU tix (or season tix) because I
would lower my personal contribution by the same amount.  I don't want to
be on the hook for the extra contribution should you decide in the future
to stop helping.  That said, that may not be important for you and you
won't mind sending me dollars.

I know I wouldn't be getting OU tix at all if it wasn't for my contribution
to the Foundation.  Not all Foundation members are getting OU tix any more,
so I continue to consider myself lucky to continue getting tickets at all.

Your choice!

Darron.C.Giron@enron.com on 08/27/2001 03:33:17 PM

I believe it was $610.  That was (2X$195) + (4X$55).  The two I have are
Sec 15 Row 18 Seats 1&2.

I meant season tix.  But would probably also try to get OU as well.  I
guess I'm wrestling with the idea of getting them in my name, but I know
the seat location would not be very good.  I really would like to have 4
season ticket seats together.  I have been getting these through you for 6
years now and don't have a problem with just continuing this arrangement.
I also wouldn't be opposed to helping with the contribution to the
Foundation if you think it would help.  Let me know.

   Darron - sorry - My hard drive crashed two weeks ago and I lost my
   records
   of who did what and how much.  Good news is I should get my restoration
   back this week.  Tell me what your OU seats were so I can pair them with
   seats close by, or exchange them for four together.

   I vaguely remember us talking about OU.  Do you remember how much you
   paid
   me?

   When you say two additional tix for next season, do you mean season and
   OU
   or just one or the other?  The only way you can get more OU seats than
   your
   season tix is if someone else in the group doesn't want to buy OU tix
   with
   their season tix.

   I'm glad they arrived so quickly.

   We'll get it worked out

   I just got the tickets.  Thanks for sending them.  I paid for 4 OU
   tickets,
   could you only get me 2?  Let me know.  I also wanted to ask you about
   the
   possibility of getting 2 additional tickets for next season.  I know you
   get quite a few each year, but don't know if you have extras available.

I am happy with my seats.  I just wanted to make sure you were willing to continue allowing me to buy them through you long term.  See you Saturday.  They should be pretty good this year.  But I've certainly heard that before!

DG

I'm certainly OK with the arrangement long term if you're happy with your
seats.  I would have liked to get you down lower, but that won't be
possible today without a much larger contribution.

And I'm OK with you helping with the foundation contribution - you just
won't get any recognition from Texas or from the IRS with that arrangement.
And with the job market these days, there might come a time when I can't
continue my own level of giving and then everyone will have to make a
decision.   I'd lower my giving so that the total contribution was level
year after year.  If and when you decided to stop, I'd have to start making
up the difference again to keep my seats on row 3.  Or I'd be bumped
somewhere.

I got this many because people started asking about getting tickets - this
is probably how a lot of people do it.  I'm not sure today if I could add
any more to the general area where everyone is.  Sheila and Mark are still
getting tix.

Darron.C.Giron@enron.com on 08/30/2001 11:23:27 AM

I didn't think about it from your point of view and if some day I decide
not to help anymore then you get hurt because your contribution falls.  So
just disregard that suggestion.

I guess I'm trying to feel you out about the possibility of continuing this
current arrangement long-term.  Because I will commit to purchase the
current two (and would like to get two more for a total of 4) from now on.
It really would be better for me to continue this arrangement rather than
get them on my own, because like you indicated, I would have to really pony

you in time.  Give me your work/home numbers again.

Thanks for getting the OU tickets to me on Saturday.  Do you have any
extras for the Kansas game?  I have Jayhawk relatives coming for the game.
Let me know.  The D and SP look pretty good.  I hope they are holding
something back on O.  We'll see.  Thanks.

The CODE (rules for men): 

1. Thou shall not rent 'Chocolat'. 

2. Under no circumstances may 2 men share an umbrella. 

3. Any man who brings a camera to a bachelor party may be legally killed and
eaten by his fellow partygoers. 

4. When you are queried by a buddy's wife, girlfriend, mother, father,
priest, shrink, dentist, accountant, or dog walker, you need not and should
not provide any useful information whatsoever as to his whereabouts. You are

permitted to deny his very existence. 
 
5. Unless he murdered someone in your immediate family, you must bail a
friend out of jail within 12 hours. 

6. You may exaggerate any anecdote told in a bar by 50 percent without
recrimination; beyond that, anyone within 
earshot is allowed to call bullshit. (Exception:  When trying to pick up a
girl, the allowable exaggeration rate rises to 400 percent) 

7. If you've known a guy for more than 24 hours, his sister is off-limits
forever. 

8. The minimum amount of time you have to wait for another guy who's running
late is 5 minutes. For a girl, you are required to wait 10 minutes for every
point of hotness she scores on the classic 1-10 scale. 

9. Bitching about the brand of free beer in a buddy's refrigerator is
forbidden. You may gripe if the temperature is unsuitable. 

10. No man is ever required to buy a birthday present for another man. (In
fact, even remembering a friend's birthday is strictly optional.) 

11. Agreeing to distract the ugly friend of a hot babe your buddy is trying
to hook up with is your legal duty.  Should you get carried away with your
good deed and end up having sex with the beast, your pal is forbidden to
speak of it, even at your bachelor party. 

12. Before dating a buddy's ex, you are required to ask his permission; and
he, in return, is required to grant it. 

13. Women who claim they "love to watch sports" must be treated as spies
until they demonstrate knowledge of the game and the ability to pick a
buffalo wing clean. 

14. If a man's zipper is down, that's his problem  - you didn't see nothin'.

15. The universal compensation for buddies who help you move is beer. 

16. A man must never own a cat or like his girlfriend's cat.  

17. You girlfriend must bond with your buddy's girlfriends within 30 minutes
of meeting them. You are not required to make nice with her gal pals'
significant dick-heads --- low-level sports bonding is all the law requires.

18. When stumbling upon other guys watching a sports event, you may always
ask the score of the game in progress, but you may never ask who's playing. 

19. When your girlfriend / wife expresses a desire to fix her whiney friend
with your pal, you may give her the go-ahead only if you'll be able to warn
your buddy and give him time prepare excuses about joining the priesthood. 

20. (Gas Warfare Act) you may flatuate in front of a woman only after you've
brought her to climax. But, if you trap her head under the covers for the
purpose of flatuent entertainment, she's officially your girlfriend. 

21. It is permissible to consume a fruity chick drink only when you're
sunning on a tropical beach...And it's delivered by a topless
supermodel...and it's free. 

22. Unless you're in prison, never fight naked. 
 
23. A man in the company of a hot, suggestively dressed woman must remain
sober enough to fight. 
 
24. If a buddy is outnumbered, outmanned, or too drunk to fight, you must
jump into the fight. Exception: If within the last 24 hours his actions have
caused you to think, "What this guy needs is a good ass-whoopin," you may
sit back and enjoy. 

25. Friends don't let friends wear Speedo's. Ever.  Issue closed. 

26. Phrases that may NOT be uttered to another man while weight lifting:
"Yeah, baby, push it!" "C'mon, give me one more! Harder!"  "Another set and
we can hit the showers." "Nice ass, are you a Sagittarius?" 

27. Never hesitate to reach for the last beer or the last slice of pizza,
but not both.  That's just plain mean. 

28. If you compliment a guy on his six-pack, you better be referring to his
beer. 

29. Never join your girlfriend / wife in dissings a buddy, except when she's
withholding sex pending your response. 

30. Never talk to a man in the bathroom unless you're on equal footing: Both
urinating or both waiting in line. In all other situations, a nod is all the
conversation you need. 
 
31. If a buddy is already singing along to a song in the car, you may not
join him  ...too gay. 

32. Before allowing a drunken friend to cheat on his girl, you must attempt
one intervention. If he is able to get on his feet, look you in the eye, and
deliver a "F@CK OFF!" You are absolved of your of responsibility. 

33. The morning after you and a babe who was formerly "just a friend" have
carnal, drunken monkey sex, the fact that you're feeling weird and guilty is
no reason not to nail her again before the discussion about what a big
mistake it was. 

34. In Black Jack, always split aces and eight's.  No arguments.

More than 6,000 (more than 4,000 American citizens) innocent civilians have been killed in a brutal attack on our country and our way of life.  If that is not worth fighting for, then what in your opinion is?  I will admit, I am a conservative and therefore our opinions will usually be polarized on many issues.  I am glad that life in our country allows for dissent.  But I think that this right is worth the ulimate sacrifice.  I honestly believe that if we do not respond, and with calculated deadly force, that we ultimately lose.  And I am not talking about losing a war, but our freedom.  I agree with you that war will bring unintended consequenses, but these consequences in my opinion, are the price we must pay to defend our way of life.

Darron Giron

Congratulations on the latest member of the family.  Kim sent me an email with website address that has the pictures.  I hope everyone is doing well.  Take care.

Assuming this is accurate, I would like to get from you, as soon as the decisions have been made, what products/regions each trader will be assigned to.  This is not only for EOL setup, but also for curve files and P&L/Position reporting.  There will be two people, not including myself to run the Central books, so I also need to begin thinking about who will be running each book.  Thanks.

DG

Let me know what you think.  Please add any changes you want.

Also, the letter should be addressed to Jeff Davis in HR for the Analyst Program.

Thank you for agreeing to write a letter of recommending me for the Analyst Program.  I appreciate your time and opinion.  I have included a one page outline to help give you an idea of my accomplishments, job performance, and job development.  This outline is a guideline to help you.

Thank you so much.  It is an awesome letter. I appreciate the time and effort you spent.  One favor...do you think you could ask your admin to put the letter on letterhead?

We decided last night not to go to the Colorado game next week.  I've got two at face if you're interested.  Tough one last weekend.  It sure sucks that OU got that good that fast.  I'm out tomorrow, back on Monday.  See ya.

Great, just as I say my schedule is open, it closes.  I will be in the great state of Oklahoma on Friday, so I will have to cancel.  If I was going, it would be Zydeco all the way!

DG

Well, it looks like the 18th is good for everybody, although I may be a
little late or have to leave early, depending on when we meet.  Noon works
best for me if that is alright with everyone.  I would suggest somewhere
around the Bank One or Shell buildings as the most central to all.
Restaurants around there include Zydeco, Beck's Prime, a Chinese place in 2
Shell, or Luther's.  Let me know your preference.

Anne,
It looks like Crosstimbers had a phys trade with us at NWPL Rox + $.025 and they also had fin trades (Nymex and Basis).  We combined them to essentially make Jan01 a fixed price deal.  It appears the customer is questioning this.  Why they are 8 months after settlement date, I have no idea.  I already spoke with Carole about this and she has the deal tickets but if you have any questions, just ask.

Megan,
Anne should be able to explain this to you.  She runs the West desk now.

DG

Darron:
I saw your name in the audit as changing a price on Cross Timbers deal 434968 for Jan 01.  The note in the terms tab says that the deal was triggered at 8.65, so you changed it from NWPL.Rockies + 0.025 to a fixed 8.65.  I spoke to Cross Timbers and they said they did not trigger this deal.  They said the price should remain at index + 0.025.  Can you confirm this price for me?  I'm showing a $40k adjustment that Cross Timbers does not.

Thanks,
Megan

Diane,

Heartland Energy Group, Inc.
We essentially terminated VU4418.1 and VZ4240.1 on 9/24/01 and paid them $69,200 on 9/26/01 which is in VZ4240.3

Twister Gas Services, LLC
This is more complicated.  We terminated VL2515.1 and Y05186.2 totally.  We partially terminated VN4969.1 (Oct-01 & Nov-01 only), VU4647.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only), and Y05186.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only).  They were terminated on 9/24/01 and they were paid $116,700 on 9/26/01 which is in Y05186.7

I sent a fax to 713-646-2495 of the Termination Agreement they have for a prior deal.  They want one similar to this for these two deals.  Please call if you have any questions.  I appreciate your help.

That sounds very bad.  Did I read that correctly?  It basically says that the series is on the brink of collapse.

Very interesting.  I'd saw where it was settled, but only a small statement.

ALL FARES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE UNTIL TICKETED/PURCHASED

The current exemption is $675,000.  So that means that the first $675,000 of an estate is tax free.  Anything over that is taxed at 55%, but you are allowed deductions such as debts, probate fees, funeral expenses, and any state estate or inheritance taxes.  So the effective rate will be a little lower.  The increase to $1 million will not take effect until 2006.  This is very basic information, estate planning should be handled by a professional to minimize the tax liability.  Obviously, if the estate is not worth much money, then no taxes will be owed.  I'm sure these professionals are highly compensated because they have the ability to save millions of dollars to some of their clients.

Chris loves it when you are at his games.  He was pretty proud of his play at second base.

Hello Son,
 
Glad to have spent some time with you and yours last night.  I love to  see how you interact with your kids. Can you find out for me what is the current  max for no tax on inherited estate?  It used to be $600,000 or so...but I  don't it is increasing year by year to $1million.  Have no idea where to  find this.  Thanks .MOM

Maybe you should stump for president of the series.  Actually, that would be a great job.  You couldn't do much worse, it seems.

DG

I've been warning them for years (the BOZO!!! management) to get their act together.  But who am I?  I'm just a stupid lowly fan who knows nothing in their eyes.....

That sounds very bad.  Did I read that correctly?  It basically says that the series is on the brink of collapse.

DG

Very interesting.  I'd saw where it was settled, but only a small statement.

If you think that is interesting, then check this one out :

Oh my God! How worried should I be? There are 11 letters in the name
"David Pawson!" I'm going into hiding NOW. See you in a few weeks.
Wait a sec ... just realized "YOU CAN'T HIDE" also has 11 letters! What
am I gonna do? Help me!!! The terrorists are after me! ME! I can't
believe it! Oh crap, there must be someplace on the planet Earth I could
hide! But no ... PLANET EARTH" has 11 letters, too!  Maybe Nostradamus can
help me. But dare I trust him? There are 11 letters in "NOSTRADAMUS." I
know, the Red Cross can help. No they can't... 11 letters in "THE RED
CROSS," can't trust them. I would rely on self defense, but "SELF DEFENSE"
has 11 letters in it, too! Can someone help?  Anyone? If so, send me email.
No, don't... "SEND ME EMAIL" has 11 letters....

Will this never end? I'm going insane! "GOING INSANE???" Eleven letters!!
Nooooooooooo!!!!!! I guess I'll die alone, even though "I'LL DIE ALONE" has
11 letters.....  Oh my God, I just realized that America is doomed! Our
Independence Day is July 4th ... 7/4 ... 7+4_!

      PS. "IT'S BULLSHIT" has 11 letters also.

I have to leave the office early for a trip with Bryant and won't be back until Monday.

DG

 

Please forward this invite to the Risk Estate Team. Thanks.

I was out of the office Thurs & Fri.  For Twister, the payment we made on 9/26 ($116,700) corresponds to all five (three partial and two full) terminations.

DG

Darren,

Twister - just want to confirm with you...the one payment for this...does that payment correspond to the three partial terminations, or all five (three partial plus two full) ?

Looks like this was made more difficult than it needed to be.  The customer wanted a termination letter and because of this we need to kill these deals.  I should have just killed the deals in the first place.  Sorry for the extra work.

DG

These deals have unwind legs, I am pulling the tickets to send you the corresponding deal #'s.  The unwinds were done this way per the central orig group.  I am faxing you our copies as soon as we get them.  
Bruce

 Hi Bruce/Edward - 

I am preparing the Termination for the Twister deal below.  Can you kill or zero out (whichever is applicable to the particular deal) the effected deals in TAGG, and also put a comment on the annuity leg to reflect which deals that payment references?  

VL2515.1 should be killed
Y05186.2 should be killed

VN4969.1 partially terminated (Oct 01- Nov 01 only)
VU4647.1 partially terminated (Oct 01 - Dec 01 only)
Y05186.1 partially terminated (Oct 01 - Dec 01 only)

And the annuity leg Y05186.7 should have a comment reflecting that this payment is for the termination of these deals.  

Thanks,
Diane

This was sent to me by a friend who also has a  senior at CHS.  It was put
together by Jamie Wax and Paul Taranto and is  truly profound.   Please
take the time to view it and make sure your  sound is on, the music makes
it.

Vicki

Be sure to visit this  sight.  It is very well done.  Some of you know
Jamie Wax  and  others will have heard the name Taranto because Darlene,
who taught Hank and  Mamie and will, hopefully, teach Mak in 5th grade is
Paul's wife.  Paul and  Jamie wrote the musical "Evangeline" (based on the
Acadian story of Evangeline).   The music is from that play.

I have seen several tributes -- but this one is really special.  New photos
of the WTC
disaster - such an unbelievable nightmare.  Take a few minutes to watch
this.  It's worth it.
-- Jarja

A  guy in Baton Rouge -- Mason Wood -- put together this incredible
montage of the images from 9/11/01 that is incredibly poignant and well
presented.  You've got to see it to appreciate it.  It is set to music
written by Jamie Wax and Paul Taranto from the musical "Evangeline".
They didn't realize what a profoundly appropriate backdrop it
would make to express a country's sentiments.  Put it on and turn it
up!  Then send this on.  I did.

Are you still planning to come down?  I need to get a head count because tickets are sometimes tough to come by.  Let me know.

DG

 

Elena,

Yesterday's list of in the money CP's did not change.  We will forward a list of out of the money CP's shortly.  We will also send IT the list so that they can begin moving them to another book.  There are appox 140 CP's so the move will take some time.

DG

Will you please ask this person doing Diane's work if the termination letter was completed?

Thanks.

I just wanted to remind you how much we love you and appreciate everything you do for us.  I hope you have a great day.  Only 6 more to go.  I saw where Sears is laying off over 4,900 salaried jobs.  I hope Jan is unaffected.  This economy really is starting to get me worried.  I love you.

D

I didn't go to Colorado.  My son had a baseball game and I had been out of town over the weekends lately so we sold the tickets.  They did look pretty good, and could have really blown them out if Sims had been just a little more accurate in the second half.  But I'm not complaining.  I think Brown really made a mistake by going with Ivan Williams against OK.  He is just too slow hitting the hole against a defense like that.  I think the next three are locks.  Then it comes down to T+1.  I don't care how average they may be, UT has won exactly 1 game at Kyle since 1983 (8 games).  Texas should be very good next year.  The only problem area I see is the OL.  I just sent an email to Kyle about lunch.  Let's do it.

ENE is a piece of shit.  That's really all there is to say about that.

DG

Did you go to the game this weekend?    UT looked strong after the first
20min.  Hopefully Neb. and Tech can beat OU.  The A&M game looks like it
could be more of a challenge than I had originally thought.    What's going
on at Enron?  I saw where the SEC will be investigating an Enron
partership.  What's your take on the situation there?

Let's go to lunch soon.

I think Phillip is dead serious about trying to start a business.  Enron's stock is down sharply again today.  It's trading at $16.  Remember in March we got out at $71.  My options are now $68 out of the money and it will be at least 3 years before they will approach breakeven.  If I seem depressed lately, that's why.  Anyway, I love you.

I didn't have an exact email address for Kent, so I guessed.  kkopetzy@utilicorp.com  It was just returned undeliverable.  Please forward the info to him.  Thanks.

This is done.

Lucy wanted me to let you know that I will be handling Utilicorp from the gas end.  It is a territorial issue.  I gave John a quote on the Cal 02 strip and am following up with credit because we don't have an ISDA in place with them.  Let me know if I can be of any assistance on your end.  Thanks.

DG

This is excellent!  Get out of my store!

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Carol,
Attached please find our proposal for your inquiry to purchase Nov01 baseload gas on Reliant.  Please call me if you have any questions or concerns.  Thanks.

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

Although both dates will most likely work for me, I would prefer choice # 1:  Nov 13th in the morning.  Thanks.

There are a growing number of things for us to discuss relative to gas
supply for Pleasant Valley Station.  I would like to suggest the following
dates to meet in Houston.

Choice #1:	November 13, a morning meeting

Choice #2:	Novemer 6, a morning meeting

Please let me know (and reply all in your response) if one or both dates
work.

I will put together an agenda of the items for discussion.

Transaction ID 610 Product ID 35729 did not book correctly.  It is a two leg deal.  The first leg is a GD index deal and the price component has the wrong book.  It has AB-PWR-ST-GD and should be FB-CENT2.  The second leg is a F4F deal and it put the wrong value in the price component and basis component.  Previous nights price settle should be in price and $.02 should be in basis.  The deal has $.02 in price and $.00 in basis.

DG

Darron and Brian	

I pushed a few test deals for Canadian products through and need you to review these deals in Tagg and Sitara to verify that they are booking correctly for valuation purposes.  Please let me know if you see any problems (indexes, books, pricing, etc.)  Don't worry about the deal highlighted in pink..I am working on getting this to bridge.

Please reply by e-mail!!!

Now that we know which traders will be moving over, or we should, we need to make a second pass at the EOL product list.  Can you confirm with your desk heads that the list of names we have is correct, and then update the product mappings by tomorrow afternoon?

10/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp. drew down about $3 billion, the bulk of its available bank cred=
it lines, in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liqu=
idity.=20
Enron will use part of the money to offer to redeem about $1.85 billion of =
outstanding commercial paper -- short-term corporate IOUs -- according to a=
 person familiar with the matter, with the remainder providing the energy c=
oncern with a cash cushion. Some observers believe the move is a pre-emptiv=
e step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access =
to bank lines be interrupted. The person also said Enron was talking to its=
 banks about a new, multibillion-dollar credit line.
Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong.=
 But, "when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last =
few days, we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank," s=
aid an Enron spokesman. In a statement, the company's new chief financial o=
fficer, Jeff McMahon, said that by drawing down the bank lines, "we are mak=
ing it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate=
 liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments."=20
The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over=
 the Houston energy-trading concern in the past 10 days. Enron is the natio=
n's largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one-quarter of all e=
lectricity and natural-gas trades. Yesterday, for example, Enron was involv=
ed in about $4 billion of deals through its EnronOnline unit.=20
Since early last week, Enron's share price has plummeted 50%. Last week, it=
 reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder =
equity of $1.2 billion. It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange =
Commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transaction=
s it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer, And=
rew S. Fastow, who was replaced Wednesday.=20
The draw-down of the credit facilities came as one rating agency, Fitch, pu=
t Enron on review for a possible downgrade, while another, Standard & Poor'=
s, changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. Moody's Investor=
s Service already has said it is looking at a possible downgrade of Enron. =
In order to fall below investment grade, Enron's credit rating would have t=
o fall several notches.=20
If that were to happen, however, a host of bad consequences could follow. T=
ogether with the sharp decline in its stock price, a noninvestment-grade ra=
ting would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions=
 of dollars of borrowings. In that event, Enron could be forced to issue mi=
llions of shares of stock to holders of that debt, diluting the value of ex=
isting shares. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enro=
n was down six cents at $16.35.=20
Liquidity is a key issue for Enron, which handles energy-trading volumes mo=
re than triple its next-biggest competitor, American Electric Power Co. Enr=
on's EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform has transacted more than $=
884 billion of trades since it was created in November 1999.=20
The company's wildly successful wholesale unit has been dragged down by und=
erperforming assets elsewhere in the company, chiefly the approximately $6.=
5 billion of international assets such as its Dabhol power project in India=
. Raising cash and retiring debt largely is a timing issue. The cash needs =
of its trading operation are immediate; it takes time to sell assets, parti=
cularly in today's slower economy.=20
The company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies tha=
t have damaged its credibility, particularly in connection with its dealing=
s with Mr. Fastow, the former chief financial officer. Internal documents r=
elated to one of the Fastow partnerships disclose that Enron also did as mu=
ch as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected =
to another company official, who has since left Enron. While Enron disclose=
d its Fastow-related transactions in SEC filings, a computerized search of =
the SEC's database of public filings produced no reference to this other em=
ployee-related entity known as Chewco.=20
Chewco was established in 1997 "with approximately $400 million in capital =
commitments" to buy an interest in Enron assets, according to one of the pa=
rtnerships documents. The document didn't further specify what assets were =
purchased, and it didn't disclose the financial impact of the transactions =
for either Chewco or Enron. Chewco was being run by Michael Kopper, a manag=
ing director in Enron's Global Equity Markets Group, according to the docum=
ent.=20
Enron, which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with em=
ployee-related entities were legal and properly disclosed, didn't have any =
comment regarding its dealings with Chewco.=20
Mr. Kopper, who Enron says left the company this year to focus on helping t=
o run the Fastow-related partnerships, didn't return phone calls. A person =
at his office in Houston yesterday said Mr. Kopper was traveling. In respon=
se to questions about Chewco, an Enron spokesman would say only that "Micha=
el Kopper was never an executive officer of Enron." Mr. Fastow repeatedly h=
as declined interview requests. He severed his relationships with the partn=
erships in July.=20
This statement is an apparent reference to SEC disclosure regulations regar=
ding related-party transactions. Under SEC rule S-K, a company has to repor=
t any transaction that exceeds $60,000 and involves "any director or execut=
ive officer." By contrast, Mr. Fastow, as CFO, would have fallen into that =
category, but Mr. Kopper, as managing director of a business unit, presumab=
ly wouldn't have.=20
However, reporting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Bo=
ard seems to have a broader definition, one that might include Mr. Kopper. =
According to FAS Statement 57, a related-party transaction involves a "mate=
rial" piece of business between the company and a member of management. The=
 statement defines management as directors, top officers, vice presidents i=
n charge of major business units and "other persons who perform similar pol=
icy-making functions. Persons without formal titles may also be members of =
management."

Deals & Deal Makers: Enron Officials Sell Shares Amid Stock-Price Slump
By Theo Francis and Cassell Bryan-Low
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

The Wall Street Journal
C14
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Officials at Enron Corp., whose unusual transactions with its chief financi=
al officer are under regulatory scrutiny, have steadily sold sizable amount=
s of their holdings of company stock as the share price has fallen this yea=
r.=20
Corporate officials had sold 1.8 million shares valued at about $106 millio=
n through July, as the stock fell to less than $45 a share from $83 at the =
start of the year. Since July, the stock has plummeted an additional 63% to=
 $16.35, including a 50% plunge since the beginning of last week.
Kenneth Lay, chief executive of the Houston energy-trading company, cashed =
in shares for $25.7 million so far this year, usually in transactions paire=
d with options exercises. He sold 429,614 shares, leaving him with some 2.8=
 million shares as of July, the latest data available on his sales, accordi=
ng to Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics.=20
The dollar amount for his 2001 sales is approaching the total for all Mr. L=
ay's sales of Enron shares for 2000, which reached $30.7 million. In 1999, =
he sold shares for a total of $26 million.=20
In Houston, an Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on the figures, saying=
 the company doesn't keep a running tally of stockholdings by corporate off=
icials. Enron also wouldn't comment on the number of options held by compan=
y insiders and called the sales "a personal decision." Many sales by Enron =
insiders were concurrent with options exercises or sales followed soon afte=
r option exercises.=20
Strong selling by company officers and directors amid share-price declines =
should raise red flags for investors, says Jonathan Moreland, research dire=
ctor of InsiderInsights.com, who uses insider-trading data to zero in on in=
vestment ideas.=20
Among other insiders selling during the year, Kenneth Rice, former chairman=
 and CEO of Enron's broadband unit, sold shares for $23.7 million. Mr. Rice=
 has sold 456,966 shares of the 1.5 million shares he was listed as owning =
in Enron's March proxy filing. Former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skillin=
g -- who resigned in August -- sold 160,000 shares for $9.8 million during =
the year. In March, Mr. Skilling owned 1.9 million shares.=20
Messrs. Rice and Skilling couldn't be reached to comment.=20
Overall, Enron's insiders were busier selling shares last year, when they s=
old 5.8 million shares for about $449 million. During 1999, insiders sold 3=
.4 million shares for $123.1 million.=20
Since December 1999, only one Enron executive has reported buying company s=
hares. The buyer was Andrew Fastow, who was ousted during the week as Enron=
's chief financial officer after the company disclosed it was under a Secur=
ities and Exchange Commission investigation into financial ties between the=
 company and Mr. Fastow.=20
Mr. Fastow reported purchasing 10,000 Enron shares in August at $36.98 each=
, or a total of $369,800. Today, those shares are valued at $163,500, based=
 on Enron's stock price of $16.35 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composi=
te trading. After the purchase, Mr. Fastow owned 110,586 shares, Thomson Fi=
nancial/Lancer Analytics says.=20
Enron said Mr. Fastow wasn't available to comment.=20
On Monday, a New York law firm filed suit in U.S. District Court in Houston=
, alleging that Enron misrepresented its performance by failing to disclose=
 problems with its broadband division and failing to properly write down th=
e value of investments in limited partnerships managed by Mr. Fastow. The s=
uit, which seeks class-action status, also says Enron insiders sold $73 mil=
lion of their own Enron holdings during parts of 2000 and 2001.

Credit Markets
Enron's Financial Troubles Reverberate to Bonds With Poor Liquidity and Cre=
dit-Rating Concerns

NEW YORK -- Enron Corp.'s bonds have held up better than its battered stock=
 amid escalating financial woes at the energy-trading powerhouse.=20
Not for long, some bond traders say.
In trading yesterday, the Houston company's five-year bond, a $250 million =
issue due in July 2006 carrying a coupon of 6.4%, was quoted at 82 cents on=
 the dollar, down from a bid of 88 late Wednesday, and representing a 16% d=
rop during the past two weeks.=20
That is far less than the 50% decline in Enron's stock price since the Oct.=
 16 disclosure of a $1.01 billion charge linked to soured investments, resu=
lting in a $618 million third-quarter loss. But the fall in the bond's pric=
e translates to a yield of 7.7 percentage points above bellwether U.S. gove=
rnment bonds, which is a widening from about three percentage points two we=
eks ago. Although Enron still is an investment-grade credit, that kind of "=
spread" is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of singl=
e B or lower.=20
Enron sought to assure the markets that its finances were sound, disclosing=
 late yesterday that it drew down more than $1 billion on its bank credit l=
ines to shore up its finances. Yet even as Enron was tapping its lifeline, =
investors were finding it difficult to trade big blocks of Enron bonds. Yes=
terday's 82 bid, for instance, was for a block of less than $2 million in b=
onds, a small percentage of a typical trade.=20
Fueling the uncertainty surrounding Enron were fears that credit-rating con=
cerns will lower ratings on Enron debt after it recently conceded a slew of=
 troubles, including losses, a Securities and Exchange Commission investiga=
tion, and the sudden resignation of its chief financial officer.=20
"Even at these levels, there's very little buying interest," said Harold Ri=
vkin, a principal at distressed-debt trader H. Rivkin & Co. in Princeton, N=
.J.=20
In one sign of the ripple effects, the price investors pay to protect thems=
elves from losses on Enron debt was surging. The cost of a "default swap" -=
- in which an investor pays another investor to take a chunk of debt at fac=
e value in the event of default -- rose to 10% of the size of the credit be=
ing insured. That was up from 8% a day earlier, and more than holders of Lu=
cent Technologies Inc. debt had to pay at the height of that technology com=
pany's troubles earlier during the year.=20
Even with its woes, Enron remains an investment-grade company. Most credit-=
rating agencies rate Enron's senior unsecured debt at several notches above=
 the noninvestment-grade level.=20
Yet Fitch said yesterday it put Enron's credit rating on watch for a possib=
le downgrade, following a similar move by Moody's Investors Service last we=
ek. (Standard & Poor's, a division of McGraw Hill Cos., stopped short of pu=
tting the company on its Creditwatch list, opting instead to revise its lon=
g-term ratings outlook to "negative," citing concerns about the company's f=
inancial flexibility.)=20
Meanwhile, the weak bond prices are a sign that the markets are bracing for=
 the worst. "These are investment-grade bonds that are migrating toward dis=
tressed levels," said Glenn Reynolds, an analyst at Credit Sights Inc., an =
independent fixed-income research firm in New York. "They aren't distressed=
 yet, but they are headed in that direction."=20
If Enron's credit ratings fall, it would have implications far beyond the c=
ompany's ability to raise money. For an energy trader, a credit downgrade s=
ends a signal to other participants in crucial markets about its ability to=
 make good on its commitments.=20
Enron makes markets in a variety of commodities. Though it is best known fo=
r trading electricity and natural gas, the company also is a huge force in =
the markets for other commodities such as lumber, metals, bandwidth capacit=
y and steel. As a market maker matching buyers and sellers, Enron handles a=
bout a quarter of all the trading in the nation's energy and gas markets.=
=20
Enron's credit-worthiness is hugely important. The better its credit rating=
, the cheaper it can hedge, or offset, its positions in all these commoditi=
es markets through derivatives and pass on savings to customers. Without th=
at credit rating, the cost of this high-margin, high-volume business starts=
 to rise. A derivative is an instrument whose value is linked to, or derive=
d from, that of an underlying security or asset, such as a stock, bond or c=
ommodity.=20
"Even if the company does retain its investment-grade rating, the perceptio=
n that this might be at risk will start to affect their core businesses," s=

Heard on the Street
Most Analysts Remain Plugged In to Enron
By Susanne Craig and Jonathan Weil
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

10/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron: Rarely have so many analysts liked a stock they concede they know so=
 little about.=20
In recent years, Wall Street researchers have been overwhelmingly -- critic=
s would say blindly -- enthusiastic about Enron, even as they acknowledge n=
ot always understanding the complex financial transactions that accounted f=
or its soaring profits. Now, Enron is reporting steep losses from some of i=
ts most complicated transactions, which many on Wall Street still can't fig=
ure out.
In a research note Wednesday, Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer concede=
d that scant corporate disclosure at the Houston energy trader makes it dif=
ficult to value the company. The company's "lack of disclosure and transpar=
ency," he says, is "a longstanding Enron hallmark."=20
So is this a stock to avoid, in his view? Hardly. Goldman on Wednesday did =
bump Enron off its "U.S. Select List," which consists of a few dozen top st=
ock picks -- but Mr. Fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firm's la=
rger but prestigious "Recommended List" of 200 or so favored stocks, where =
it has been since he joined Goldman in 1993.=20
"Just because I can't be specific in being able to create a simple model . =
. . doesn't mean that you write off that industry and say `I can't analyze =
it' or `I can't figure it out,' " says Mr. Fleischer, who owns an undisclos=
ed number of Enron shares. "If that were the case, there would be an awful =
lot of industries we couldn't follow."=20
Enron's shares have dropped about 50% since last week.=20
"Every sell-side analyst we spoke to early in 2001 admitted that this was a=
 black box," says Jim Chanos, principal of Kynikos Associates in New York, =
who has been selling Enron stock short -- trading it with an eye to profiti=
ng from its fall -- throughout this year. "It was really a trust-me story, =
when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that l=
evel of trust."=20
True, no stock picker is immune from bad calls. And Wall Street analysts lo=
ng have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias, particularly=
 on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investment-banking deals to be had.=
=20
But Enron stands apart, precisely because so many of the analysts still rec=
ommending the stock have acknowledged that the company's disclosure practic=
es are lacking. Which raises the question: How can an analyst recommend tha=
t others purchase a stock when key information about the company's operatio=
ns is so often either unavailable or indecipherable?=20
Concerns about the way that Enron runs its business aren't new. Many of the=
 issues now plaguing Enron's stock were first raised more than a year ago b=
y bearish hedge-fund managers and independent accounting experts. Yet time =
and again, Wall Street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the linger=
ing questions about the company's various partnership transactions.=20
Besides those partnerships, Enron also has been dogged by concerns about th=
e secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings.=
=20
Through it all, most analysts have stuck by this onetime stock-market darli=
ng, publicly dismissing questions about the firm's accounting practices and=
 level of disclosure. As of yesterday, of the 17 analysts who following the=
 stock, 10 had a "strong buy" or equivalent rating on the stock, according =
to Thomson Financial/First Call. Five others rated the stock a "buy," thoug=
h not strongly.=20
Only Prudential Securities, which downgraded the stock this week, has a "se=
ll" rating on Enron.=20
The bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most high-profile exampl=
es of Wall Street taking a glass half-full stance, despite what in retrospe=
ct seems to be ample warning that a less-enthusiastic approach was warrante=
d.=20
Over the past year in the wake of the Nasdaq Composite Index's general coll=
apse, analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence -- part=
icularly those who, like Goldman's Mr. Fleischer, own shares in the compani=
es they cover. Regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromis=
ed themselves to help their firms land lucrative investment-banking fees an=
d other revenue.=20
Enron has spread the wealth across many Wall Street firms. For instance, fo=
r one $865 million equity offering in 1999 led by `Credit Suisse First Bost=
on, Enron retained seven co-managers, including Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette=
, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch.=20
"Enron is a big company, and I don't think you're going to find a firm that=
 hasn't been involved," says Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Curt Launer=
, who still rates the stock a "strong buy" with a $40 price target. "They p=
ay a lot of investment-banking fees to Wall Street."=20
He adds, "We do our analysis every day based on the information we have. Ar=
e we here strictly to defend companies? That's ludicrous. We're here to pro=
vide information to investors. . . . Yes, I have the wrong recommendation o=
n the stock. I don't think my analysis has been as wrong as the stock has p=
erformed."=20
Mr. Fleischer, whose firm also has served as an investment banker to Enron,=
 calls his holding "a meaningful investment" that is "not small." But he di=
sputes any suggestion that his objectivity is compromised. Mr. Fleischer sa=
ys his clients "are happy to know" he has a stake in Enron, because it show=
s he puts his money where his mouth is.=20
In his research note Wednesday, Mr. Fleischer called for complete disclosur=
es of Enron's off-balance sheet partnerships. Despite the resulting difficu=
lty he acknowledged facing in developing financial models for the company, =
he wrote that he and many other investors historically "have given Enron th=
e benefit of doubt because of its strong growth in earnings" and position a=
s an industry leader.=20
"There's not information to really model this and be able to predict accura=
tely where revenues are going to come from and where they're going to make =
their money, but every quarter they do," he says. "It's hard to get inside =
to know all the transactions, but they do deliver."=20
CSFB's Mr. Launer also has been a longtime defender of the company, occasio=
nally issuing research reports to rebut critical stories about Enron in the=
 financial press. On Monday, he wrote that he expects questions about Enron=
's partnerships and accounting disclosures to continue, but that he remains=
 "confident in the businesses and operating growth prospects for [Enron] an=
d an ultimate recovery in the share price."=20
"I know I'm wrong on the stock," Mr. Launer says. But he says that at these=
 prices, he isn't ready to throw in the towel because he figures that even =
in a worst-case scenario -- under which he envisions Enron having to issue =
as much as $2 billion worth of shares, diluting current holders -- the stoc=
k doesn't have much further to fall.=20
Clearly, Messrs. Launer and Flesicher aren't alone. "Even in relative terms=
, analysts remain very bullish on this stock," says Chuck Hill, director of=
 research at Thomson Financial/First Call. The average rating for a stock o=
n Wall Street is 2.2, or slightly shy of a "buy" rating. Enron scores a 1.6=
. "This may turn into a classic case of locking the barn door after the bad=
 news is out," Mr. Hill says.=20
In downgrading the stock this week, Prudential analyst Carol Coale bumped i=
t to "sell" from "buy," with a brief stop at "hold." While she is the only =
analyst to recommend investors sell the stock, she openly concedes her rece=
nt downgrades come "too little, too late."=20
Ms. Coale says Enron has been difficult to cover for years. She says the co=
mpany's disclosure practices fall far short of ideal, and senior executives=
 are often evasive, even when presented with direct questions. For instance=
, she says three weeks ago she asked Enron management if the company was un=
der investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. They said "no,=
" she says.=20
In light of the company's acknowledgment this week of an SEC "inquiry," she=
 asked Enron about the previous denial. "They told me it is an inquiry, not=
 an investigation," she says. An Enron spokeswoman says the company learned=
 of the SEC's inquiry only last Wednesday.

Enron Draws Down $3 Bln in Credit to Boost Investor Confidence

Enron Draws Down $3 Bln in Credit to Boost Investor Confidence

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., whose stock has
fallen on concern about the largest energy trader's transactions
with affiliates, drew down $3 billion in credit to restore
confidence in its financial strength.

     The Houston-based company will use about $2.2 billion to pay
off commercial paper obligations and keep the rest as cash,
spokesman Mark Palmer said.

     ``Nothing instils confidence like cash,'' he said.

     Enron's shares have dropped 52 percent in the past 10 days as
investors worry that the company's credit rating will be cut after
$1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from failed investments.
Enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading
partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions.

     Investors say they are worried about $3.3 billion in
liabilities from affiliates formed to buy and sell Enron assets.
Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on Wednesday
amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into
partnerships he ran that cost the company $35 million.

     Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets group, was
named CFO in a bid to restore investor confidence, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said in a statement.

     Enron shares fell 6 cents to $16.35 yesterday.

Enron Liked By Analysts Despite Complicated Dealings, WSJ Says
2001-10-26 06:12 (New York)

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is liked by many
Wall Street analysts despite lingering questions about the power
trading company's complicated partnership transactions and the
techniques used to record earnings, the Wall Street Journal
reported in its ``Heard on the Street'' column.

     Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst David Fleischer, who owns an
undisclosed number of Enron shares, said that even though
inadequate corporate disclosure makes it difficult to value the
company, that doesn't mean he will write off the industry or not
analyze Enron.

     Of the 17 analysts who follow the stock, 10 had a ``strong
buy'' or equivalent rating, according to Thomson Financial/First
Call, the paper said. Five rated it ``buy'' and one had a ``sell''
on Enron.

     Most analysts have stuck by the company, publicly dismissing
questions about Enron's accounting practices and level of
disclosure, the Journal said.

     The Securities and Exchange Commission is inquiring about
partnerships run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.

Enron Draws Down $3 Billion From Its Credit Lines, WSJ Reports
2001-10-26 00:28 (New York)

     New York, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. drew down about
$3 billion of its available credit, the bulk of its bank credit
lines, to restore confidence in the financial strength of the
company, the Wall Street Journal reported.

     The energy trading company, whose shares have fallen 52
percent since Oct. 16, will use part of the money to redeem about
$1.85 billion short-term commercial debt, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter.

     Enron is talking to banks about a new, multi-billion line of
credit, the paper reported, citing the unidentified person. The
steps are seen as an effort by the energy trader to ensure that it
has adequate liquidity in case its access to bank credit is
disrupted, the paper said.

     Enron said in a statement distributed by PR Newswire that it
drew on its credit lines to provide more than $1 billion in cash
liquidity. The steps come a day after Chief Financial Officer
Andrew Fastow resigned amid a Securities and Exchange Commission
probe of partnerships he ran.

Corporate US on track for bailout

Battered corporate America will receive an immediate Dollars 25bn (pounds 1=
8bn) tax rebate under a Dollars 100bn eocnomic stimulation package just app=
roved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.=20
The controversial package, worth an estimated Dollars 212bn over three year=
s, includes Dollars 70bn for companies next year alone. It was approved by =
the House late on Wednesday by 216 votes to 214, but faces significant amen=
dment in the Senate, which is now under Democrat control.
It has reopened a wide ideological rift between Republicans, who favour cor=
porate and individual tax cuts to reboot an economy mired in recession, and=
 Democrats - who, in a reprise of the Roosevelt "new deal", prefer to see i=
ncreased public spending on unemployment and infrastructure projects.=20
Liberal lobby groups such as the Citizens for Tax Justice and the Center on=
 Budget and Policy Priorities claim the bill would hand back Dollars 6.3bn =
to the 14 biggest corporations - which, they say, are renowned for paying l=
ittle or no tax.=20
The most hotly contested measure is the repeal of the corporate alternative=
 minimum tax, or AMT, introduced in 1986 to make sure firms could not avoid=
 all tax payments. This, strongly supported by President Bush, would be mad=
e retroactive so that all AMT payments would be refunded.=20
The lobby groups and the non-partisan Congressional Research Service calcul=
ate that this would give a Dollars 1.4bn boost to computer group IBM alone,=
 while General Motors would get back Dollars 833m and General Electric Doll=
ars 671m.=20
Others to benefit include TXU, the Texas-based utility that is the US's thi=
rd largest energy supplier, which would would be given Dollars 608m. United=
 Airlines, the US's second largest carrier - which is warning of bankruptcy=
 - would receive Dollars 371m, and Enron, the energy trading group forced t=
o sack its finance director this week, would be given Dollars 254m.=20
Democrat leaders in the Senate are determined to erase this measure and dis=
like other proposals to boost firms, which include a 30% tax break for capi=
tal investment over three years worth Dollars 39.3bn this year alone. They =
say these amount to a "giant corporate giveaway".=20
Mr Bush and other Republican leaders argue these fiscal concessions would h=
elp companies making hundreds of thousands redundant avoid further lay-offs=
 and invest more, prompting an economic recovery that, at best, is likely t=
o start in the new year.=20
"Businesses are America's employers. They're the hardware store, the diner =
down the street, the gas station on the corner. They're not the enemy of wo=
rking families," the author of the plan, Representative Bill Thomas of Cali=
fornia, said.=20
Democrats are especially incensed with the alleged paucity of the package's=
 provisions for the growing numbers of jobless, arguing that much of the Do=

ates.=20

Harvey Pitt's S.E.C.: From Guard Dog to Friendly Puppy?
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/26/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

CAN the new, friendlier Securities and Exchange Commission enforce the laws=
 and assure investors that corporate financial reports are trustworthy?=20
Harvey L. Pitt, the new S.E.C. chairman, set out this week to show that he =
is not like his predecessor, Arthur Levitt. In a speech to the American Ins=
titute of Certified Public Accountants -- an organization whose senior lead=
ership led a bitter and ultimately unsuccessful fight against Mr. Levitt's =
reform efforts -- Mr. Pitt praised his listeners and took a few swipes at h=
is predecessor.=20
From now on, he promised, ''the commission will make sound decisions, in a =
respectful, affirmative way, not in a demeaning, demanding or demonizing wa=
y.'' He spoke favorably of ''pro forma'' earnings reports, in ways that no =
doubt heartened accountants who have worked so hard to find ways to make ev=
en the worst profit figures look pretty. There was no mention of Mr. Levitt=
's concerns about improper management of earnings.
On the heels of Mr. Pitt's speech, the S.E.C. used a minor enforcement acti=
on to herald a policy of not cracking down on companies that come forward t=
o report their own errors. The decision itself was reasonable, although one=
 could wonder if top management did something wrong in failing to detect a =
fraud that went on for years. But the way the S.E.C. trumpeted it raised qu=
estions about whether the agency is turning into a friendly puppy rather th=
an a guard dog. ''Is this amnesty for financial fraud?'' Jane Adams, the ac=
counting analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston and a former S.E.C. staff me=
mber, asked in a report to clients. She was not sure of the answer.=20
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Pitt dismissed such worries. ''No one is goi=
ng to get away with anything,'' he said. ''What we are trying to do is crea=
te an environment where people feel comfortable'' and can talk to the S.E.C=
. ''without feeling we are looking for a big splash.''=20
A major embarrassment for accountants is having the S.E.C. force a client t=
o restate its numbers. Mr. Pitt and his chief accountant, Robert Herdman, a=
re sending signals that fewer such demands will be made. ''I am very much i=
n favor of a vigorous enforcement program,'' Mr. Pitt said in the interview=
, ''but I am not in favor of having investors barraged by conflicting state=
ments and restatements.''=20
Mr. Pitt talks of companies ''getting it right the first time,'' which woul=
d certainly be nice. But there is a risk that companies will become more ag=
gressive in their accounting, figuring there will be no real penalty, like =
a restatement, if they are caught. That would make life harder for auditors=
 who try to resist misleading accounting.=20
In trying to sound comforting to the accountants' group -- an organization =
that, as he noted, he had represented as a lawyer for two decades -- Mr. Pi=
tt has done little to reassure investors of his independence.=20
The proof, of course, will come in the performance. Fortunately, the mess a=
t Enron gives the S.E.C. a golden opportunity to counter the puppy image. I=
t will take time for the commission to determine if the company's accountin=
g was proper. But there need be no delay in forcing Enron to clearly explai=
n -- rather than obfuscate as it has so far -- the strange deals it made wi=
th partnerships run by the executive just ousted as chief financial officer=
.=20
''This could,'' a former S.E.C. staff member said, ''focus the issue on whe=
ther companies can make completely correct but totally misleading disclosur=
es.'' And it would indicate that this watchdog still has a bite.

The Five Dumbest Things on Wall Street This Week
By K.C. Swanson <mailto:kcswanson@thestreet.com>
Staff Reporter

URL: <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/dumbest/10003035.html>
TheStreet.com
1. United Airlines Just a Little Too Honest
Rule No. 1 in CEO school: Never say that your company may soon collapse.=20
Seems kind of obvious, but that rule was flouted by United Airlines chief J=
ames Goodwin, who warned in a letter to employees that the company "will pe=
rish" next year unless it can stanch its tremendous losses, which have wors=
ened since the terrorist attacks. "Today, we are literally hemorrhaging mon=
ey," he wrote.=20
In raising concerns about the financial viability of United, a unit of UAL =
(UAL:NYSE - news - commentary) , Goodwin only put into words what outsiders=
 have speculated about. Since Sept. 11, the airline has laid off about 20,0=
00 of its 100,000 employees and cut flights by as much as 25%. It's expecte=
d to announce massive losses when it reports third-quarter earnings.=20
But in response to the disclosure, Goodwin has been roundly attacked. Feeli=
ng that he had been all too honest, investors have knocked an additional 24=
% off the stock's value. The shares are down 54% since Sept 11. Meanwhile, =
UAL union leaders reportedly say Goodwin has exaggerated company difficulti=
es to gain bargaining leverage in union negotiations. The leaders of one un=
ion have petitioned the company's board of directors to have him sacked.=20
Bottom line: CEOs may get pilloried when they try to dodge the truth, but s=
ometimes it doesn't pay to be too candid about worst-case scenarios, either=
. Especially when that scenario is the company's own demise.=20
2. Forget the Victory Gardens; Let's Have a Comfortable War=20
Sure, we're at war with a band of cave-dwelling outlaws hell bent on our an=
nihilation. But would all freedom-loving Americans please go out and buy so=
me DVD players? Maybe even a nice new car?=20
That was basically the message from the Treasury Department, on news that C=
ongress had voted for the creation of war bonds to finance antiterrorism ef=
forts and rebuilding following the attacks. Officials at Treasury applauded=
 the sentiment, then politely suggested it would be even better for the eco=
nomy if Americans just went to stores and bought stuff. "The economy is per=
haps our greatest asset as we move forward in these efforts to fight the wa=
r on global terrorists," says Betsy Holahan, a department spokesperson. "Wa=
r bonds are an additional way for Americans to show their patriotism."=20
For the record, we don't think an issue of war bonds would be dumb, just su=
perfluous. After all, nothing's stopped Americans from buying generic savin=
gs bonds -- or better yet, Treasuries -- all of which finance spending by t=
he federal government.=20
In the meantime, it's a little dislocating to hear politicians talk up war =
bonds -- which most people associate with hardship and sacrifice -- at the =
same time top economic gurus are practically begging people to shop. War bo=
nds notwithstanding, we're a long way off from the era of ration books.=20
3. Enron Again
Last week, we noted the extent of alarm about Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - co=
mmentary) revelation that its shareholder equity had dropped $1.2 billion, =
following some unusual and possibly inappropriate high-level transactions. =
Following that disclosure, besieged CFO Andrew Fastow has finally left the =
company on what's delicately termed a "leave of absence."=20
In July, Fastow exited a limited partnership, from which he had reportedly =
reaped large profits, after shareholders and analysts objected to his invol=
vement. Concerns about those dealings and others had increased in the wake =
of the disclosure about the charge to equity until even management acknowle=
dged Fastow would have to go as a prerequisite to restoring investor confid=
ence.=20
But that won't be an easy task, given the resentment about Enron's disincli=
nation to explain its problems. One analyst called Fastow's departure "unse=
ttling," noting that management had given the CFO its endorsement only the =
day before. Sounding a note of exasperation, analysts at J.P. Morgan Chase,=
 Banc of America Securities and Prudential all downgraded the stock. And th=
ere could be more trouble to come: The Securities and Exchange Commission h=
as issued Enron a letter of inquiry related to some of its transactions.=20
4. Gold Diggers=20
It's understandable that investors felt panicky in September. Unfortunately=
, some reacted by shoving their hard-earned money into gold funds. Accordin=
g to Financial Research Corp., which tracks fund flows, the specialty preci=
ous-metals category was the best-selling equity category during September, =
with net inflows of $101 million.=20
Granted, that's not a huge sum in the mutual fund world. By comparison, dur=
ing the same month, large growth funds saw net redemptions of $7.4 billion.=
 But the fact that so many people are jumping into precious metals is notew=
orthy, given that gold funds have performed so badly for so long.=20
Sure, under the bizarre circumstances of late, they've enjoyed somewhat of =
a pop. According to Morningstar, the average precious-metals fund is up 10.=
08% year to date. But over the past five years, the same category lost an e=
mbarrassing 14.68%. By comparison, even large-cap growth funds -- everybody=
's favorite whipping boy -- managed to post a positive return. In the same =
period, they were up 7.13%.=20
Moreover, circumstances that would seem to be the most favorable in decades=
 -- a combination of attacks on the U.S. government and war -- still don't =
seem to have boosted gold prices significantly. Despite an initial surge in=
 prices after the terrorist attacks, they're again approaching their pre-Se=
pt. 11 levels. It's too early to say, but it's likely the gold bugs will co=
nfront disappointment once again.=20
5. Amazon Amazes Once Again
Amazon (AMZN:Nasdaq - news - commentary) still maintains it will become pro=
fitable by the fourth quarter. Well, at least it will post a pro forma oper=
ating profit.=20
OK, so maybe that wouldn't include Amazon's service on $2.17 billion in lon=
g-term debt or extraordinary charges. In fact, a pro forma operating profit=
 is basically just an accounting concept that would lend a fuzzy, meaningle=
ss aura of minor triumph. The company still hasn't said when it will turn a=
n economic profit.=20
For that matter, even the fourth-quarter prediction is iffy. After announci=
ng the company expected to turn the pro forma operating profit, CFO Warren =
Jenson added the humble qualifier, "There are no guarantees." Amazon simult=
aneously lowered its forecast for fourth-quarter revenue, predicting that s=
ales would be somewhere between flat and up by 10% compared with a year ago=
.=20
Third-quarter trends weren't encouraging. Though sales overall were up slig=
htly in the third quarter from a year ago, revenue from the company's core =
books and music business actually fell 12%. At least the company has made p=
rogress in cutting costs: A spokesperson says pro forma operating expenses =
have decreased by 20% over the past year.=20
Incidentally, in the wake of Amazon's earnings report, two analysts made th=
e belated decision to cut their ratings on the stock, which has fallen 93% =
from its high back in December 1999. Merrill Lynch analyst Henry Blodget an=
d SG Cowen analyst Scott Reamer downgraded the stock to "neutral" from prev=
ious buy ratings. "We thought there might be upside to our estimates," note=
d Blodget. "There wasn't."=20

NEW YORK, Oct. 25 -- Selected buying of technology and energy shares pulled=
 the stock market higher today, reversing a morning slide triggered by a pa=
ir of grim economic reports.=20
Shares of semiconductor makers and equipment manufacturers did particularly=
 well, as did energy traders, led by a surprisingly strong performance from=
 Williams Cos., a Tulsa-based energy firm that had an 83 percent jump in th=
ird-quarter net earnings.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed rose at 9448.78, up 103.16, reversi=
ng an earlier deficit of 167 points. The Nasdaq composite index rose 36.29,=
 to 1767.83, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index was rose 12.79, to 1097.99=
.=20
Earlier, a pair of dismal economic reports had compounded worries about the=
 fallout from last month's terrorist attacks to send stocks lower. As in re=
cent sessions, however, investors absorbed the bad news and focused on good=
 news regarding individual companies.=20
Williams Cos. surpassed analysts' estimates for the third quarter and raise=
d its forecasts for full-year earnings for 2001 and 2002. Investors rewarde=
d the company by driving its shares up $1.42, to $27.32, bringing several o=
ther parts of the energy sector along with it.=20
Even the shares of Enron rose, a day after the embattled company dismissed =
its chief financial officer and replaced him with an another executive from=
 within the company. Enron rose 28 cents, to $16.69.=20
Semiconductor shares also rebounded, led by industry bellwether Intel, up 4=
4 cents at $25.92, and Applied Materials, up $1.35 at 36.69. Leading data-s=
torage maker EMC rose $1.06, to $13.54.=20
Traders said the Senate's passage this afternoon of an anti-terrorism measu=
re also helped lift investor sentiment. Late Wednesday, the House passed a =
$100 billion economic stimulus package to combat the effects of the terrori=
st attacks on the economy.=20
A surprisingly large drop in orders for durable goods had weighed heavily o=
n the market in the morning, as did poor earnings results from American Int=
ernational Group and WorldCom.=20
The Commerce Department reported orders plunged in September for the fourth=
 consecutive month. The 8.5 percent decline was far worse than the 1.3 perc=
ent dip many analysts had forecast.=20
The Labor Department also reported that the number of newly laid-off Americ=
ans filing for unemployment benefits rose by 8,000 last week, to 504,000, t=
he second-highest figure in nearly a decade and a level that is generally a=
ssociated with recessions.=20
Other Indicators=20
* The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 5.88, to 562.96; the Ame=
rican Stock Exchange index rose 5.10, to 828.67; and the Russell index of 2=

* Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by 9 to 7 on the NYSE, where =
trading volume rose to 1.38 billion shares, from 1.35 billion on Wednesday.=
 On the Nasdaq, advancers outnumbered decliners by more than 3 to 2 and vol=
ume totaled 2.2 billion, up from 1.84 billion.=20
* The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose $4.38 per $1,000 invested, =
and its yield fell to 4.54 percent, from 4.59 percent late Wednesday.=20
* The dollar rose against the Japanese yen and the euro. In late New York t=
rading, a dollar bought 122.87 yen, up from 122.76 yen late Wednesday, and =
a euro bought 89.25 cents, down from 89.42 cents.=20
* Light, sweet crude oil for December delivery settled at $22.01 a barrel, =
up 32 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.=20
* Gold for current delivery rose to $277.80 a troy ounce, from $275.90 on W=

Enron Taps $3 Billion From Bank Lines in Pre-Emptive Move to Ensure Liquidi=

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Embattled Enron Corp. drew down about $3 billion, the bulk of its available=
 bank credit lines, in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strengt=
h and liquidity, Friday's Wall Street Journal reported.=20
Enron (ENE) will use part of the money to offer to redeem around $1.85 bill=
ion in outstanding commercial paper -- short-term corporate IOUs -- accordi=
ng to a person familiar with the matter, with the remainder used to provide=
 a cash cushion. This person also said that Enron was talking to its banks =
about a new multibillion-dollar credit line. Some observers thought the mov=
es were a pre-emptive step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidit=
y should its access to bank lines be interrupted.
Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong.=
 But "when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last f=
ew days, we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank," sa=
id an Enron spokesman. In a prepared statement, the company's new chief fin=
ancial officer, Jeff McMahon, said that by drawing down the bank lines, "we=
 are making it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than =
adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitme=
nts."=20
The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over=
 the Houston energy-trading firm in the past 10 days. Enron is the nation's=
 largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one-quarter of all elec=
tricity and natural-gas trades. Thursday, for example, Enron was involved i=
n about $4 billion worth of deals through its EnronOnline unit.=20
Since early last week, Enron's share price has plummeted 50%. It has report=
ed a $618 million third-quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity =
of $1.2 billion. It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commiss=
ion is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it di=
d with entities run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow=
, who was replaced Wednesday.=20
The draw-down of the credit facilities came as a major rating agency, Fitch=
, put Enron on review for a possible downgrade while Standard & Poors chang=
ed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. Moody's Investors Servic=
e has already said it is looking at a possible downgrade. In order to fall =
below investment grade, Enron's credit rating would have to fall several no=
tches.=20
If that were to happen, however, a host of bad consequences could follow. T=
ogether with the sharp decline in its stock price, a noninvestment grade ra=
ting would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions=
 of dollars of borrowings. In that event, Enron could be forced to issue mi=
llions of shares of stock to holders of that debt, diluting the value of ex=
isting shares. As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, E=
nron shares were down six cents at $16.35.=20

NEW YORK (AP) - As it grew over the past decade into the country's largest =
natural gas and power marketing company, Enron Corp. became the de facto ba=
rometer of health within the energy trading sector.=20
Wall Street buoyed the stock prices of Enron's competitors based in part on=
 the huge success of the Houston-based company's business model. Now, execu=
tives and industry analysts hope to prevent Enron's internal tumult and fre=
e-falling stock price from undermining investors' confidence in the sector.=
 They say the Houston-based company's problems should be viewed in isolatio=
n and not as a broader indicator of the marketplace.
"The marketplace for natural gas and power trading is as vibrant as it was =
yesterday, a week ago or a month ago," said Jim Donnell, president of Duke =
Energy North America, a division of Duke Energy Corp. that generates and tr=
ades power.=20
That opinion appeared to gain acceptance on Thursday as shares of Dynegy In=
c., El Paso Corp. and Duke Energy Corp. rebounded from losses on Wednesday,=
 when Enron's latest woes appeared to spill over into the stock prices of i=
ts rivals.=20
Enron's stock has fallen about 50 percent in the past week (and nearly 80 p=
ercent since January) and analysts said its recovery is not expected anytim=
e soon.=20
The latest troubles began Oct. 16 when Enron reported third quarter earning=
s, and a longtime concern among Wall Street analysts that executives were n=
ot entirely forthcoming only got worse.=20
First came reports that some of the company's losses stemmed from partnersh=
ips managed by Enron's chief financial officer at the time, Andrew Fastow. =
That raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest and touched off=
 an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20
Then on Wednesday, one day after Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay defended Fastow=
, the company ousted him and said he would take a leave of absence.=20
"They created an environment in which their credibility was put to the test=
 and they didn't come through with flying colors," said Christopher Ellingh=
aus, an analyst at Williams Capital Group in New York.=20
Enron shares have been falling all year for reasons new and old, which have=
 little to do with the company's wholesale energy business, which accounts =
for roughly 80 percent of profits.=20
Analysts insist wholesale energy marketing can be profitable even in the fa=
ce of an economic downturn and falling natural gas and electricity prices.=
=20
"Even though (Enron) shot themselves in the foot, the basic business is sti=
ll sound and not likely to disappear," Ellinghaus said.=20
UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone echoed that sentiment.=20
"The collateral damage to the rest of the space - Dynegy and El Paso - is o=
verdone," Barone said.=20
On Thursday, Williams Companies Inc. of Tulsa, Okla., reported net income o=
f $760 million and Reliant Resources Inc. of Houston reported $133 million =
in profits.=20
"It's business as usual," said Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel.=20
Not for Enron, whose stock price began a steady descent 10 months ago when =
its nascent high-speed Internet unit failed to live up to the hype. The dow=
nward momentum was further propelled by difficulties collecting money from =
power customers in India and the surprise departure in August of then-chief=
 executive Jeff Skilling was considered another bad sign.=20
On Oct. 16, Enron reported a net loss of $638 million in the third quarter,=
 taking a one-time charge of $1.01 billion attributed to investment losses,=
 troubled assets and unit restructurings. Excluding the charge, Enron earne=
d $393 million on $47.6 billion in revenues for the three months ending Sep=
t. 30.=20
Ellinghaus said the stocks of Enron's competitors were brought down Wednesd=
ay because of "dire" speculation that Enron's troubles might be so bad that=
 it could have difficulty paying hundreds of millions of dollars worth of r=
eceivables to companies such as Duke and Dynegy.=20
"All I'm hearing is doomsday type stuff and doomsday is not reality," Ellin=
ghaus said.=20
Enron did not return calls seeking comment Thursday.=20
Donnell of Duke Energy said the Charlotte, N.C.-based company is paying clo=
se attention to the Enron situation and that there has been no indication o=
f receivables not being paid.=20
"They continue to be one of the best functioning companies as it relates to=
 credit," he said. "They've never missed a deadline."

Enron's Credit Outlook Downgraded to Negative by S&P (Update1)

Enron's Credit Outlook Downgraded to Negative by S&P (Update1)

     (Adds analyst comment in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s long-term
credit ratings outlook was changed to negative from stable by
Standard & Poor's after the largest energy trader's shares fell
49 percent in the past week.

     S&P affirmed the Houston-based company's ratings of
``BBB+/A2,'' which are investment grade.

     The ratings company cited lost market capitalization and the
possibility that Enron won't generate enough money from selling
assets outside the main trading business to repay debt. S&P did
say that ``the strategic direction of the company is likely to
become more credit-positive in the wake of recent management
changes.''

     Enron reported $1.01 billion in losses from investments
outside the principal business of trading commodities such as
electricity and natural gas. Chief Financial Officer Andrew
Fastow resigned yesterday as the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission asks for information about related-party transactions
he conducted.

     ``The S&P write up was very positive,'' said Dorothea
Matthews, an analyst at CreditSights Inc., a research firm. ``It
seems that the ratings company went out of its way to tray and
calm things down.''

     Shares of Enron fell 6 cents to $16.35.

Enron's Trading Partners Say It's Business as Usual (Update2)

     (Adds new Enron CFO in 14th paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Concerns Enron Corp. will run
short on cash haven't prevented commodities traders from doing
business with the largest energy broker, customers say.

     The company handles about 25 percent of U.S. power and
natural-gas trading, said John Kilduff, vice president of energy
risk management for Fimat USA. It's also a leader in complex
derivatives that allow others to hedge against the risk of
fluctuating commodities prices.

     Enron's credit rating is on watch for possible downgrade at
Moody's Investors Service, and Standard & Poor's lowered Enron's
long-term credit outlook to negative after $1.01 billion in third-
quarter losses from some soured investments. The company needs
good credit to raise cash every day to keep trading partners from
demanding collateral and to settle transactions.

     So far, there are no signs that Houston-based Enron is
handling less business, Kilduff said.

     ``If they were unable to perform, it would be a major
problem,'' he said. ``It could get like Long-Term Capital if
things really broke down because the numbers are that big.''

     Long-Term Capital Management, a private investment fund for
the wealthy, incurred massive losses making bond trades during the
1998 Russian currency crisis. The fund's portfolio plunged. More
than a dozen banks bailed out the fund at a cost of $3.6 billion
to avoid a collapse.

                         Needs Cash Daily

     Enron trades electricity, natural gas, coal and other
commodities worldwide, as well as complex financial instruments to
hedge against price swings in the goods.

     ``As of now, Enron is active in the markets,'' Kilduff said.
``No one is cutting trading lines that I can see, or demanding
different terms than before.''

     Companies that trade as heavily as Enron require cash every
day to settle positions, said Kilduff, whose company swaps natural
gas and other energy investments with Enron.

     Some days, Fimat will bet that natural-gas prices will fall,
while Enron bets that they will rise. Natural gas usually does one
or the other every day, and someone pays the difference.

     ``The liquidity of your trading partners is a risk factor,''
Kilduff said. ``Someone is paying someone else every day.''

     Enron said on a conference call Tuesday that it has enough
money to operate normally, and can fall back on $3.4 billion in
bank credit lines if necessary. The company is determined to
protect the credit rating, Enron has said.

     ``We aren't even going to entertain worst-case scenarios at
this point,'' said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne.

                        Investor Questions

     Enron, based in Houston, ousted Chief Financial Officer
Andrew Fastow yesterday, two days after the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission began asking questions about partnerships he
ran that invested in company shares. Those trades cost Enron $35
million. Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets unit,
replaced Fastow, who went on leave of absence.

     Enron shares have fallen 49 percent in the past week. They
fell 6 cents to $16.35 today.

     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-
term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above
investment grade. Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's all rate
the company's debt at investment grade.

     The company also faces questions from investors about $3.3
billion in potential liabilities from affiliated companies formed
to buy and sell Enron assets such as power plants.

     The affiliates owe payments to bond investors and plan to
meet them by selling assets. Enron doesn't know if the sale
proceeds will cover the debt. The company would have to make good
on any shortfall.

                            Little Time

     Enron asked Citicorp Inc. on Tuesday to arrange a $750
million loan to ensure access to credit if the company gets shut
out of the money markets.

     Enron had about $1.85 billion of commercial paper, or short-
term unsecured debt, outstanding as of Tuesday, traders said. The
company, which has a $3 billion program, has had difficulty
finding buyers for new commercial paper sales since the SEC
investigation was announced, the traders said.

     Today, Enron offered two-week commercial paper at a 3 percent
yield, 10 to 15 basis points above comparably rated companies.

     ``There appears to be enough liquidity to give them enough
time to get their house in order,'' said Jon Kyle Cartwright,
senior energy credit analyst at Raymond James & Associates.
``There's a point where a credibility crisis becomes a self-
fulfilling prophecy, so they have less time than they think to
pacify the market.''

                           Ripple Effect

     Some investors are concerned that Enron's complex book of
hedges, swaps, options and other derivative contracts involves so
many partners, participants and companies that a failure would
pose a risk to the economy, and force a bailout like Long-Term
Capital Management's.

     ``The talk in the financial markets is that some counter
party to Enron could fail if Enron can't perform,'' said Jeff
Caughron, manager of $400 million in investments for Tinker
Federal Credit Union in Oklahoma City. ``If it goes down, there
could be a big ripple effect.''

     The effect has already spread as investors worry Enron won't
be able to pay bills owed to power producers such as Calpine
Corp., Dynegy Inc., Mirant Corp. and NRG Inc., said Chris
Ellinghaus, an analyst at Williams Capital Group. As a group,
shares of the four have fallen 11 percent in the past week.

     ``Rumors that these companies have receivables with Enron are
fueling a sell-off,'' he said. ``Both traders and companies
selling power to Enron are suffering.''

     All four companies said they're trading with Enron as they
have in the past.

                         Market Maker

     Enron supplies services some customers consider
irreplaceable. The Sacramento Municipal Utilities District hedges
weather risk through Enron, said risk manager Jim Tracy.

     The district entered into an agreement that forces it to pay
Enron if rainfall is abundant and hydroelectric dams can operate
at peak efficiency and capacity; in dry seasons, when the dams
can't operate as well, Enron pays the district.

     ``If Enron's credit went bad, or they folded up, that
agreement wouldn't get picked up by someone else,'' Tracy said.

     Enron also helps many U.S. utilities protect themselves from
electricity and natural gas price fluctuations in the same way it
helps the Sacramento utility district hedge against too little
rainfall. Any impairment on Enron's part to continue doing so
would trickle down to Main Street utilities, Tracy said.

     ``Utilities would start reserving more on their balance
sheets for price swings,'' Tracy said.

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) telecommunications unit will clos=

.=20
Enron Broadband Services executives have quietly begun to inform employees =
overseas and haven't made a public announcement of plans to consolidate Asi=
an and European bandwidth trading operations at the company's Houston headq=
uarters.
"It's a way to structure the business to fit the opportunities that are out=
 there in the market now," Enron Broadband Services spokeswoman Terrie Jame=
s said in response to questions from Dow Jones Newswires.=20
The London office has 20 or fewer employees, James told Dow Jones. The Sing=
apore office has 15 or fewer employees.=20
Americans working in the offices would probably choose to relocate in the U=
.S., James said. She didn't know how many of the employees are U.S. citizen=
s. She didn't know what options might be offered to the non-American employ=
ees.=20
James didn't know how much money Enron might save by closing the offices.=
=20
The decision by Enron, the leading bandwidth market-maker, shows that inter=
national bandwidth markets are having tough times like the U.S. market.=20
Earlier this year, as the U.S. market went sour, Enron executives had said =
that European and Asian telecommunications carriers might be more open to b=

Calpine:No Exposure To Enron; No Calif Pwr Contract Talks

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Calpine Corp. (CPN) has no credit exposure to tradin=
g partner Enron Corp. (ENE), Calpine said Thursday in an earnings conferenc=
e call. And the company hasn't been contacted by the state of California ab=
out renegotiating the billions of dollars in long-term supply contracts the=
 company signed with the state earlier this year.=20
Calpine's diluted net earnings for the third quarter were 88 cents a share =
compared with 48 cents for the same quarter last year. Setting Calpine's co=
nsistent earnings growth aside, Wall Street analysts in Thursday's conferen=
ce call focused their questions on trouble spots in the energy industry, li=
ke Enron, California, and whether the U.S. will have a surplus of electric =
power stations in a few years.
Moody's has put Enron's credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some of=
 the company's debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this=
 week. Trading partners like Calpine have been asked about their exposure t=
o Enron.=20
"We continue to assess the situation, but right now don't have any net expo=
sure to Enron," said Calpine's vice president of corporate risk management,=
 Paul Pasoli. "We continue to trade with them. We will adjust our credit th=
reshold based on how their bonds are trading and their credit rating."=20
When asked if there would be any exposure to Enron if trading were to be ha=
lted immediately, Pasoli said that, in fact, Calpine would owe Enron a litt=
le money.=20
In another energy industry area of concern, Calpine was asked about the sta=
te of California's stated desire to renegotiate tens of billions of dollars=
 of long-term power contracts. Calpine is by far the biggest supplier under=
 those contracts, which on a mark-to-market basis are worth far less now th=
an when California bought this past winter and spring.=20
"Nobody has come to us directly or indirectly with regard to the Calif cont=
racts. In general, we respect our contracts and expect our counterparties t=
o do so as well," said Calpine cheif executive, Peter Cartwright. "If there=
 are any contract renegotiations that can result in a win-win, we would be =
happy to look at that, if California asks. We've done that many times."=20
As for future power prices, Calpine said that it's going forward with its p=
rogram to build a portfolio of 70,000 megawatts of generation, which is abo=
ut three times its current capacity and would be about 7% of all U.S. capac=
ity. The critical determinant of profitability in power generation is the d=
ifference between natural gas prices and power prices, and Calpine said tha=
t difference, or "spark spread," has grown the past few months. Furthermore=
, the company executives said they are holding to a requirement that all pr=
ojects generate an after-tax return of 18% on the investment.=20
As a result, the company expects earnings to grow at least 40% annually thr=
ough 2005. Calpine will fund near-term cash needs in the debt markets and w=
on't issue new stock until its stock price rises substantially.=20

Spector, Roseman & Kodroff, P.C. Files Class Action Suit Against Enron Corp=
oration

10/25/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 25 /PRNewswire/ -- The law firm of Spector, Roseman & Ko=
droff, P.C. announces that a class action lawsuit has been commenced in the=
 United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston D=
ivision, against defendants Enron Corporation ("Enron" or the "Company") (N=
YSE: ENE), Kenneth L. Lay, Jeffrey K. Skilling, and Andrew Fastow, on behal=
f of purchasers of the common stock of Enron during the period between Janu=
ary 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the "Class Period").=20
The Complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of =
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder,=
 by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market between J=
anuary 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, thereby artificially inflating the pr=
ice of Enron common stock. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Enron i=
ssued a series of statements concerning its business, financial results and=
 operations which failed to disclose (i) that the Company's Broadband Servi=
ces Division was experiencing declining demand for bandwidth and the Compan=
y's efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth were not meeting with =
success as many of the market participants were not creditworthy; (ii) that=
 the Company's operating results were materially overstated as result of th=
e Company failing to timely write-down the value of its investments with ce=
rtain limited partnerships which were managed by the Company's chief financ=
ial officer; and (iii) that Enron was failing to write-down impaired assets=
 on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP. On October 16, 2001, Enron surp=
rised the market by announcing that the Company was taking non-recurring ch=
arges of $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share, in the=
 third quarter of 2001, the period ending September 30, 2001. Subsequently,=
 Enron revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwind=
ing of investments with certain limited partnerships which were controlled =
by Enron's chief financial officer and that the Company would be eliminatin=
g more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding o=
f the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the =
price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. During the Class Period,=
 Enron insiders disposed of over $73 million of their personally held Enron=
 common stock to unsuspecting investors.
If you purchased Enron securities during the Class Period, you may, no late=
r than December 21, 2001, move to be appointed as a Lead Plaintiff in this =
class action. A Lead Plaintiff is a representative, chosen by the Court, th=
at acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. The P=
rivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 directs Courts to assume th=
at the class member(s) with the "largest financial interest" in the outcome=
 of the case will best serve the class in this capacity. Courts have discre=
tion in determining which class member(s) have the "largest financial inter=
est," and have appointed Lead Plaintiffs with substantial losses in both ab=
solute terms and as a percentage of their net worth. If you have sustained =
substantial losses in Enron securities during the Class Period, please cont=
act Spector, Roseman & Kodroff, P.C. at classaction@srk-law.com for a more =
thorough explanation of the Lead Plaintiff selection process. If you have r=
elatively small losses, your ability to participate in any recovery will be=
 protected by the Lead Plaintiff(s), and you need take no affirmative steps=
 at this time.=20
If you wish to discuss this action or have any questions concerning this no=

Enron Draws Down Credit Facility

10/25/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) drew on committed lines of credit t=
o provide cash liquidity of more than $1 billion.=20
In a press release Thursday, the energy company said it has "more than adeq=
uate" liquidity to fulfill business commitments.
Enron said the credit action is a step to restore investor confidence, and =
it plans to update investors in several days regarding plans to maintain it=
s long-term credit rating.=20
Earlier Thursday, Standard & Poor's revised its long-term ratings outlook f=
or Enron to negative due to concerns that the company's significant drop in=
 market capitalization has hurt the company's flexibility and could impair =
plans to rebuild the balance sheet.=20
Over the past week, Enron's shares have fallen more than 40% amid negative =
news from the company.=20
The company's New York Stock Exchange-listed shares closed Thursday at $16.=
35, down 6 cents, or 0.4%, on composite volume of 39,212,300 shares. Averag=
e daily volume is 7,832,606 shares.=20
Early last week, the company reported a $618 million third quarter loss, re=
sulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. Enron also disclosed a $1.2 billi=
on reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminati=
ng certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed=
 by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.=20
On Wednesday, Enron replaced Fastow with Jeff McMahon, effective immediatel=
y.=20

The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that some bond traders believe En=
ron's bonds won't continue to hold up better the company's stock.=20
The company's five-year bond has decreased about 16% in the past two weeks,=
 much less than the 50% decline in Enron's stock price since the Oct. 16 di=
sclosure of the $1.01 billion charges.=20
But the fall in the bond's price translates to a yield of 7.7 percentage po=
ints above bellwether U.S. government bonds, which is widening from about 3=
 percentage points two weeks ago. Although Enron is still an investment-gra=
de credit, that kind of "spread" is more characteristic of a junk bond with=
 a credit rating of single B or lower, the Journal said.=20
On Wednesday, Fitch put Enron's credit rating on watch for a possible downg=
rade, following a similar move by Moody's Investor Service earlier this wee=
k.=20
Several energy trading companies said Thursday that although they have conc=
erns about Enron's credit quality, they have made almost no changes in poli=
cy concerning the company.=20
Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Williams Cos. (WMB) and Aquila Inc. (ILA) said they have=
n't changed their credit policy concerning Enron, which accounts for about =
a quarter of the trade in U.S. power and gas markets.=20
The Journal reported that bond traders expect Enron executives to meet with=
 rating agencies, debt-trading desks, big bond holders and banks next week.=

Enron Employees Watch Options Devalue as Shares Fall (Correct)
2001-10-25 18:41 (New York)

Enron Employees Watch Options Devalue as Shares Fall (Correct)

     (Company corrects structure of standard compensation package
in second paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. prided itself on
sharing the wealth with employees when the company was posting
record profits last year. Now, from the boardroom to the mailroom,
employees are sharing the pain.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, grants stock options to the
bulk of its 20,000 employees. Under Enron's standard compensation
package, most employees get stock options equal to
5 percent of their annual base salary, spokeswoman Meredith
Philipp said.

     Employees held 46.8 million exercisable options as of the end
of 2000, all at average prices above the company's current share
price. The stock has dropped 80 percent this year.

     ``Virtually every option is under water right now,'' Enron
spokeswoman Karen Denne said.

     Enron's board sets the strike price for the options in
December or January. Employees can't cash the options in and make
a profit unless the stock is trading above the strike price. At
the end of 2000, Enron shares were trading at $83.13. In December,
the board set a strike price of about $80.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell 6 cents to $16.35 today.
They have lost 37 percent of their value so far this week.

     Enron said Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission
was asking questions about partnerships run by Andrew Fastow, who
was ousted as Enron's chief financial officer yesterday. One
partnership cost the company $35 million, and Enron bought back 62
million shares from a partnership at a cost of $1.2 billion.

     Enron named Jeff McMahon, head of its industrial markets
group, as CFO late yesterday.

                         Unvested Options

     Another 96.1 million options granted to Enron employees
hadn't vested as of the end of last year. About 15.4 million of
them, or 16 percent, were at prices ranging from $6.88 to $20 a
share. The rest vest at levels well above the current share price.

     Experts who have watched the devaluation of stock options in
other industries, such as technology and telecommunications, say
it becomes demoralizing for workers to watch share prices fall
below their options.

     ``It looks bad,'' said Mark Edwards, chairman of IQuantic
Buck, a Mellon Financial Corp. unit that provides compensation
consulting. ``Employees look at (the stock price) every day, and
it's a continued disincentive to them.''

     While Denne said Enron doesn't have any plans to reprice its
employees' options, the company did issue a one-time stock option
grant at $36.88 in August, when Ken Lay resumed his former role as
the company's chief executive. Lay, who had held the job for 15
years, turned the position over to Jeffrey Skilling in February.
Skilling quit in August, citing family reasons.

     The August grant, which was equivalent to 5 percent of
employees' base salary, didn't require a vesting period, but was
exercisable immediately. Enron's shares haven't closed above
$36.88 since Aug. 29.

Diane,
I have another termination for you.  We killed Y30499.1 and Y55771.1 and made a payment of $94,200 on 10/29/01 which is booked on Y30449.3.  Let me know if you need any additional information.  Thanks.

I told you the wrong dates...it's the 8th and 16th instead of the the 1st and the 8th.

Let me know if you hear anything else about this.

Dawn

All,

The last information I had on Benefits was that Enron benefits would cease on Feb. 8 and UBS benefits would start on Feb. 16.

Obviously, there is a gap here, and UBS/Enron are working to put something in place to cover this period.

If you have anything elective, you might find that it would be simpler if you were to avoid this gap period.

Dave

I will attend.  I'm putting the finishing touches on the Powerpoint presentation as we speak.  Just make sure you brush up on off-balance sheet financing and limited partnerships..........

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

PL

Darron,

Please confirm the following:
1. I can't find the book ENA-WT-SOCAL in Estate database (please provide the CP ID)
2. Move active Financial Deals from NG-PRICE (CP ID 11360)
3. Move active Financial Deals from NG-PR-OPT (CP ID 92649)

Thanks,

tEXas tailgatES talk

We will all need to chip in a few dollars for the ENORMOUS
thank you card going to Stillwater this week. I gave the
Cowboys no chance to win that game, and after seeing the
highlights, reading the paper, etc? I still would give them
no chance. It just goes to show that what I think means
absolutely nothing.

21-7

Wow. This game was eerily similar to the Texas/OU game. Both
defense were stellar, and shutdown the opposition's offense.
Some complaints I have heard center on the lack of offense/offensive
creativity in the A&M game, and Chris Simms' decision making
in the passing game. I disagree. If you were at the game, you
noticed the wind was swirling something fierce, and gusting
upwards of around 30 mph at times. Both punters struggled in
the 1st half, with punts of 15,17,19,17,21 and 24 yards. Aggie
qb Mark Farris threw deep a few times, and was picked off once,
and if not for some superb plays by his wr's, at least twice more.
Texas jumped out early with a t.d off of a blocked punt, and then
went into the play-it-safe mode. Seeing that balls thrown deep
were floating up for grabs and the Aggie offense's inability to
move the ball consistently, the Longhorns played the OU-style
field position game, and kept the crowd out of it (except for
the 39-yard punt return by Mickey Jones in the 3rd quarter, when
Texas te Mike Jones was liquidated on a block) and eventually
wore down the undermanned Aggies with 2 scores late in the 4th.
Could the offense have played better? Sure. They would certainly
be the first to tell you that. Simms, in my opinion, did exactly
what the coaches asked him to do: play it safe, don't go for the
home run, and don't give them anything cheap to fire up the crowd.
He did just that. No turnovers, no silly passes (well, 1). His
touch seemed a little off, throwing behind some receivers on
occasion, but he also looked fantastic in the clutch. He fired a
missile between 2 Aggies to hit Bo Scaife on 3rd & 4 at the Aggie
15 on the games go ahead touchdown drive (Benson scored on the
next play). He took what the defense gave him, and now the 'horns
are in Dallas. Fine with me. A 14-point win at the feared Kyle
Field.  The Texas Defense is ON FIRE. They held the inept Aggie
offense to 165 yards total (117 pass: 48 rush) and 1 touchdown.
A&M Aggie qb Mark Farris was never able to find his receivers,
and twice found Longhorn defenders wide open. Neither offense
looked particularly sharp, but the 'horns found a way to pull
it out. Good teams win. Period.
_________________________________________________
THE BIG XII CHAMPIONSHIP GAME
Texas vs. Colorado
7:00 PM
ABC

Ask and ye shall receive. Here we are. The Longhorns come in
10-1, Winners of the south (thanks, Pokes) and CU comes in 8-2,
claiming the north title. These two unexpected opponents know
each other pretty well. Texas beat the Buffs, 41-7, back on
Oct. 27th in Austin. CU looked a little lost that day, and Texas
pounced on them and wore them down. These are not your October
Buffalos, folks. This team has found itself, and is brimming
with confidence after they thumped Nebraska, 62-36. Put it away,
Buffs, you get the Burnt Orange this week.  Keys for the game:
Texas needs to stop the run (understatement of the year). The
Longhorns will put 8 and 9 in the box to stop the quartet of CU
backs, and dare Bobby Pesavento to beat them. CU has, in my
opinion, the best tight end in college football in Daniel Graham.
He could not be stopped when they met the Huskers, and single
handedly kept the Nebraska db's from crowding the line of
scrimmage. Daniel, this is Nathan Vasher. On offense, Texas will
look for the pass to open the run. Colorado has a suspect
secondary, and the 'horns will try to exploit that with the UT
Towers. If this happens, look for Texas to run well in the 2nd
half.

tEXas tailgate
We are having a tEXas tailgate. It will be located at the
University of Dallas, right across the street from Texas
Stadium. It will begin at 2:00 pm. This seems a little early,
but tickets ordered from the Longhorn Foundation will be picked
up at will call at Gate 10 at Texas Stadium. So you can come by
for a beer and a bbq sandwich, go get your tickets at will call,
and come back for another beer and a sausage wrap, and another
beer? you get the idea.

IT WILL BE FREE OF CHARGE.

That's right. Free. All food and beer will be on a cash basis
(food includes sausage wraps, bbq sandwiches, nachos).
Below is a map to the area around Texas Stadium. The star
represents the U of D campus. There is a pedestrian walkway
from the campus to Texas Stadium.

News and Notes:
* Ced will get his crack at 1,000. The Big XII Championship counts
as a regular season game, so Ced will have another chance to break
RW's record for freshman rushing. Ricky had 12 games his freshman
year, too. He needs 16 yards for the 1,000.
* Benson also set the record freshman touchdowns with his 2 vs. the
Aggies. He has 12 (11 rush/1receiving), breaking Roy Willams' record
of 10 set in 2000.
* Chris Simms passed for 138 yards, giving him 2,473 for the year.
That's 2nd on the all-time list for single season passing yards at
Texas. Unless something really strange happens, that's where he'll
stay. Major holds the record with 3,357 yards (1999).
* Rod Babers blocked his 2nd kick of the season Friday, resulting
in a touchdown after Tony Jeffrey scooped it up. Kool-Aid was the
Co-Special Teams Player of the Week in the Big XII for that effort.
* Texas has now won 8 straight road games.
* The Longhorns post their 1st 10-win season since 1995. They got
their 10th at A&M that year, too.
* The Defense had a season high 4 sacks vs. the A&M Aggies.
* CU is 9-2 this year, tied for the most improved team from 2000
to '01. They were 3-8 in '00, and stand at +6.
* The Buffalos averaged 10.4 yards per carry vs. Nebraska. Yikes.
* Buff tailback Cortlen Johnson needs 49 yards receiving to become
CU's all-time leading career receiver for running backs. He has 677,
and trails Herschel Troutman (725)
* Colorado has only given up 13 sacks in 11 games this season.

Around the Conference:
* Colorado. Wow. 62-36. 62 points. The Buffs had 582 yards, 415
yards rushing. All three are records against the Huskers. 4th
string tailback Chris Brown had 7 touchdowns in the game, a CU
record. That might be more than the Aggies had all season. NU
was definitely looking ahead to Dallas, but I guess they can all
go to tv room in the dorm and watch the game together. They blew
a #1 BCS rating and a shot at the title. The broadcast showed
shocked Nebraska fans in the stands, and one little boy crying.
It makes you feel a little sorry for them. Okay, it passed.
* Kansas beat Wyoming, 27-14. Quarterback Mario Kinsey had 221
yards passing and rb Reggie Duncan rushed for 168 yards and 2
touchdowns. There were 6,500 people at the game. 6,500. There
were more people than that trying to get into K-Mart Friday
morning in south Austin.
* K-State whipped Mizzou, 24-3, on tailback Josh Scobey's 198
yards and 2 touchdowns. He has 31 for his short 2-year career,
tying him for the most t.d.'s in KSU history with Mack Herron
(1968-69). Kansas State is the 8th bowl eligible team in the
Big XII.
* Iowa State beat Iowa, 17-14, in their rivalry game to finish
the year at 7-4. It's the 1st time ever a class of ISU seniors
went 4-0 vs. the Hawkeyes. They should always play this game in
November, not in September.
* Baylor beat Southern Illinois, 56-12. Good for you.
* Tech beat Stephen F. Austin, 58-3. Again, good for you.
* Well, well. Sometimes when I write these, there are things
that happen that I enjoy so much, I want to put them off as
long as possible to savor it. This is one of those times. Let
me get this straight- you lost, AT HOME, to a 3-7 team? 3-7.
It must have been some sort of trick play, I guess. A double
reverse pass back to the punter or something? I can't see any
other way that OSU could score with a TRUE FRESHMAN quarterback
guiding that Offense. Sooner db Derrick Straight said after the
game, "I am in disbelief." You and me both, D. The Sooner
secondary is supposed to be vicious, but they melted down in the
clutch and gave up 2 bombs in the last minute to find a way to
lose. Coach Bob, you seemed so smug in Lubbock after the Texas
players left the Tech game, saying they "had to hope their big
brother knocked us off..." but I guess you forgot about the weak
little sister who just sent you and your legions to Dallas for
New Year's. Bring a coat; it will probably be a little chilly...

That's it for now. The 'horns are 60 minutes from a ring. We need
everybody there to make Dallas our own. Remember, the tailgate
is free, so you should all come.

See you at Christie's on Friday. See you at the tailgate on
Saturday. Let's roll.

As I stated on the phone, the deal is valid and Enron will honor its terms .  I will get a confirmation sent to you.  Thanks

DG

As we discussed, I never received a confirmation of the May, June and July
forward gas purchase (1,000 per day at Ventura at $2.895/mmBtu).  This
purchase was made through Brian Frihart.  I need to know if Enron plans to
stand behind this purchase.  Without confirmation, I will assume that the
deal is no longer valid.

Darron,

Please confirm the following:
1. I can't find the book ENA-WT-SOCAL in Estate database (please provide the CP ID)
2. Move active Financial Deals from NG-PRICE (CP ID 11360)
3. Move active Financial Deals from NG-PR-OPT (CP ID 92649)
4. Commodity code: NG or NGGJ?
5. Please provide the cutoff date to determine active deals (e.g. instr_end_dt > ? 1-jan-2002?)
6. Use ENA CP ID 1305 as the other side counterparty?

If I can have all the answers soon then I think the deals move can be completed around 3:00p.m.

Thanks,
Cecilia
x53362

Cecilia,
In addition to moving the deals detailed in my previous email, please move only financial deals with the same counterparties from NG-PR-OPT to ENA-WT-SOCAL.  I realize it's a big list, but how long will the entire process take?  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

DG

Attached is a long list of counterparty names to move from NG-PRICE into ENA-WT-SOCAL.  Please move only financial deals only.  Please let me know when this is complete.  Thanks.

DG

Congratulations!  Enron will most likely file Ch 11.  Either today or tomorrow.  It's pretty crazy.  I really don't know what the future holds.  I will just have to wait and see.  We definitely want to go skiing.  Most likely in the spring.  I may have to wait and see how this thing plays out though.  I am going to Dallas on Saturday and we may stay at your sisters place.  They sure kicked the shit out of the Huskers.  I'll keep in touch.

DG

Darron,
 
What's up?  I do not know if your  mother told you, but Tracie and I are expecting in June!  We are very  excited.
 
I know it is probably a sore subject, but  what the hell is going on with Enron?  Are you looking for another job or  are you not effected?
 
Let me know if you guys are planning to  go skiing again this year.  I will keep my eyes open for deals.  
 
I'll talk to you later and watch out for  those Buffaloes on Saturday night!
 
Sean

you got one?

Dude, you need to start wearing a bulletproof vest around there.

Absoulutely.  When the Texas Monthly article came out, ENE was around $30.  We have been told basically nothing.  Which is not unlike what has been going on during the entire collapse........At least they are consistent.  But we did have attorneys describing what Ch 11 would be like, so I suspect it is only a matter of time until the filling.  We shall see.

DG

The good thing about campaign work is you're drunk by the time
you see that you're fucked.

I guess that Texas Monthly writer will be up for the Pulitzer.

Have they told y'all anything?

We are going to Dallas.  I bought the tickets the week of the OU game.  Thought I would be selling them until last Sat evening.  I think a 5% chance at Pasadena.  I think it comes down to Miami-VT.  Florida should cruise at home against Tenn and anyone in the SEC west on the carpet in Atlanta.  But stranger things have happened........

DG

Well, I feel your pain. Sorry, it came down like that.

So what do your think our chances are of getting in the Rose Bowl?
Are ya'll going to Dallas?

Attention: All Enron Employees

HireSynergy wants to express its condolences for everyone at Enron. We have
met and developed relationships with many of you over the years, and have
heard the disappointing news with both the job losses and the invasion of
privacy by the news and media. Since Tuesday 12/4 seems to be the last known
day of employment for most of you, we are offering everyone at Enron the
following immediate services at no charge, so please forward this email to
all of your friends and colleagues:

How HireSynergy can help you NOW:

1) Resume writing tips that help you get the interview
2) Interview techniques to help you get the job offer, even if your
technical skills aren't an exact match
3) Identify specific job opportunities that match your background and
criteria (as opposed to you applying via the internet or Human Resources job
postings, and not hearing back for weeks or being completely overlooked.).

HireSynergy is a retainer and contingency search firm that traditionally
charges fees to clients for our services.  However, since most of Enron's
major competitors already have access to you, our contribution to the Enron
community is proactively helping everyone through the job search process,
regardless of what stage of the interview process you're in.

HireSynergy specializes in the areas of Accounting, Tax, Finance and Risk
Management.
In addition, we have a division that places Executive Secretaries and all
clerical/ administrative staff.

We are walking distance from Enron! Please give us a call at 713-222-7667.

Osama  Goes To Hell
One day in the future, Osama bin Laden has a heart attack and dies.  He immediately goes to hell, where the devil is waiting for him. 
"I  don't know what to do here," says the devil. "You are on my list, but I have  no room for you. You definitely have to stay here, so I'll tell you what I'm  going to do. I've got a couple of folks here who weren't quite as bad as you.  I'll let one of them go, but you have to take their place. I'll even let YOU  decide who leaves." 
Osama thought that sounded pretty good, so he  agreed. The devil opened the first room; in it was Richard Nixon and a large  pool of water. He kept diving in and surfacing empty handed -- over and over  and over. Such was his fate in hell. 
"No," bin Laden said. "I don't  think so. I'm not a good swimmer and I don't think I could do that all day  long." 
The devil led him to the next room; in it was Tony Blair with a  sledgehammer and a room full of rocks. All he did was swing that hamm! er,  time after time after time. 
"No, I've got this problem with my  shoulder. I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all  day," commented Osama bin Laden. 
The devil opened a third door. In it,  Osama saw Bill Clinton, lying on the floor with his arms staked over his head,  and his legs staked in a spread eagle pose. Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky,  doing what she does best. 
Osama bin Laden looked at this in disbelief  for a while and finally said, "Yeah, I can handle this." 
The devil  smiled and said, "OK, Monica, you're free to go."

tEXas tailgatES talk

Okay, I have come off of the ledge. I thought about a
lot of things when I was out there: what if the punt
was tipped, what if it was a safety, what in the world
was going through Gary Barnett's mind on that fake punt,
what if the field goal was good, wow, it's really high
up here... Mostly I thought this: no more Dallas. Let's
not play any more games in the DFW area, nothing good
happens. We will meet the Okies in Waco and play'em at
Baylor. Who's going to mind?
Certainly not the Bears (they really don't use the field
much any way) and certainly not me.

39-37

If you were a 3rd party observer, this game was probably
very exciting. Texas goes up early, Colorado roars ahead
at half, and Texas fights back, but falls just short. I
AM NOT a 3rd party observer. The Horns were so close. 2
points away from a Big XII Championship. D'oh! Give the
Buffaloes their credit, they brought that nasty running
game that we all thought was an aberration vs. Nebraska.
Chris Brown looked liked he was 9 feet tall (have you
ever seen a guy run higher than him? He makes Eddie George
look like a hunchback It was like watching Michael Johnson
sprint) and the CU o-line was just evil. 3 or 4 of those
guys will be playing on Sundays next year. On defense, the
'horns lack of size showed. It's hard to stop a power
running game that's clicking with small tackles, or even
big ones- ask Nebraska, and quick defensive ends. To their
credit, the Texas defense did not fold, but fought the
good fight and stemmed the tide, holding CU to 10 points
in the 2nd half. The 1st half was the killer.  The 1st half.
Oh. The Horns looked great to start the game, but things
went wrong. Chris Simms didn't play well, and would be the
1st to tell you that it was his worst game at Texas so far.
3 interceptions and 1 fumble. Ouch. Cedric Benson was
running well, 13 carries for 79 yards and a score, before
he was hurt with a pinched nerve. The 'horns got down 29-10
and it looked like they would be blown out (that's sort of
how the OU game in 2000 started), but they refused to die,
and fought back to near even. Major Applewhite went from
cult hero to certified legend by throwing a 79 yd touchdown
pass on his 2nd play after replacing an injured Simms, and
Texas nearly pulled it out, but was too far back in the
long run.  I want to talk about Simms for a second. It would
be absurd to say that those 4 turnovers weren't the main
reason Texas lost. It was. Chris played badly. Horrible.
There is no other way to say it. He is a big boy, and I am
quite sure he has the mental toughness to hear this
(and I'm sure he has) and learn from it. It was not your
day, Lefty, turn the page and move on. Everybody has them.
Ty Detmer threw 7 picks in 1 game this year. Kurt Warner had
4 v. the Saints. You will no doubt have more of those when
you get to the League in 2003. There is no shame in playing
bad, as long as you learn something from it. You had 2 bad
days in '01, but you also had 10 good ones, and 3 or 4 great
ones. Get that 2 down to 1 next year, and you will hear no
complaints from me; of course I'm not speaking for everyone...

I thought the coaches called a good game. Greg Davis opened
up the playbook with some reverses and deep middle-stuff,
and Carl Reese was working up-hill most of the night and
still held CU to 111 passing and 334 total. The blocked
punt call, in my opinion, was a good call. Texas got one
at A&M, and needed some help at that point. To ask the Horns
to go 80 + yards through the air (there was no Benson, so
no running game) with your big tackle (Mike Williams) out
of the game would have been a tall order. Get the block, and
you set up shop at mid-field or even run it back for 6.
They didn't get the block, obviously. Teams call the punt-block
all of the time, but don't hit the kicker. The kid for Texas
missed the punt by 2 inches, but fell into the CU punter.
1st down. Tough break. Hindsight is 20/20, but I would call
it again.

tEXas tailgate-
is in the works. It will not be the traditional tailgate
like last year, but more of a gathering somewhere (like a

___________________________________________________
News and Notes:
* Major Applewhite will start the Holiday Bowl.
* Cedric got his 1,000. Benson only played a half, but his
79 yards put him at 1,053 yards for the year. He is the 9th
player to rush for a grand at Texas.
* Major Applewhite's 233 yards passing give him 8,059 career
yards, breaking the all-time record of 8,049
(James Brown, 1994-97).
* The Vapor is good. Nathan Vasher tied a school record with
7 interceptions in a season. He also had 54 yards in punt
returns, giving him 554 for the year, breaking the school
record of 538 (Johnnie Johnson - 1977).
* B.J. Johnson's 79 yard touchdown catch was his 4th reception
of 70 + yards. All have been touchdowns. B.J. had his 1st
2 t.d. game, and his 4th 100-yard game.
* D.D. Lewis started his 50th consecutive game Saturday,
breaking the school record of 49 held by Dan Neil (1993-1996).
* Hats off to Alfio Randall. The Big Cat filled in for an
injured Mike Williams, and did not let his man touch Applewhite.
* The home team is 6-0 in Big XII Championship games. The home team
is the one who travels the farthest, and usually is outnumbered
in the stands.
* Through their first 15 starts, Major Applewhite and Chris Simms
have identical 12-3 records.

Around the Conference:
* Coach Bob lost his offensive coordinator. Mark Mangino
accepted the Head Coaching  job at Kansas. Sorry, Coach Bob.
Mangino should be okay there, if he can recruit.
* 8 bowl teams from the Big XII. That is a conference record.
Here is who they are, where they're going and when they play,
in the order they were picked by the bowls..

COLORADO - BCS v. TBA
NEBRASKA - BCS v. TBA
OKLAHOMA- Cotton Bowl v. SEC team, Jan. 1st
TEXAS- Holiday Bowl v. Washington, Dec. 28th
TEXAS TECH- Alamo Bowl v. Iowa, Dec. 29th
KANSAS STATE- Insight.com Bowl v. Syracuse, Dec. 29th
IOWA STATE- MainStay Independence Bowl v. SEC team, Dec. 27th
TEXAS A&M- Galleryfurniture.com Bowl v. winner of
Southern Mississippi/TCU, Dec. 29th

Next week I will begin breaking down the Holiday Bowl, as
well as the other bowl games (we will know who plays who
next week). Expect another email about
the tailgate coming soon.

See you later, and do not hesitate to let me know what you think!
Most of you already know that...

A woman goes into Walmart to buy a rod and reel for
her Husband's birthday. She doesn't know which one to
get so she just grabs one and goes over to the counter.

A Walmart "associate" is standing there with dark
shades on. She says, "Excuse me sir ... can you tell me anything about this
rod and reel?"
He says, "Ma'am I'm completely blind, but if you'll
drop it on the counter I can tell you everything you need to know about it
from the sound it makes."
She doesn't believe him, but drops it on the counter
anyway. He says, "That's a six-foot Shakespeare graphite rod with Zebco 404
reel and 10-poundtest line.
It's a good all around combination and it's on sale
this week for only $20.00."
She says, "It's amazing that you can tell all that
just by the sound of it dropping on the counter; I'll
take it."
The woman opens her purse and sees her credit card
holder drop on the floor. As she bends down to pick it up and passes gas.
At first she is really embarrassed, but then concludes
there is no way he could tell it was she that farted.
Being blind, he wouldn't know that she
was the only person around.
The man rings up the sale and says, "That'll be $34.50
please." The woman is totally confused by this and says,
"Didn't you tell me it was on special for $20.00? How
did you get $34.50?"
He replies, "Yes Ma'am, the rod and reel is $20.00;
but the duck call is $11.00 and the catfish bait is $3.50.

 << File: ENA Participation.xls >> 
All,

The below Analyst & Associate recruiting dates require ENA participation at Manager level at above.   In order to resource each of your departments it is important to have ENA's involvement and participation in the interviews and debrief sessions on Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday events.     These de-brief sessions will allow you the opportunity to select candidates you wish to join your groups.  The target  is to assign potential candidates to business units and departments from the outset.

As ENA has the highest percentage of A&A rotating in its business unit, the participation of ENA at interview should reflect this.     Therefore, please encourage your direct reports and managers to participate in the below events in order to secure candidates for your business area.

Associate Recruiting:		Saturday November 3						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview
Analyst Recruiting:		Friday, November 16						Total - 70 Candidates for Interivew
Associate Recruiting:		Saturday, December 1						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview

The above spreadsheet represents ENA's particpation today which I believe highlights the need for much additional support in these efforts.

Please confirm by return participation of your respective groups.

Regards,

Karen Buckley

Kimberly, please have the staff e-mail you the comments that they made yesterday about the states/areas/accounts they are covering.  I want you to put together a summary for everyone on this matter.  In addition, I want to get a list from everyone of any markets that are no longer willing to transact with ENA due to credit issues.  Need the list today.

Sorry to hear that.  I hope everything goes well at work.  My company is crumbling.  It's pretty scary.  A combination of being too far out of downtown and too many trees meant that I couldn't get a good signal.  I ended up getting a cable modem.  I really didn't want to do that because I absolutely hate Time Warner.  And what do you know, they screwed up my first bill.

DG

Hey Darron,
I don't think I'm going to be able to make it down for the game.  My
department just went through a big lay off, everyone got let go but me,
so I'm pretty busy right now trying to make sure the transition goes ok.
I was thinking about trying to take some time off over the holidays,
making my way down to Dallas and LA.  If schedules work out, maybe we
could arrange a visit then.  I'm really sorry.  I was looking forward to
seeing you and the family, enjoy watching KU get beat really bad... but
the timing just really stinks.

Periodically, I need some help in data gathering for analysis.  Is it
possible for someone at Enron to occasionally provide the gas market data
that I need?

I would like to look at the following data for 1999 and 2000 prior to our
November 13 meeting.

*	Daily Henry Hub Prices
*	Daily Ventura Prices
*	Monthly Index Henry Hub (Inside FERC Gas Market Report)
*	Monthly Index Ventura (Inside FERC Gas Market Report)

Please give me a call.

The file was too big to email.  It contains all financial deals (P,B,I,GD) in the active NG-PRICE book.  It does not contain any option deals.  I will set up the new books so that we can move the net positive deals by counterparty.  Let me know if you have any questions.  It is saved in O:/_Dropbox.

DG

No.  We are going up without tickets.  People who have been say there are usually plenty available.  Don't worry about the $.  I don't like ND, but from experience, it is better whent the home team wins.  The LSU-AU game a couple of years ago just wasn't as exciting as AU-Florida or Wisconsin-Minnesota.  But the fun thing about it is I really don't care who wins.  

DG

Hey...have we had any luck locating NDvTEN tickets yet? How about da Bears game? Just curious.....I may have to bum some $ for tickets...At least till turkey day...I should have some extra cash by then.  So who are going to be rooting for in the games? I can't decide if I want to pull for the SEC or ND...I can't really root for Tenn.  I'll call you tonite to shoot the shit..LAter...Carlos

Carl,
I was traveling on Friday.  The Doubletree is the closest.  I'll get you a number.  Dinner on Monday is a good idea.  If you have a 5:30pm flight, leaving the office at 3:00pm will give you enough time to return a car and get to the terminal.
DG

Is the closest hotel to the Enron office the Doubletree?  Do you have an
address or phone number?

I was thinking that perhaps we should plan to have dinner on Monday evening.
This would be a good opportunity to get acquainted.  Are you available?
Please let me know as we have not made our airline reservations.

I think we will take the 5:30 flight back to Minneapolis.  I assume that we
should plan to leave the office no later than 3:00.  Will this work or do we
need to leave earlier?

Everything is lumped together, meaning price, basis, and index, in that file.

DG

Do you have quantities at price or is it all calculations?

Thanx,
Laura

This is the last file I sent Dierdre.  It has four tabs.  One summarizes the monthly cash flow into two columns (Peoples Deal and PERC Deal).  The monthly values are PV'd.  The PERC tab is the Lagrasta deals.  The Peoples Deal is broken into two tabs (Baseload Sale and Transport).  The baseload sale includes all of the price fixing deals as well as the index -$.03 deal.  Transport is just that.  I hope this helps.

DG

 << File: PeoplesSummary.xls >>

Yes, by Skilling mostly.  I can't believe that a handful of people brought the company all the way down to the point of bankruptcy.  Basically, they took all the money that the core businesses made and pissed it all away in poor investments (broadband, India, Azurix, etc...)  I just hope I have a job thru the holidays.  I feel vulnerable because I'm the new one in this group.  I would feel more secure if I was still in risk.  Oh well, I guess it's wait and see.

DG

What the heck is going on?  Do you feel lied to?

Carl,
I was supposed to be traveling this morning, but because of the crash in NY it has been postponed to tomorrow.  I will be in a Dallas airport at the time of our call tomorrow morning.  Should I use 763-241-2490 as the number to use for our conference call?  If not, let me know.  I look forward to our conversation.  Thanks

DG 

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a "new approach", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

I was sorry to hear about your mother.  I tried to call last night but you were not at home.  I told mom and she asked for your number.  I don't know if you have heard, but Enron was purchased by Dynegy on Friday.  The deal will not close until Q3 '02, but this will obviously affect me in some manner.  We will see.  Take care.

You have two cows.  You sell three of them to your publically listed company using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank.  

Then, you execute a debt-equity swap with an associated general officer, so you get all four cows back, with a tax-exemption for the fifth cow, of course.

The rights to the estimated future value of the milk cash flow stream of the six cows are monetized and transferred via an intermediary to the Caymen Islands, secretly owned by a majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company, off-balance sheet, of course. 

The annual report says the company owns eight cows and recognizes milk revenue for the 20 year life of the cows.

This is hedged with derivative cow life insurance policy through a Caymen Island bank, and these hedges are arranged through EnronOnline's commodity storefront with an option to buy one more cow, no balance sheet provided.....

The company says it will file all footnotes at a later date.

Thanks.  I wanted to see what refinancing to a 15 year would look like.  I just talked to him.  Things are wierd and I know it must be even worse moving to a new group.  I'm glad you like it over there.  I guess it's just wait and see.

Here is a test of several items you have learned in the Excel class so far.

I have set up a basic program structure for you that opens a file and reads the file, line by line, into the variable "sBuf".

You should write functions that tally the results asked for on Sheet1  (number of lines in the file, number of characters, etc).  A user should be able to enter a search (source) string.  Given the string you should also search for how many times it occurs in the file under 3 different conditions (case-sensitive, case-insensitive and as a "word" - separated by blanks).

You should have all the basic concepts down to complete the program fairly easily.  Work on this project and we will discuss it on the Monday following Thanksgiving.

I will be out tomorrow and next week.

Have fun!

HERE IT IS.

I was out of the office on Friday.  I'll call you later this morning with a quote.  Thanks.

ANYONE REMEMBER THIS??
IT WAS 1987!
At a UNC lecture the other day they played an old video
of Lt. Col. Oliver North testifying at the Iran-Contra hearings during
the Reagan Administration. There was Ollie in front of God and country
getting the third degree. But what he said was stunning!! He was being
drilled by some senator;

"Did you not recently spend close to $60,000 for a home
security system?"
Ollie replied, "Yes I did sir."
The senator continued, trying to get a laugh out of the
audience, "Isn't this just a little excessive?"
'No sir,' continued Ollie.
"No? And why not?" the senator asked.
"Because the lives of my family and I were threatened
sir."
'Threatened? By whom?" the senator questioned.
'By a terrorist, sir.' Ollie answered.
'Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that
much?"
"His name is Osama bin Laden sir." Ollie replied.

At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but couldn't
pronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn't. A couple of
people laughed at the attempt. Then the senator continued.

"Why are you so afraid of this man?" the senator asked.
"Because sir, he is the most evil person alive that I
know of," Ollie answered.
"And what do you recommend we do about him?" asked the
senator.
"Well sir, if it were up to me, I would recommend that
an assassin team be formed to eliminate him and his men from the face of
the earth."

The senator disagreed with this approach and that was
all that was shown
of the clip.

It seems everyone agreed to Ninfa's.  Let's meet at 11:45; let me know if a
different time is better.  Ninfa's is located in the tunnel under the JP

Patrick,
Terry Brownrig and I did a small phys basis deal this afternoon.  It was 988/d ANR/SW we are selling @ NX1 - $.155  He called later saying he may want to also do a Jan02-Mar02 deal also.  This is just giving you a headsup for when he calls.  If so, you would need to get the quote from Andy.  Have a good Thanksgiving.

Good.  The game is in Irving, so I will try to find a hotel around there.  It is also at 7:00pm.  We will get into town early so we can come by and see you guys.  You moved to a new house, right?  I'll keep you posted.

We are going to be in Dallas for the Big XII Championship game on

Please take notice of the red cells.  These Tagg numbers were incorrect and I have changed the cells to the correct Tagg deal number.  All of the deals on this list have been moved to the bankrupcy book.

I bought the tickets the week of the Texas-OU game.  Up until Sat night, I was planning on selling them to a guy I work with who went to OU.  I never thought about a hotel because I really never thought UT would be in the game.  I really don't want to put you guys out, especially with a new baby.  We are bringing Christopher (he is really excited about going) and a high school aged neighbor (his girlfriend's brother is on the team).  If you truly don't mind, then I will talk to Kristi about it.  We'll see.  How's the new house?  Is Flower Mound a little west of Lewisville?  I'm not good on Dallas geography.

DG

If you need a place to stay, you are more than welcome to stay with us. We moved to Flower Mound, but it is still pretty good access to Texas Stadium.

HOOK'EM

Norman (AP)

Oklahoma University Athletic Director Joe Castiglione announced today that
due to recent developments, the renovations at Owen Field are well ahead of
schedule and will come in under costs. Seems over 71,000 fans shit a brick
during the fourth quarter of the bedlam football game, providing the
necessary materials to begin work right away.

His list does not include any of the transport positions.  It also includes some deals with the Chicago office that should not be included in the deal value.

DG

 

This is it.  I am leaving the office for the rest of the morning.  I will return after lunch.

DG

 

This is it.  It should be self explanatory.  There are values for Jan02 and Feb02 in the file.  The value increased a little more than I expected.  I didn't have time to compare the numbers from my last run at it in December.  I will in the morning.  I also still need to find the true value on the weather deal.

DG

 

I'm in.  I'll be shredding 'till 11am so I should have plenty of time to make it.

DG

Count me in.  How about Ninfa's over by your office in the tunnels?

Let me know if you can still make lunch this Thursday, 1/24/02.  If you
have suggestions for time & place, let me know that as well.

This is the last file I sent Dierdre.  It has four tabs.  One summarizes the monthly cash flow into two columns (Peoples Deal and PERC Deal).  The monthly values are PV'd.  The PERC tab is the Lagrasta deals.  The Peoples Deal is broken into two tabs (Baseload Sale and Transport).  The baseload sale includes all of the price fixing deals as well as the index -$.03 deal.  Transport is just that.  I hope this helps.

The Cost of  Children 
I have seen repeatedly the breakdown of the cost of 
raising  a child, but this is the first time I have seen the 
rewards listed this way.  It's nice, really nice! 
The government recently calculated the cost  
of raising a child from birth to 18 and came up with 
$160,140! That  doesn't even touch college tuition. 
For those with kids, that figure  leads to wild fantasies about 
all the money we could have banked if not for  (insert your child's name 
here). 
For others, that number might confirm  the decision to remain childless. 
But $160,140 isn't so bad if you break  it down. It translates 
into $8,896.66 a year, $741.38 a month, or $171.08 a  week. 
That's a 
 mere $24.44 a day! Just over a dollar an hour.  
 Still, you might think the best financial advice says don't  
 have children if you want to be "rich". It is just the opposite.  
 What do you get for your $160,140? 
Naming rights.  First, middle, and last! 
 Glimpses of God every day.  
 Giggles under the covers every night. 
 More love than  your heart can hold. 
  Butterfly kisses and Velcro hugs.  
 Endless wonder over rocks, ants, clouds, and warm cookies.  
 A hand to hold, usually covered with jam. 
 A partner  for blowing bubbles, flying kites, building 
 sandcastles, and skipping  down the sidewalk in the pouring rain. 
 Someone to laugh yourself  silly with no matter what 
 the boss said or how your stocks performed  that day. 
 For $160,140, you never have to grow up.  
 You get to finger-paint, carve pumpkins, play hide-and-seek,  
 catch lightning bugs, and never stop believing in Santa Claus.  
 You have an excuse to keep: reading The Adventures of Piglet  
 and Pooh, watching Saturday morning cartoons, going to Disney  
 movies, and wishing on stars. 
 You get to frame rainbows,  hearts, and flowers under 
 refrigerator magnets and collect spray  painted noodle 
 wreaths for Christmas, hand prints set in clay for  
 Mother's Day, and cards with backward letters for 
 Father's  Day. 
 For $160,140, there is no greater bang for your buck.  
 You get to be a hero just for retrieving a Frisbee off the  
 garage roof, taking the training wheels off the bike, removing a  
 splinter, filling the wading pool, coaxing a wad of gum out of  
 bangs, and coaching a baseball team that never wins but always  
 gets treated to ice cream regardless. 
 You get a front  row seat to history; to witness the first step, 
 first word, first bra,  first date, and first time behind the wheel. 
 You get to be  immortal. 
 You get another branch added to your family tree, and  
 if you're lucky, a long list of limbs in your obituary called  
 grandchildren. 
 You get an education in psychology,  nursing, criminal 
 justice, communications, and human sexuality that no  
 college can match. 
 In the eyes of a child, you rank  right up there with God. 
 You have all the power to heal a boo-boo,  scare away 
 the monsters under the bed, patch a broken heart,  
 police a slumber party, ground them forever, and love 
 them  without limits, so one day they will, like you, 
 love without counting  the cost. 
 ENJOY YOUR KIDS (and grandkids) !!!!!!

Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan and I have been working from a report provided by Russell Diamond that lists "live" deals for counterparties and our current exposure.  Based on that list, here are some deals that need to be moved into the bankruptcy books.  There will be many more deals listed to move on Tuesday.  Please note that deals for many of the counterparties listed on Russell's report have already been moved into the bankruptcy books due to auto-termination.

Once we finish looking at the "live" counterparties, we will continue providing deal information for new contracts that are added to the Master Log report compiled by Legal.  I will be adding the deals from Cyndie's sheets on Tuesday.  I have 8 more counterparties to review from Russell's report and that information will be provided on Tuesday as well.

Please call if you have any questions.

Yes.  I talked to Carlos yesterday so I'm pretty sure he is too.  I'm just waiting on the fallout from the UBS purchase of my organization.  It is supposed to be in front of the bankruptcy court today.  I'll let you know.

Carley has learned to ride her bike.  She is pretty excited about it.  We will come see you this weekend.

As long as accounting doesn't have a problem with it, I don't see why not.  The P&L will probably need to be redone for the 31st (Jan) and 1st (Feb).  It just depends on what deals change.  If it is only annuities, then only last day will need to be recalced.

DG

thanks.  I'll look at the PGL deals in a few minutes

We think we may have found part of the problem.  We believe that the problem may be in the way we booked annuities to zero Nov & Dec activity for NSS year 3.  I would like to bounce it off you when we pull all the info together.

Once we correct the problem, we need to change Jan for EMW and enovate.  Phyllis said it was not too late.  Do you know of any reason that we couldn't restate Jan today?

I'll call you later.

I think I would like to start the 529 plan for each kid.  Can I transfer either the custodial or Ed IRA $$??  I just tried to call, but no one answered.  With all the craziness here, I'm not sitting by my phone.  If you call, ask the person to messenger me.  

DG

Darron,

Sorry, things have been hectic lately... How did you like that Horns game???

As for the Ed IRA.. they have raised the limits to $2K

You should however consider the Section 529 plans that I believe we have
discussed previously.  Call me to discuss further.

Attached is a file that has all of the Central Region EOL products.  EOL needs to reassign trader names and books to these products.  I realize that not all products will initially be active, but we are in the process of getting everything ready for the restart of trading business.

I managed all back office issues of an asset management deal with Brooklyn Union Gas Company.  It was a two year deal in which Enron was assigned all of the utilities' assets (supply contracts, transportation contracts, and storage contracts) and then became responsible for providing 100% of the gas requirements of BUG.  I was involved in the negotiations to sign the deal, mostly working with the supply group of BUG doing due diligence on their contracts.  I created a complex invoice model and worked with our trading group, our logistics group, our risk management group, and gas accounting group.  In addition, I made monthly trips to New York to manage the customer and take care of any issues.  It was a $24MM/Year deal.  I was the point person on this deal and worked on it for a year and a half before handing it off to someone else when I moved to risk.

I was involved in another asset management deal with Peoples Gas Company in Chicago.  I also did due diligence work and was involved in negotiations on the deal.  I also created invoice models.  I did not do the day to day work because I was on my way to risk management.  We started a joint venture with Peoples in Chicago.  I set up the risk management department and managed all mid and back office issues of the joint venture.  I managed two book administrators who worked in the Chicago office and made monthly visits to address any issues.  This office made $12MM in its first year and we had no issues from a risk management or accounting perspective.

I took over managing the West desk in risk when there was a $10MM flash to actual variance in the region.  Flash to actual is the difference between the reported P&L and the GL.  Within 3 months I had identified the variances and cleared them.  On a going forward basis I kept the variance at zero.  I identified problems in scheduling that were causing these variances and took proactive steps to fix the problem.  After managing the desk for 6 months, I was able to have everyone cross trained on other books.  This resulted in me being able to reduce the staff by one, saving the company approx $100K/Year.

This is fuckin great!!

Hey guys,
This is a reminder that the Crawfish Boil is this Saturday at our house.
 We usually get started around 2:00 and go on until late.  Drop by anytime.
 Everyone is welcome and feel free to bring friends and family.  We'll have
140-160 pounds of mudbugs so there's always enough for everyone.  There'll
be a couple of kegs.  You may want to bring a blanket or chair to sit on.

A quick reminder on getting here:
+ Go West on Corporate Drive from I-35 or 121 Business.
+ Go through SS at Edmonds
+ Go until you pass about 10 streets on your right.
+ Start looking for Brittany Drive on your right.
+ Turn right on Brittany.  The street turns to the left.
+ We are the last house on the left.  (901 Brittany - 2 Story Grey brick
with flag)
If you want to pull the map off of MapBlast, our address is 901 Brittany
Drive, Lewisville, 75067.

There is also parking on the street next to ours in front of the field (on
Regency)

Hm 972-459-3938     Cell 214-632-1981
Look forward to seeing you.
BW & VW

I can't remember if I RSVP'd or not.  I will be there with my wife.  Thanks.

DG

Mike,
In my opinion Onkyo is just a better quality product than Kenwood, thus the price discrepancy.  I (and this is just me) would not buy a Kenwood.  I would buy Onkyo, Denon, Yamaha, or Harman Kardon.  These are more expensive, but I think better than Sony, Kenwood, JVC, Technics, and Pioneer.  The Onkyo 696 is a great receiver.  And I know you can beat the Crutchfield price.  The sites I would check out are onecall.com, soundcity.com, jandr.com, hifi.com.  You also need to look at audioreview.com.  You can see other peoples opinions of products they have actually purchased.  It is a great site.  They will also indicate where they purchased the equipment and how much they paid.  On those sites to buy that I mentioned, you need to call and talk to someone.  They will give you a better price than advertised on the internet.  Give me a call @ 713-853-9573.  I leave for Chicago later this afternoon.
DG

Darron,

What's going on?  How are Kristi and the kids?  How is that Mustang running?
Hey, I finally got the Tahoe.  Still trying to sell the TA..interested?
Just kidding.  Hey, I am starting to look at receivers and had a question or
two (I got the latest Crutchfield Magazine - what website did Scott use to
order his stuff??)

How important is THX Select/Ultra?

Onkyo has a couple of receivers (TX-DS595 and TX-DS696 for $500 and $800)
that have Dolby Digital, DTS, and Dolby Pro Logic II, and 0.08% THD at
75watts X  5 and 0.08% THD at 100 watts X 5 (both 20 - 20 khz), but are not
THX Select.

If you want THX Select on an Onkyo, you are looking at prices of $1000 and
up.

Kenwood has a new one (VR-510) that has THX Select, Dolby Digital, DTS and
Pro Logic II, but it has 0.7% THD at 110watts X 5 (20-20khz).  Crutchfield
has it at $600.  Is the 0.7% THD too high?  I read an article that said you
should try to keep it below 0.1%.

It's good to hear from you.  The game is November 10th.  And we hope you come down, it would be alot of fun.  We are getting ready to go to Disney World on Saturday.  The kids are pumped.  First I guess you should see if I'm the coverage area.  We are at:

14343 Millstone Estates Ln.
Cypress, TX  77429
281-304-8303

Right now, we just have dial-up internet service and a local calling company that also gives us 100 minutes of long-distance.  We get off pretty cheap on this, but I would be willing to give this ION a try.  Let me know.

DG

Hi Darron,
Hope all is well with you and your family.  Boy, do I have an offer for
you!!!

Sprint is looking for consumers in Houston to test our new ION
technology.  ION stands for Intergrated On-Demand Network.  It basically
provides your voice service and your data service over the same phone
line.  ION offers several different products.  There is a 1 phone line
version, 2 phone lines and up to 4 phone lines.  We also offer just a
data/internet access only product.  The real benefit with ION is that
when you have one phone line, you can be on the internet and talking on
the phone at the same time.

Burton and Susan:  We are setting up new Physical books for the West in SITARA.  There will be five new books, but we will need each book to have 2 sides, the intra-month book and the firm (FT) book for our hedges.  Below is the list of traders and the new book names:

Trader		Intra-month Book		FT Book
Randy Gay		ENA-IM West Keystone		FT-West Keystone
Tori Kuykendall	ENA-IM West SOCAL		FT-West SOCAL
Jane Tholt		ENA-IM West SJ		FT-West SJ
Matt Lenhart	ENA-IM West PGE		FT-West PGE
Steve South		ENA-IM West Rockies		FT-West Rockies

I have attached a Book Request From that contains an entry for each new book.

 

We will need these requests filled as soon as practical. Our plan is to begin putting new transactions into these books starting bid week this month.. Please let me know what additional information you will need.

Thanks

I heard you had an email address and wanted to see if it worked.  How are things.  We are pretty wet here, I've heard you are as well.  We got back from Disney World last week.  Things are OK here.  The kids are excited about summer.  They will probably get in the pool everyday.  More to follow.  Try and stay dry.

DG

I'm sure you know by know, but Houston got it pretty bad over the weekend.  We were OK, but the flooding was unbelievable.  We were at Lake Conroe (K's parents live on the lake) on Friday night.  It rose at least 3 feet (and it's a big lake!) in a matter of 5 hours.  My boat is on a lift out of the water.  In the morning it was floating.  Their dock is underwater.  I've never seen anything like it.  I hope everyone over there is alright.  Have you seen the newest edition?  We hope to get down your way sometime this summer.  Until then stay dry and take care.

DG

Kristi wants to know if you are still willing to have the kids for a week in July.  If so, we need to make plans.  Let us know.

DG

Yes I am.

Piggy, are you still there?
Hey sugar, I am still at work, just waiting on the IT people to set up a new
folder in the UBS directory so that I can move all my files over.  Once that
is done I will be leaving.  I will probably go directly to the Container
Store.  Just let me know if that is okay.

Are you getting hungry?  Do you want me to bring something?  Or do you want
to eat at home.

Love you

The Pigs

Hey Reggie, 

How are you doing?  I don't know if you remember me but I was a friend of Chris Larson's.  I was wondering what you  guys are going to do with the furniture and the flat screens?  Do you need any help selling them?  Will you offer any to the employees?

I know you are busy in these times.  If you get a chance, call me at x.36247 or at home (713) 527-8743.

Thank you and have a great day.  Hope all is well with you and your family.

Steven,

John Arnold asked me to send you this report.  It is from our position on 11/2/01.  Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  I can be reached via email or by phone (713) 853-6247.  Thanks.

John Griffith

 

John,

Thank you for pulling me aside and reinforcing your confidence in me and also putting things into perspective.  I guess the reason I was a little upset is that I feel that we are a family here.  I spend more time with you guys than I do with my wife.  I felt a little betrayed.  I should not have felt that way.  You guys have given me the oppurtunity of a lifetime, I am very thankful for that.  I have never questioned the importance of you or Mike of anyone on our desk.  

Please forgive me if I have been a little down.  I think that I am truly okay now.  It has been a very emotional couple of weeks with everything going on.  I know we will get through this.  I once again want to tell you that I am here for anything that needs to be done.  

You will not here about this situation again.  Thank you for understanding.  I put my total trust in you.  

John

Hi John,
I hope things are going well for you. Sorry I could not contact you earlier
- had been really busy wrapping up things. Thanks for stopping the other day
and inquiring about me. I have an H-1 visa and have 6 weeks to find a job
after which I will be required to leave the country.

I am attaching a copy of my resume for you to review. I would appreciate
greatly if you could go over it and offer any suggestions on how I can
improve my chances of finding a job.

Thanks,
Bilal

John,

As you are aware, there was some confusion on the 2 Peoples trades we did on 10/15/01.  We did not find out there could be a problem until yesterday, 15 days after the trade was input into the system.  I consider this unacceptable so I wanted to find out what happened to our processes internally.  

A person named Richard in the physical confirm area was the one that let Amy know the trade wasn't a financial trade but a physical trade.  I called him to ask him why it took 15 days to find this out.  He said that the deal was entered into as a financial deal so he didn't know about the trade until yesterday.  The person in charge of financial confirms is Diane Anderson and I called her to ask what happened.  She said she didn't know but would check into it.  She left me a message yesterday evening saying that for about 5 days in October they were shorthanded and they didn't confirm any financial trades.  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE,  especially in the situation we are currently in.  I haven't talked to her again but I wanted you to know about this.  Not to put any more problems on your desk, but this needs to be fixed.

Amy yesterday found a person at Peoples that knows the trades as we know them (financial).  So the trade is okay, but it could have been a $500,000 hit to Mike's book.

Please let me know if I can do anything.  Thanks.

John

That is great thank you.  I enjoyed you here.  Attached are Vladis files.  Call me when you get a chance so that I can go over them with you.  See you soon.

John

John
Your helpand teaching was greatly appreciated. Seeing how the market trades and how the EOL markets are maintained gives insight that is hard to recognise on the other side.
Please let us know if we canhelp withthe daily spreadsheet oerview- ifyou wouldn't mind forwarding on vladis page for richard and I to play with and adapt to what we need- that would be great and I can sendyou ours as we begin development
I hope you wouldn't mind if I call at the end of each day for a market recap and big flow information? Let me know what you think.
I will fedex a cheque for 400 on monday - is that cool?
Thanks again and good luck
Robyn

Carlos, give me a call today (Friday) when you get a chance.  853-6247.  Thanks.  John

I am sorry I haven't called you yet, I will talk to my wife about this.  Do you live in Montrose or near Montrose?  Maybe we could see the skeleton.  I am very interested in seeing what it looks like.  I will call you later.  Thanks.

John

John:

I'm used to calling you Johnny so please let me know your preference.

Anyway, I just wanted to follow up on our conversation about selling my 'bones.'    I'm going to scan a picture of her as soon as I can and forward that to you as well.    

I forgot to mention that the guys I bought it from were Oddfellows, which is a fraternal organization kind of like the Masons except for lower class types (their words).  If your'e not familiar with the Oddfellows, they made the news recently because they use skeleton's in their initiation rituals.  Very odd indeed.  They guys told me the bones are female....I don't know how to tell.

Talk soon, Peter

I haven't tested yet, but looks interesting.  Thanks.

John

There are two correlation calculators that are now available in O:\Research\Custom\CorrelMatrix\.

CorrelAnalysis.xls can basket up to 3 curves and calculates the correlation matrix on contracts with different expirations.  This is particularly helpful when the correlation matrix is needed for NYMEX+basis+index calculations.

CorrelVolCalc.xls calculates the correlation between two baskets.  It can basket up to 3 curves in each basket, so this calculator is also able to handle NYMEX+basis+index calculations.

These calculators have been reviewed by the Research Group, and we feel that they are accurate.  Please let me (x53240) or Paulo Issler (x56274) know if you find any problems or have any questions about these new tools.

Thanks,
Heather Johnson

"Here is the announcement: Reliant Energy Weather Risk Management Group has developed
Weather-sensitive Gas Load Indices ("WGLI"),  indices that measure national
or regional residential and commercial gas consumption during the heating
season. We believe the indices will provide valuable information for gas
traders as well as other market participants.  We plan to make a swap
market in the indices in the near future. We hope the WGLI swaps will
become a new financial tool to help you or your clients to better manage
their risks associated with the fluctuation of gas demand."

Greg,

I want to thank you so much for all you work on the trade blotter.  We are getting close here.  I put together a list of items to get the thing completely operational.  Below is the list and maybe we could talk today to discuss.  Thanks.

BLOTTER

 - rearrange the deal input screen
 - have Amy's sheet pull deals from access database
 - get Mike Maggi's computer set up for the access database
 - build a spreadsheet to take a snapshot of the blotter for Mike Maggi
 - set up a default month for the deal input screen (possibly an input on the spreadsheet)
 - have deal input screen popup on the screen that the spreadsheet is open in
 - on morning macro, include clear trades, clear charm, clear theta and clear recon numbers
 - separate price and vol on the Fetch Curves button
 - delete evening macro
 - add button for settle prices
 - add button to print position, pnl, options and swap pages (one button)
 - test multiple user input on the deal input spreadsheet

This list might look like alot, but I think most items will only take a few minutes to correct or change.  Let me know when you get a chance to sit down and talk about this.  Thanks.

John Griffith

Everything is going okay.  Dynegy has bought us out.  I think that if I was still in structuring then I might be worried, but I am trading natural gas options and the desk I work for has been very profitable.  I think that the natural gas and power trading floors are the main reason they bought us.  I would think they would like to keep things as they are on these desks, but you never know.  It will take 6-9 months before anything happens.

How are you doing?  I haven't heard from you in a while.  I would love to get together sometime.  My phone number is (713) 853-6247.  Call me sometime.

I guess you are working for Jeff Young now?  He used to be my boss.  How is the Europe group?  Are they still the same?  I am not for sure how your company is set up now.  

How is married life?  Is you wife in the US now?  Are you still in DC?

Talk to you soon.

John

Hey John,

Been following the latest development of your firm. Hope everything turns
out well in the end.

Would be fun to meet up for a drink some time. I'm in Houston on a regular

Thanks Greg, I think it fixed it.  Have a wonderful Thanksgiving and I will see you in 1 week.  Take care.
 
John

John,
 
I found the error.  It was a small logic error.
 
You can easily fix the problem if you go into the visual basic editor for the blotter file.  In the editor, you will see several modules listed on the left of the screen under the file.  You will need to edit the "Main_Query" module.
 
Once in the "Main_Query" module, you will need to search for the routine named "VerifyManualInputs".  The actual start of the routine looks like this:
 
Function VerifyManualInputs(FromDate As String, ToDate As String, PutCall As String, Lots As String, Strike As String, Price As String, CParty As String, sType As String) As Boolean

 
Within this routine, about 15-20 lines down, you should see the following two lines :
 
  If (isdate(FromDate) And isdate(ToDate)) Then
    If (ToDate < FromDate) Then
 
You need to change the second line to :
    
    If (CDate(ToDate) < CDate(FromDate)) Then
 
This should fix the problem.  The intent of the line is to prevent the "To Date" of a deal from being earlier than the "From Date".  In the original line of code, it does a TEXT based compare (like comparing is "ABC" < "DEF") instead of comparing the two values as DATES.  The modification I've laid out converts the from and to dates to date values before comparing.
 
I have tested the fix here and it should work fine.
 
I hope everything runs smooth for you next week.
 
Have a good Thanksgiving.
 
Greg

Hey sugar, I am still at work, just waiting on the IT people to set up a new folder in the UBS directory so that I can move all my files over.  Once that is done I will be leaving.  I will probably go directly to the Container Store.  Just let me know if that is okay.  

Are you getting hungry?  Do you want me to bring something?  Or do you want to eat at home.

Love you

The Pigs

Thanks,

Will this folder be set up today?

John

John,

On the O drive you will not be allowed to create folders, as this is a common drive -- so all folders are created by IT (it was this way at Enron). The exception to this rule is if you are the owner of the "main" folder ... which in this case you are.

So ... to make a long story short, YOU will be able to create folders under this path that we have requested, but your team members won't. They will have to request access to do so.

Again, it's the same process as we used at Enron

Site is on temporary string lighting, Aux Boiler, with Diesels running.
Investigation into trubine bearing damage and possible Unit Auxiliary
Transformer problems.

V.P. Russ Krieger came over the PA to say "Yahoo San Onofre!" for a job
well done in getting the outage done in 32 days (breaker to breaker, so to
speak). He went on to say that it is not known if the fault was related to
outage work, or if there will be an effect on our outage bonus. He said
we'll be of line for several weeks. I'd say at least that since our turbine
ground to a halt with no DC lube oil, and is still cooling with no jacking.

Please make certain that all physical positions are loaded correctly in NCD 
for term.  Have Patti Sullivan load all transport from the transport model in 
sitara so that the physical index positions will be recognized in NCD.   This 
would include SJ/Perm to Socal through OCT, Baja through MAR 20001 (100,000/d 
short PG&E Topock, 20,000/d long KRS, and 80,0000/d long Citygate), Kingsgate 
to Malin(Barry), Steve South's latest transport deal from Kingsgate/Stanfield 
to Malin, and any SJ to Waha transport.  

Anne, did you get a ticket from Steve on the transport mentioned above?  
King/Stan to Malin.

Also, let me know what the status of the transport deal from Kingsagte to 
Malin with Barry.  

Is the gd index for Perm position loading correctly in NCD for Apr-Oct?

Mo, please carry out the physical positions in NCD through Mar 2001. 

Thanks!

You all have done an excellent job with the gas daily products.  I have been 
asked to follow up with you guys to ensure that the products are rolled out 
on EOL at the same time each day and that they be managed in the same manner 
that you manage your cash products each day.  We have been asked to have one 
a day up at all times with a relatively tight two way and to provide market 
depth.  You may provide market depth, offset to last trade, or use last trade 
mid functions.  Let me know if you have any questions or concerns regarding 
this request.

Thanks,

We would like to schedule our trip to Cancun, Ritz Carlton for March 29, 
Thursday through Sunday.  It will be the trading group only, less Tori 
Kuykendall.  Please look into planning this trip.  You are the queen.

Sincerely,
Mike 

Would it be okay if we went ahead and rolled the socal and baja transport in 
sitara?  I would like to input the Socal transport through October 2001, San 
Juan to PG&E Topock and Mojave Topock (ask Janie for the allocation in 
April).  The Baja transport is through March 2002.  80000/d to Citygate and 
20,000 to KRS off-system.

This will really help me monitor my physical index exposure on the curve.  
Let's get together and discuss tomorrow.

Thanks,
Mike

I have asked Bob Badeer to help us research what the utilization rate of gas 
fired plants in the west was last year and what, if any, the impact of lower 
hydro and even warmer temps would mean to gas consumption in 2001.  We need 
to account for any political changes in air pollution credits this year that 
may increase gas consumption in 2001.  

Let's discuss in the afternoon. 3:30 meeting.

Grigsby

Can we update a west contact sheet?  I would like to have all traders and 
operations personnel listed.  Name, address, home phone, work phone, cell 
phone, and email.  Thank you so much.

The proxy price will be Gas Daily and Cantor Fitzgerald for Ca deliveries.  
How do we submit prices to Cantor Fitzgerald?  Anne, we will need to come up 
with  a cash report, much like our monthly index report for the 
publications.  Our data submitted will be under scrutiny at some point in the 
future.  It is important that all of our cash (one day) deals are reported 
accurately each day.

Thanks,

Please review the transport for next month and make certain that it is set up 
correctly for market prices.  Perm to Socal based on current spreads, SJ to 
Waha on EPNG, SJ to Waha on TW, etc.  The SJ to Waha spread is .20 for next 
month, does the transport work at these spreads?  

Please make the changes before prebid.

Also, please put in a good burn estimate for Citizens next month.  Please 
prepare to supply our socal pool with non-topock gas 100% next month.  

Thanks,
Mike

Please check the physical and fin index positions for prompt.  The index 
totals do not match the volumes in the Consindex tab in newcurrentday.

Thanks,
Mike

Sorry.  The topock curve should be marked as Socal flat.  Remember that we 
show the differentials in index spreads.  Please make certain that the pg&e 
topock curves are flat to socal in the future.  Can we run a report showing 
the curveshift spread between the two points since Jan 1, 2001?  Thanks.

Fixing the PG&E topock curve to Socal less .25 would only allocate more 
positive income to the transport.  The position at topock is short.  I am not 
sure if this is the problem from Friday.  Let's get together in the morning.  
Thanks for the email.

Matt,  

Please take a look at these spreadsheets and calc the gas usage by plant and

Barry,

I would like to focus our deal flow on Apr-Oct or 1 yr San Juan and Rockies 
supply.  Our fundamental investment is mainly in the rockies for 2001.  Let's 
get together with Mark Whitt, Paul Lucci, and others to set our supply goals 
for the mainly the apr-oct period.  I would like to work on buying every 
mmbtu of Opal, and all points included in the IF NW Rockies index.  Our goal 
should be to purchase at least 400,000/d of rockies supply and 500,000/d of 
San Juan Blanco and Bondad.  we have been buying these phys index points at 
+.01 in the rockies and +.005 in the San Juan.  You may need to coordinate 
with Fred Lagrosta's group initially to get all of their producer contacts.

Thanks,
Mike

Thank you for the summary.  Where can we find a detailed summary of the gas 
cost mechanism?  Are we confident that it is an average of all border points 
into CA?  If the real time price is capped at the least efficient generator, 
then what happens if this genertor can only buy Socal daily gas?  This 
avergae CA gas price will lead to a tighter heat rate for the generators, 
since the spread between Malin and Socal has reached $7.00 at times.

Thank you,
Mike Grigsby

I have been thinking about the cash book idea for group and I think we need 
to discuss this in more detail.  I would like to continue to use the physical 
for large prompt positions going forward.  I am afraid that the baseload 
volumes may not continue on their current trend if we break out the books.  
We need to discuss how the cash books would lay off risk.  i.e. Intra 
regional spreads with GD swap legs or spreads with other cash points and then 
booking out at gd mid to the internal counterparty.  Janie managing SJ and 
laying off risk on Steve's Opal.  I know that the cash books would be a good 
idea for dailies , but I am not sure how to do this without giving up the 
cash risk for baseload as well.  What are your thoughts?

I would also like to discuss the staffing issues.  Matt Smith and Susan Scott 
to analyst,  Jay to the ROX, etc.  It seems like Ken S. has shown more 
interest in the west fundies lately.  Should we keep his services?

The basis products need another book.  Who can we add to the mix?  I think 
that we should look into having Frank focus on prompt month only.  He has a 
great interest in cash and fundies and this should serve him well in managing 
tight two ways for all products on the prompt.  Keith can do term with 
another book.

Monique is going to take over the gd swaps for Kern, SJ, and Perm.  I will 
continue to manage the CA products.  This should allow us to provide tighter 
two ways across the west. I will continue to manage all index products and 
prompt month phys fixed price.

Operations needs more labor as well as an analyst or two to monitor flows.  
The analysts will monitor flows by price and hopefully find creative ways to 
nom the market.

EOL.  Keith has a great idea of opening up all products to the desk so that 
you may insert a bid or an offer inside of the manager's markets.  We should 
propose this to EOL.  This would allow for tighter markets on all products 
and prevent the desk from working markets through the brokers.

Ca cash products.  Let's call a meeting about how to offer more Socal 
physical products.  I would like to have PG&E topock and Socal Ehrenberg 
before the summer.  

Mike

Please activate all draft products in finswaps, and nontx phys and phys index 
(all terms) including restricted SJ.  Thank you very much.  Please call me

refernece Gas Daily publication, page three for the location of these 
indices.  We can simply insert the location of the electronic index where we 
currenly have the gas daily index survey language in the gd swaps in the

points.  El Paso Permian, El Paso , non-bondad, Kern River/Opal Plant, Socal 
Gas, large packages.  We will need to add electronic to the product title to 
differentiate between the two gd swaps.

Good morning.  With the energy crisis in California at this time, we will 
need to be extra careful with nominations at Socal and throughout the west to 
ensure that we continue to provide the excellent nomination service that we 
have been providing to our customers.  You guys are doing an excellent job 
and we understand that you are under quite a bit of pressure with limited 
staff.  Our contracts state that we must notify every customer of  pipeline 
allocations 12 hours in advance.  We all know that this can be almost 
impossible on EPNG, but because of the current price levels at Socal and the 
basins, Enron needs to call each customer and notify them of their cuts with 
an explanation of the pipeline cuts each day to avoid any potential 
penalties.  We also need to document when the call was made.  In regards to 
the ATM nominations on Socal (ones that we can't monitor), Enron will be 
requesting full pipeline summaries of the nominations from our 
counterparties.  Please try to think of any nomination gaming that may take 
place at these historical levels.  We need to remember that our 
counterparties may not act as they have in the past due to the market price 
implications on their P&L.  We should not rely on prior business conduct in 
regards to "standard epng allocations" when dealing with our customers.  I 
would expect that the market is going to overreact to any cuts that may be 
above the "pipeline average".

Let's discuss how we are going to monitor the flows of nominations out of our 
control.  How do we prevent collusion with respect to the socal nominations 
that we can't see?  Are there package numbers on each baseload contract to 
ensure that they don't simply reshuffle gas according to price? Let me know 
which companies are not providing Enron with timely allocation reports at 
Socal and I will call their senior trader to discuss getting this operational 
information sooner.

Sincerely,

Mike

Anne,

We need to delete the two trades listed under rockies that are priced 13.90 
and 14.00.  Please move these trades to Sumas and resend the data to the

you make the changes.

The PG&E basis position in TDS does not match the FEB/MAR position.  The Baja 
spread was executed as a NOV-MAR position months ago. The only real changes 
were to Socal basis over time. There is no telling when this might have 
changed in error.  Will you please research the position to see when this 
position was reduced.  I am guessing that a park and loan was executed by 
Frank Ermis at some point and the basis risk was allocated to GD New by 
mistake.

Thanks,

Thank you.  Can you also address the question about gda physical volumes not 
showing up in my position manager?  Let me know.

Mike

Are we confident that the gda priced positions are not being represented in 
my newcurrentday position sheet?  I know that Phillips triggered their 
volumes back to GDA equivalent and that Matt Lenhart bought some GDA malin 
gas.  How do we keep these from showing up in the physical risk?

Mike

The position sheet from yesterday afternoon, close of business, is quite 
different than the position posted in newcuurentday for 11/29.  What do you 
think the difference is?  The SJ, Perm, and Socal don't match.  Are we 
booking them correctly.  Let me know.  

Ask Anne to reconcile each day with comments on the prompt tab.

Thanks,
Mike 

We will need to discuss how to adjust physical risk to match the flow 
constraints on EPNG.  The currrent capacity cuts in the SJ and Socal topock 
delivery points are 50%.  I would like my P&L to show this risk.  Please find 
a way to adjust the positions according to a daily flow curve that can be set 
in newcurrentday by either myself or Monique.  

Also, We will need to set up a new physical curve for Mojave Topock.  Our 
transport is currently being reallocated by EPNG for deliveries to Mojave 
instead of Socal topock.  I would like to show the transport on EPNG value as 
SJ plus cost to Mojave and have the value roll out each month, if any.  The 
risk is showing the value of SJ to Socal topock (currently wide spreads for 
2001) on the transport when it actually has less value delivering to Mojave 
topock.

Sincerely,
Mike

Hey guys.  Let's try this.  Take the data from 2000 and change the 
following.  Take Keystone West volumes to 850,000/d rateably, then add the 
new gen numbers posted below.  You will need to add this demand to the EOC S 
ML demand numbers (Is Salmayuca included in this number?).  We should use the 
2000 waha west volumes for now.  You should end up with reduced ehrenberg 
volumes for the reduction in Keystone west volumes and the addition of New 
Gen demand.  Run the storage balance at 2000 Socal in this scenario.  We will 
then plug forward with waha west volumes to balance Socal in 2001.  Also, add 
columns to adjust (90%, 60%, 50%, etc) the burns for new gen in SW.  We 
should then look to adjusting socal demand down for the high hydro/increased 
NW imports to CA scenario that could happen.  Use the SP-15 2000 gen numbers 
and then back out the avg of 1999 and 2000 power imports.  I would like to 
avoid averaging 1999 and 2000 socal gas demand. Use a 10,000 heat rate to 
reduce gas demand.  Have Jay adjust EOC demand for normal weather.  We may 
have to refer to the load sensitivity data from west power to reduce the SW 
electric loads and then back out of gen numbers using a 10,000 heat rate.  We 
will then be exposed to EPNG and the OPS increasing Keystone west volumes 
between now and next summer - run the 2001 with this possibility as well.  
Take Key West to 1.1 bcf.  Let me know where my errors in approach may be.

This should give us a picture of the Socal deliverability for 2001.

Thanks,
Mike   

This is the data that we will use to build our Socal growth estimates.   Take 
a look at the file and then we can discuss how to combine this with current 
pipeline capacity and future expansions.

As noted in my  last e-mail, the Ray Nixon expansion project in Colorado had 
the incorrect start date.  My last report showed an online date of May 2001; 
the actual anticipated online date is May 2003.
 
The following list ranks the quality and quantity of information that I have 
access to in the WSCC:

 1) CA - siting office, plant contacts
 2) PNW - siting offices, plant contacts
 3) DSW - plant contacts, 1 siting office for Maricopa County Arizona.
 4) Colorado - Integrated Resource Plan

If anyone has additional information regarding new generation in the Desert 
Southwest or Colorado, such as plant phone numbers or contacts, I would 
greatly appreciate receiving this contact information.

I like this report.  Can it be put into the same format as the other "access" 
reports?  Thanks for all of your work on this project.  You are doing a great 
job.

Dear Dan,

Thank you for contacting me, but I am quite content with my current 
opportunities at Enron.  Thank you so much for your interest.  

Sincerely,

Ina, I can't seem to find the expense deposit for the SW Bell charges in my 
account.  Will you please contact them again and ask them for a copy of the 
check?  Thank you so much.

Mike

Thank you very much.

Mike Grigsby

Please sweep the products in phys non-tx<1 month and phys index non TX<1 
month.  Also, i need access to view restricted products in product manager 
for non-tx phys forward and index<1 month.

Thanks,
Mike

Thanks. It looks like the phys transport volumes were added to socal and 
citygate, but could you add all of the transport model positions to the 
physindex tab.  PG&E topock, san juan, mojave, krs, etc.

Gracias,
Mike

 - Olivia Newton John - Physical.mp3

Let's plan on mailing this out to the US customers only.    Call me today to 
discuss the eol new version.

Thanks,
Mike

After continuing to play musical chairs with the west eol products, I think 
we have decided on a plan.  Keith and Frank will handle the prompt and term 
basis.  This includes the monthly basis, daily basis, and gd index for SJ, 
ROX, Scal, CG, and Malin.   They will make certain that the gd index products 
are out there for all terms.  Cary Metz is managing the Perm products.

I will handle the prompt month physical fixed price and index for all of the 
index points.  The term physical index will be coming soon.

The rest of the group will continue to manage their cash index points for the 
next day trading, while adding the BOM physical with a basis link to 
Monique's GD BOM products.  I would like to get the cash products out on eol 
by 7:15 each morning.  The early info will come in handy as we approach 
winter.  Let me know what you think.   Steve and Matt have started a pilot 
program in the NW for rolling out their next day cash products after 11:00 am 
each day.  We will look into rolling out the SW in the future.

We are in the process of sending out the "odd lot" notice to our customers 
regarding all products on eol.  We will change our product minimum to one 
mmbtu in the next week.  You may want to discuss this with your direct 
customers before the mailout.    

With the addition of Olivia Newton-John to my Scour selection, it is no 
secret that we have a new commitment to physical in the west.  If you review 
your customer contact sheet and discover an old customer that we haven't 
contacted in some time, then call them and visit.  We will be using EOL and 
the brokers for physical volumes, but nothing beats the direct phone call for 
the baseload phys.

Thanks,

Mike 

  

Nice job on the postcard.  I will get you an answer on the mailout tomorrow 
morning.  Let me know if you hear anything from EOL regarding the new version.

Thanks,
Mike Grigsby

The Gas Daily basis issue should be worked out between your desk and the 
monthly basis desk.  We are making markets on GD basis for every term and 
index point.  This creates a nice market for term gd index.  Let us know how 
you guys would like to cover the gd basis with us.  The real opportunity for 
gd basis is at socal, where the monthly index is so unreliable.

Mike

We will launch as soon as we get the mailout to our customers.

Mike

Great. Can you come to trading floor around 11:30 am on Wednesday?  I am 
located at 3210C.

Let's begin rolling out the cash products at 7:15 am.  We should also get 
back to the cash strategy of the desk each morning.  Let's start testing the 
market, find the support and resistance each day.  It would be nice to have 
EOL change the stack manager so that we can switch a product from manage 
market depth to last trade is mid with the click of a button, and not go 
through the product properties.  I'll call them tomorrow.

Let's also decide on a time to close the products each morning.  We want to 
send the message of reliability, but also allow our Ops group to balance and 
nom.  I want to begin trading the next day cash by 11:01 am every day.  This 
would stay active until 4:00.

The push is for PHYSICAL.  Our edge over the market will be phys.  From risk 
to the ability to nominate and invoice, the other platforms will never see it 
coming. What are the chances that ICE and espeed will deal with el paso 
flows?  If information is the reason for EOL, then this will provide it.  It 
all seems so simple - Fixed priced physical, just when you thought it was old 
economy.  The reliable indices to big position trading to EOL market share, 
all benefit under the new mantra.

Hello.  The west gas desk would like to send a mailout to our EOL customers 
regarding the new opportunity to trade "odd lots" on every physical product.  
EOL has been instrumental in providing liquidity to previously illiquid 
physical delivery points in the west for standard volumes of 5000 mmbtu/d and 
greater, but we would like to notify our customers that EOL will now 
accommodate odd size lots, in 1 mmbtu increments.  This will allow us to 
trade the "non-standard" volumes with all of the market.

Do we have a creative team that might be able to assist us in our efforts?  
We were thinking about a one page mailout with a clear message.  We would 
like it to be very upbeat and funny.  

Thank you for your assistance.  I can be reached at x37031.

Will be happy to help this group.  They'll need to agree to the following:

1.  They pay for the cost (to be determined depending on the quality of the 
mailing)
2.  They provide a mailing list with following separate columns:
First name
Last Name
Company Name
Address
City
State
Zip
3.  Give us a draft of the text for the mailing
4.  Give us 5 working days to get it out.  (we will try to do it faster, but 
it depends on several factors)

Anne,

After NX1 going forward, I would like to load my final positions in the 
LIQBasis tab in NCD.  The positions will include basis, physindex and gd 
index positions.  We can then run settlement index scenarios to see what my 
risk will be to index postings.  This will be a huge benefit.

Gracias,
Mike

Please read the following email from EOL.  I have asked them to assist the 
West desk in mailing out an ad to all of our customers (utilities, producers, 
industrials, and some IPPs) notifying them of our plan to reduce the minimum 
volume accepted on all of our EOL products.  Start thinking of which 
customers should be on the list and try to think of a creative way to present 
this to our customers.  EOL has asked us to provide them with the text of our 
message.

Also, let's go ahead and reduce the min volume on our products (primarily all 
phys and gas dailies) this week.  We are attempting to capture all of the odd 
lot flow in the market.  I would see this service as a clear advantage over 
the other web platforms.  

Let's get together on Friday afternoon at Ninfa's to discuss our ideas.

Thank you very much.

Mike

Will you please get me access to manage the SJ physical product? I would like 
to link it for prompt month information.

Thanks,
Mike

Please add PG&E citygate GD/D -  HHub GD (basis) to the database.  Also, I 
would like to check on the status of the Baja spread product.  Please sweep

Thank you for contacting me.  The new baby is doing great.  I would like to 
add you guys to the box if you are interested.  I would also like to have 
your west physical guys on my box.  It has been brought to my attention that 
APB has great fixed price physical flow.  If you are not aware, I am running 
the physical desk as well.  Let everyone know that it will based on one 
condition - All numbers or no numbers.  We do not wish to participate in a 
closed market.

We need to run regression on this load profile for Palo Alto.  We should back 
out the industrial class and run their residential load.  Can you find 
reliable weather for Palo Alto?  Kim Ward is signing a full requirements deal 
with Palo on PG&E.

Thanks,
Mike
Let me know if you need anything else or if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Mo,

Are your reports still available for EOL that you created months ago?  I 
would like to turn them over to the fundies group ( Matt Smith) tomorrow.

Mike

Call me to discuss my discussions with the guy in charge of steel.  The guy 
was most disturbing.  There will not be any opportunity to contact this guy 
in the near future.

Grigs

Will you transfer all of the existing SJ 100% flow deals to the new curve?  
Please coordinate with the desk to identify all deals executed prior to the 
new curve being created.

Thanks,
Mike

The box will be turned on Wednesday.  Thanks for the email regarding my 
baby.  Talk to you in the morning.

Sincerely,

Mike Grigsby

Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner.  Thank you for the invite the other 
day.  I just had my second child, so I am little busy.  We will be turning on 
the box with natsource gas daily today.  I apologize for the inconvenience.  
The information reported internally warranted suspending business with 
Natsource for a few days.  I am not interested in hearing your side of the 
story.  Business as usual here forward.

Sincerely,

Dear Tom,

I am glad you like the website.  When you go into the personalize myquotes 
filter, select the commodity, region, and products.  You will need to scroll 
down the products list and select the US GAS phys index points of interest to 
you.  Please call me if you have any problems.  Your filter can then be 
sorted by right clicking on the filter at the column heading.  You can sort 
by five different groupings.  

Sincerely,

Dear Tom, 

Enron would be interested in getting together with other trading partners to 
discuss listing other index points at the Socal border.  I think the market 
requires other postings to reflect the fundamental changes in the market with 
respect to transportation constraints.  The market has clearly seen a 
divergence in the summer spreads between PG&E and Socal interconnects.  The 
marginal generation load in SP-15 and Southern California this summer has 
proven that Socal Gas is short delivered gas and is incapable of meeting 
daily demand with flowing supplies, and will be incapable of injecting gas 
during these months.  Because of this, supply being transported from the 
Southwest supply basins can only find a home going into PG&E.  This places 
downward pressure on PG&E Topock gas and upward pressure on Socal Topock 
gas.  Remember, Socal is an island, not because of the delivered capacity to 
the border via EPNG and TW, but because of the limited capacity of Socal's 
interconnects.  Demand exceeds the supply interconnect capacity.   

There is also a divergence between Ehrenberg and Topock because of 
liquidity.  Topock is a more liquid market because of the upstream transport 
contracts on EPNG and downstream buying patterns of certain Socal markets. 
The market is more diversified at Topock than Ehrenberg.  The overwhelming 
demand pressure on Socal gets exposed at Topock.  Although Ehrenberg is the 
marginal point for gas into Socal, there is more of an imbalance in upstream 
capacity (EPNG and TW) to downstream capacity (Socal Topock 545,000/d) at 
Socal Topock than at Ehrenberg.  The Socal Ehrenberg interconnect has 1.1 bcf 
of capacity and is primarily sourced by one market transporter.  Ehrenberg 
simply gets placed at "market prices" because of varying objectives.  One 
transporter may place gas to larger buyers to ensure flows, while smaller 
buyers on Socal may not approach this transporter for supplies.  This 
illiquidity has led to a spread existing between Topock and Ehrenberg. 

Picture  the market, San Juan gas is trading well below the Permian and Waha 
basins, which happen to be the marginal supply points for the west.  Because 
of the of the limited capacity going into Socal Topock, every transporter on 
EPNG and TW wants to fill their contracts with San Juan gas first.  These 
molecules compete for Buyers at a limited delivery interconnect. Likewise, 
all Buyers reach out for supply coming through a limited delivery 
interconnect (Topock). The San Juan then trys to find an outlet going east on 
the SJ east leg of EPNG.  This transport leg simply displaces Permian gas 
going into Plains North and allows Permian gas to head west to Ehrenberg on 
the EPNG south mainline.  While the Socal market peaks in the summer, so does 
the EOC demand.  Permian west (Keystone West meter)  cannot satisfy both the 
EOC demand and the Socal demand.  So for the first time ever, we saw EPNG 
Waha West at maximum capacity to source transport contracts on the EPNG south 
mainline.  This tells the entire story.  When demand exceeds all available 
historical supply points, and begins to reach to Waha to meet Ehrenberg 
demand, you have a paradigm shift.   This eliminates any correlation that may 
have existed between the supply basins and the market area.  When Keystone 
West reaches maximum capacity, the rule of market spreads not exceeding the 
max rate transport rate then dies a fast death.  There is simply no available 
capacity at the Keystone West meter to allow a shipper to buy max rate 
transport on EPNG and ship it to Socal.  If you asked the market what the 
maximum interconnect capacity at Keystone West is, 9 out of 10 would not 
know.  This leads to blaming market participants for wide spreads that are 
above historical levels.  It is like Al Gore blaming "big oil companies" for 
the high prices of gas, when all refineries are at maximum capacity.  There 
simply isn't the capacity to meet demand.  The supply exists, but there isn't 
enough refining capacity available to meet demand.  Fundamentals rule the 
market in all cases.

I would like to propose the following index points for the Southern 
California border.  The market would  be better served with supply being 
included in these index points.  One, Socal CA production/Socal storage/EPNG 
Ehrenberg, Two, Topock TW and EPNG, Three, KRS/Wheeler Ridge.  The market 
will be experiencing more changes with respect to the Socal restructuring in 
the future.  We will then address the different interconnects and propose an 
index for the Socal citygate as well. 

Call me on Monday to discuss the Enron Online download.

I need to add my son, Clark Watson, to my beneficiary list for medical, etc.  
Please let me know what I need to do to complete this task.  

Thank you,
Mike

Tom,

See the email below for the ID and password.

Call me on Monday to discuss the download process, if you should have any 
questions.  You will log into www.enrononline.com and I think you will need 
to download shockwave media (the site should walk you through this process).  
Once you have typed in the ID and password, you will then have the option of 
setting up a personalized quote page.  Also, call me about where to see our 
posted daily indices each day on the website.  Enron releases the weighted 
average of all gas traded at each physical point every day.

Thanks,

Anne,

I would like to check the index positions in the physindex tab in NCD.  
Please have all of the positions in the BasisTransport tab, section transport 
model, added to the phys index position totals.  Please look at the PG&E CG 
positions for May-Oct, I added the transport positions already.  I would like 
to add a KRS row in the physindex summary to account for the 20000/d 
transport that we have.  Also, please have the new transport index positions 
at Socal that we are booking tomorrow included in the new KRS column in the 
physindex tab.  We can review in the afternoon.

You are doing a great job.  I am sorry that I have not had a chance to thank 
you recently.  The market is distracting me.

Sincerely,
Mike

I received an email this morning regarding the reports viewer.  I agree with 
restriciting the access to these sensitive reports, but I don't agree with 
removing myself from those allowed to review positions.  I not only run one 
of the largest financial books on the floor, but I also manage the West 
physical book.  Phillip Allen passed on the IM WEST physical book to me two 
months ago.  While Phillip acts as manager of the sub books in the west, I am 
managing all physical positions.

Mike Grigsby  

Do I not have access to the reports?  Please let me know.

Thank you for all of the emails.  The baby is doing great.

Mike

Your replies are brief and extremely vague.  I will assume that you are not 
interested.  

Thanks,
Mike Grigsby

Thanks for the update.  Try to stay flat on all gas dailies tomorrow.  Our 
length is good for now.  Let's stay flat for now in the oct index. I will be 
working from home in the morning.  Please have Matt email the ops reports to 
my lotus.  Also, please have Patti email her sheets also - the pipeline 
summary and flow reports.

Download the hearme.com software and login on my pc to use the mic, or the 
headset in one of the drawers on the right.  Tell Philip that I will be using 
hearme.com.

Mike

Steve,

Start buying N-M citygate index this week.  Pay as much as necessary to get 
resonable size.  I am thinking 100,000/d for the winter.

Grigsby

keep buying N-M socal gd index up to plus .04.  I will buy as much as they 
want to sell.  talk to amerex. 

Mike

Can you put a tab together for our phys index positions NOV-MAR?  Thanks

Mike

Let's continue to buy Socal  for the rest of the month.  I would like to sell 
Rockies, and remian neutral on Permian and San Juan, unless it looks like the 
maint on washington ranch will have a bullish effecst on the basins.  I will 
leave it up to you to determine.  I will call later.

Mike

Let's continue to go long sep swing on Socal.  I am willing to as long as we 
can each day.  The plan of getting short for OCT bidweek no longer applies 
because of reduced basis risk in OCT basis.

Thanks,
Grigsby

Please make the return on Sunday earlier.  Before 12:00 would be great.

Thanks,
Mike

When do we expect to hear back from NGI on the sep index?  

Grigsby

Can we create a San Juan phys for Oct bidweek?  What did we decide with this 
product - swing only?  If we do, I would like to link it to the basis plus 
nymex, or to the fixed price gas daily (fixed price gas daily will be rolled 
out during bidweek this month because of our risk in gd basis going 
forward).  I want to roll the Inside Ferc phys points out during bidweek 7-4, 
as defined by Inside Ferc, last trade is mid.  The NGI index points will be 
out 7 to 4 during bidweek, as defined by NGI.  

We will plan on sending the data to both index publications.  Time open to 
market, time of actual trade, counterparty, price, etc.  This will be 
considered their last opportunity to be accurate or we will decline to 
participate until their numbers are audited.

Thanks,
Mike

Please contact Keith Holst if you should have any questions regarding the new 
spread products.  Please let him know when they are completed.  I will be out 
of the office until Wednesday.  Thank you very much.

Mike Grigsby

I am sure that you are aware of the move to daily basis from monthly.  The 
west desk will be trying to phase out monthly for daily in the next month.  
We have created term gd basis vs. the HHub gd through apr-oct 01 for all 
index points.  

Grigsby  

I created the term gd basis products for waha, perm, sj, opal, and malin this 
weekend.  Call Dale or Melba to activate.  Keith and I briefly discussed how 
we would handle the new responsibility.  I am fine with managing the prompt 
month gd basis, while you guys manage the term.  I will be back in the office 
this week and we can talk about the products.  Would we handle the monthly 
the same way?  When do we plan to phase the monthly out?  Have Phillip manage 
the perm and waha basis until I return.  

Dale is also working on the Baja and Redwood on/off system spreads.  We can 
roll these out for all terms as well.

See you this week.

Grigsby

Greg,

Are you interested in discussing opportunities with E*steel at another 
time?   I would like to have Mr. Belew call you to set up an appointment in 
the near future.  Let me know what your objective is with Enron Networks, and 
if you are pursuing the same online platform growth in steel that we are in 
natural gas.  Do you see opportunities in trading steel products as a 
commodity at some point, and if so, will Enron be active in making markets 
not only on EOL, but on other platforms?  

I appreciate your taking the time to entertain their questions.  Thank you 
for your assistance.

sincerely,

Greg,

I wanted to forward this letter to you that I received from a good friend of 
mine who is interested in discussing global steel trading oppotunities with

Mike,

As per our conversation, I would appreciate your help to arrange a short
meeting with executives from Enron Networks and a group from our company.

e-STEEL (www.e-steel.com) has become the preferred marketplace as well as
the recognized technological and collaborative commerce leader for the
$800billion global steel market. We have financial backing from Goldman
Sachs and Kleiner Perkins and have alliance contracts with companies
throughout the steel supply chain, including U.S. Steel and Ford Motor
Company . Because we consider Enron another leader in the development of
electronic marketplaces, we feel that there may be areas for mutual
cooperation. The purpose of our meeting is strictly exploratory.

Our group will consist of myself and Mr. Russ Carleson (Vice President,
Sales) from our headquarters in New York. We would like to propose a lunch
meeting next Thursday, September 14th, if possible. I will call you this
week to follow up.

Thanks,

Chase Belew

I was out yesterday to become a father and Courtney was rescheduled for 
Monday.  I will call Bruce Garner this morning.  His number is 713-345-7321.  
I will let you know when the baby finally comes.

Grigsby 

Please make a few minor changes to the Scal product.  I would like it read 
GD/D SCal - HHUB.  I apologize about the mistake, but SCAL is a premium to 
HHUB.  We also need to take a look at the description, fixed and floating.

Thanks,

Bruce, 

I work with Phillip Allen in West Gas Trading and he talked to Greg Piper 
about the letter attached below, and Greg told us to forward it to you.    
Mr. Chase Belew and Mr. Carleson, with E*Steel, would like to meet with you 
to discuss market opportunities in the global steel market.   I would like to 
have Mr. Belew call you to set up a time to meet with you.  Would this be a 
problem?  Please call me to discuss.

Please set up the product as Gas Daily Basis GD/D HHUB - SCAL.  We will use 
this until we decide to create a subgroup of daily basis products.  Thank you 
for setting this up today.

Mike Grigsby

Dale,  

Will you please create the following products for me when you get the 
chance?  I would like to have GD/D HHUB vs EP San Juan,  GD/D HHUB vs. EP 
Permian, GD/D HHUB vs. Malin, and  GD/D HHUB vs. Kern/Opal.  These will look 
like the GD/D HHUB vs. SCal that we currently have in EOL.

Also, Can I please create three Gas Daily basis products. GD/D BAJA spread - 
This spread will simply be the GD/D SCAL vs. PG&E Citygate. 
The GD/D Redwood off-system spread - GD/D Malin vs. SCal.  The GD/D Redwood 
on-system spread -   GD/D Malin vs. PG&E Citygate.

Call me to discuss.  Thank you.

That was the main factor.  The cash market also had a difficult time trading 
higher than 14.50.  The basis curve was on its way to contango, when it has 
lived in backwardation for some time.  This created resistance on the basis 
curve.  The PG&E announcement pushed it over the edge.  Market is back up 
today on stronger cash and the socal edison announcement.

Paige & Mark,

I went to Mike Grigsby's house to setup the DSL and Nortel connection but was 
unsuccessful.  When I tried to log in to CORP I got an error that no domain 
server was able to validate my password.  I went in and released the IP but 
got an error when trying to renew.  I verified that the card was installed 
correctly and that network properties were correct.  I then plugged straight 
into DSL and bypassed the Nortel box thinking that I could at least get that 
to work and then VPN into Enron.  That also did not work.  I spoke to SWB 
tech support for almost an hour trying some various things but was 
unsuccessful in those as well.  I also spoke to Mark Scott via telephone.

I was unable to ping the gateway...nor anything for that matter which led me 
to believe that there was something wrong with the line.  SWB said they were 
going to do some line testing from their end and would get back with Mike.  
At this point I would recommend sending someone out from Mark Scott's team 
that is more familiar with these setups than I am.  I do think it would be a 
good idea from someone from TSG to accompany them if they are able to arrange 
a time and then disseminate that information to the rest of the team.  

Regards,
KG

Thank you.  Please let me know what you guys plan to do.  I can meet someone 
at the house this afternoon.  Call me at x37031.

   , , -- (04-05) 18:08 PDT Here is the text of Gov. Gray Davis' televised
speech on energy Thursday, as prepared for delivery:
   "Good evening. I'm speaking to you tonight from Sacramento on the most
difficult issue facing California: our energy crisis.
   "Simply stated, we have two problems: supply is too low and costs are too
high. Both result from the flawed deregulation scheme created in 1996. But
no matter how we got into this mess, you hired me to solve problems. And
that's what I'm doing.
   "The only long-term solution is to build more power plants. We must also
cut back on consumption and stabilize the utilities. But prices won't fall
and supply won't be truly reliable until we generate more power than we
consume.
   "Yet in the 12 years before I took office, not a single major power plant
was built in California. Not one. Since I became governor, we've licensed
12 major power plants. Ten more are in the pipeline. And we're doing this
without weakening our commitment to clean air and clean water.
   "Deregulation required the utilities to sell off many of their power
plants to independent generating companies. The generators are free to
charge whatever they want because they're governed only by federal
regulators who refuse to control wholesale energy prices.
   "This past winter, the prices charged by the generators shot through the
roof, driving the utilities to the brink of bankruptcy.
   "In January, with the feds still refusing to do their job, California
stepped in to purchase the power the utilities could no longer afford to
buy. We didn't take over to save the utilities. We took over to keep the
power on and the economy strong. That's not all:
   -- We also negotiated long-term contracts for electricity at vastly lower
prices.
   -- I used my emergency powers to seize control of low-cost power contracts
the utilities were about to forfeit to the generators.
   -- We began negotiations to buy the utilities' transmission system.
   -- We cut red tape and offered cash incentives to speed up construction of
power plants.
   -- We're launching an $800 million conservation program.
   -- We're moving to establish a public power authority to build more power.
If the private sector fails to build all the plants California needs,
we'll build them ourselves.
   -- And because I share your concern that the generators are ripping us
off, we're using every legal remedy to root out and punish illegal
conduct.
   "We can't fix 12 years of inaction overnight. But we're making real
progress.
   "Now, as you know, I have fought tooth and nail against raising rates.
It's become increasingly clear, however, that with rising natural gas
prices, the feds' failure to control costs, and the state's lack of
supply, that some rate increases are needed to keep our lights on and our
economy strong.
   "But I remain committed to protecting average Californians from massive
rate hikes. So I'm urging the Public Utilities Commission to adopt a plan
that will protect average consumers, reward those who conserve and
motivate the biggest users to cut back.
   "Under my proposal, more than half of you won't pay a penny more. For the
rest, the average increase will be 26 1/2 percent. For many of that group,
rates will rise only about 10 percent. The heaviest users will see their
rates rise 34 1/2 percent on average. That includes business paying their
share. This is in addition to the 9 percent surcharge we've all been
paying since last winter.
   "But all Californians can reduce their bills through conservation.
   "Here's the point: The more you use, the more you pay. The more you
conserve, the more you save. Conservation is our best short-term weapon
against blackouts and price-gouging. By flexing your power, you'll help
secure our energy future.
   "Unlike the PUC, my plan includes funds to restore the utilities to
financial stability -- if they agree to three main conditions:
   "They must provide low-cost regulated power to the state for 10 years.
Agree to sell us their transmission system. And dismiss their lawsuits
seeking to double your electricity rates.
   "My proposal raises rates fairly, assures us of long-term power,
stabilizes the utilities and promotes conservation.
   "Our emphasis on conservation is critical. In order to make it through the
summer, we must cut demand by at least 10 percent.
   "Already we've launched programs to cut back commercial lighting, and
reduce consumption in office buildings, schools and government facilities.
   "Friends, we have a power shortage but we are far from powerless. We are
34 million strong and if each of us does our part, we can minimize
disruptions and get through the summer. We are Californians. We've
withstood earthquakes, floods, fires, and droughts.
   "Yes, this mess is man-made, but with your help and God's blessing, we'll
get through this as well.
   "Thank you and good night."

	
	

	
	

	
	

Jay and Matt,

We should get together and build a gas consumption model for the new 
generation in the west.  We should identify the delivery point and then 
continue to monitor their status.  This will provide us with more information 
behind our Socal/Rockies spread. 

Thanks,

Grigsby

We need to talk about the contract language for Holly Sugar.  Please see Kim 
Ward about some of the language we have used for full-req customers on PG&E.

Thanks,
Mike

Please call me.  I believe I ordered a bloomberg machine only.  Does it some 
with its own operating system or is it offered through the network?  Please 
let me know before coming to install.  I already have two computers.

Thanks,
Mike

We now have a PG&E topock basis product on EOL.  The curve is currenlty 
mapped to Socal with the differential to Socal being calculated in the 
physical index curve.  Let's work on setting up this curve on Tuesday so that 
it shows the accurate value for fin deals.  We can have the curve calc off of 
a discount to citygate in Keith's spreadsheet.

Mike

Anne,

Can we add PG&E Topock and Mojave Topock index points to the NCD locations?  
I think we discussed that they can't be added because of their association 
with Socal curves.  Let me know.

Also, can we add the new rockies index locations to the NCD sheet?  It would 
be nice to see these locations broken out in detail.

Mike

We need to make certain that the transport  for Pasdena is booked properly in 
sitara.  I am taking a flash to actual hit on P&L because of our inability to 
book this deal properly.  I need the transport booked in sitara at index to 
index, and then book the fixed cost payed to Pasadena in an index minus sale 
to them at the border.  Please run a minibook of the transaction thru the 
remaining term and let me review it.  Please let me know when this has been 
fixed.  

Kim, what is the cost of the transport for the month of May?  Did we roll the 
cost from April?  Also, did we change the index in the San Juan to Inside 
Ferc?

Thanks, 

Mike

Jay, what are we doing with questar positions?  Are you managing this index 
point? I have an April position and Mark Whitt is working on a term deal.

Thanks,
Mike

Please write up a ticket transferring my CIG and WIC April physical positions 
to IM denver.  I will be selling CIG index to Jay at CIG index flat and 
buying the 2000/d at CIG index minus .03.  Also, run a report of all my term 
index positions at CIG and WIC for the summer, so that we can transfer these 
to Jay as well.

Thanks,
Mike

The Rockies index language looks good.  We need to separate the southern 
border PG&E trades from the southern border socal and Socal trades.  All 
Socal trades (except KRS, which we have none at this time) go under Socal and 
southern border - socal wacogs, while the PG&E topock/southern border - PG&E 
trades go under the Southern border, PG&E wacog.  Please make the change to 
the sheet and forward a copy to me before emailing.

Thanks,
Mike

The information is correct.  Please settle with the customer.

Thanks,
Mike

Anne,

We will need to add a message to the email that we send out to the 
publications this bidweek.  Let's get together to discuss the text.  We have 
added new products that will need to be matched with their respective Index 
postings.

Thanks,

Ken called yesterday and we bought 5000/d april from him at 4.87.  He said it 
could be either Milagro or El Paso SJ.  Please call him and confirm the

There is another problem on the invoice.  According to the PG&E
transportation billing Newark Sierra Paperboard used 72758 mmbtu and
California Paperboard used 14650 mmbtu.  The total mmbtu invoiced should

I made some big changes to the index curves tonight.  Please run a new P&L 
early in the morning in order to estimate what the changes in book value will 
be.  I will need to let John Lavorado know about the changes to the curves 
before we decide to book these tomorrow.   Please run a report from the 
transport model so that I may see the changes to the delivery points.

Thanks,
Mike

Please review the transport positions in sitara for next month.  We should 
have the Baja transport included.  100,000 short for PG&E topock, 80,000 long 
Citygate, and 20,000 long KRS.  The sj to socal transport should be broken 
out to like 24,000 topock, 14,000 mojave, and the balance to pg&e topock.  
Also, please check on the kingsgate to malin and stanfield to malin for next 
month.  What about sj to waha?

Patti, please run a report showing all of the sitara transport deals.  Thank 
you!

Mike

Phillip,

Courtney needs me to watch the boys on Thursday in order to get organized 
before we leave for Italy.  I can be reached on my cell phone 713-408-6256.  
Please have Anne update the newcurrentday sheet in order to manage my 
position.  Please call me with any pertinent market information.  I will see 
you Friday.  Thanks for the help.

Thanks,
Mike

Can we scrub the transport model P&L for yesterday?  Did the transport being 
switched to PG&E topock show any losses?  Let me know the breakdown.

Thanks,
Mike

Is the Baja for April transport in sitara?  Please let me know.

Thanks,
MIke

Please activate all index producst in section 1125.  Non Texas phys index 
less than one year.  PG&E, SOCAL, and Socal Ehrenberg.

Thanks,
Mike

Melba,

Will you please take a look at the term non-texas index products greater than 
one year and activate them?  The section is numbered (1126) in product 
manager.

Thanks,
Mike

Steve,

Let's discuss all of your new rox products for EOL.  I would like to know 
which products to roll out on EOL for April bidweek.  I would also like to 
discuss creating a south of Muddy Creek product for Kern gas.  I would assume 
that it would fall under the IF Kern index.  

Thanks,
Mike

We have created the new southern border index products for Socal and PG&E 
topock.  Please create your new basis and gas daily products for these 
indices as soon as possible.   Mattt will need to create the gd index 
products as well.  Let the brokers know about the new indices  I have the 
back office setting up new curves to book these deals.  You will have two 
curves for Socal now.  The curves will show your risk on the old index, as 
well as the new index.  The new Socal index is the same as the old except 
that excludes KRS.  

I will be taking these phys products out on EOL as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Mike

Frank,

The new procedures for trading basis are working well.  We still need to get 
the desk comfortable with submitting orders to you guys, but overall I am 
pleased with the new procedure.    I need to work on staying out of the basis 
market entirely going forward. Can you also try to work all basis at Socal 
through Keith.  Let Keith and Mo see all of your Socal/Malin spreads in the 
future.  I think I gave you an order to work Apr-Oct 02 socal/malin at the 
same time Keith was trying to sell a-o 02 socal basis.  I will let him know 
in the future so that we do not cross him in the market.

Thanks,
Mike

The index products look great.  Can you have the same constraint language 
included on the PG&E Topock location for creating the phys forward (fixed 
price) product?  Let me know when that is done.

Thank you.

Mike

Let's talk to Matt about the forecast sheets for Socal and PG&E.  He needs to 
work on the TW sheet as well.   Also, I would like him to create a sheet on 
pipeline expansions and their rates and then tie in the daily curves for the 
desk to use.

Mike

Mark,  

Please describe in detail, the downstream capacity available to transport 
this gas.  How does the CIG capacity being sold to Coastal impact this 
point?  If you can make the case for this gas flowing without constraint, 
then I see no problem in making a fixed price bid for the full volume.

A rough sketch of the gas location and its downstream flow options would be 
nice. 

Thanks,

Mike 

I sent an email to Phillip as well.  We will find out.

Please check the gd swap cheyenne positions for March.  I am confident that I 
have cheyenne short positions on this month, but they are not showing up in 
the intraday tab.  Please check to see if they are booked as kern/opal by 
mistake.

Thank you.

Mike

Melba,

Thank you for your assistance.  These look good.

Mike

You guys have no chance of building a strong presence here at Enron.  Susan 
and I will make sure of it.

Stick to the Galant Night and Blancos.

	
	

	
	

Melba,

Please set up the Souther border, PG&E and Southern Border, Socal inices in 
the database.  We have new risk coming in April that needs to find a market 
soon on EOL.   We can have NGI send you the new index posting if you need 
it.  Also, please acitvate long term index products of one year.  There is 
also a PG&E topock phys product in the one month category for april that 
needs to be activated.  

I look forward to hearing from you Monday morning.

Sincerely,
Mike Grigsby

Will you stop by when you get a chance to do the following:

1. set up network connection to laptop
2. download passport and gasselect on desktop and laptop
3. level the monitors

Ina,

Passport will probably need to be set up on Mike's desktop by an IT person. 
Most of the time they have to copy the application from my desktop
to make it work. For Gasselect, I will check with Mike and see if it is 
working. I believe all he needs is the login ID and password to make that 
work.
If you need anything else, let me know.

Dear John,

I had a meeting with Phillip after our morning discussion about P&L and it 
seems that there may be some issues regarding how I run my book.  It was my 
mistake about whether or not the put options for April Socal were booked 
properly.  The options were booked properly by Larry May and my Book runners 
and the profit was realized for 03/08.   My apologies for declaring that the 
options were not in my position.  Also, the tolls curves are not treated as 
schedule C.  I will adjust the tolls curves to account for basis curveshift 
as needed.  My P&L did not match the Socal position because of physical index 
curveshift and an adjustment to transport.  

The discussion and feedback from Phillip regarding your conversation with him 
concerns me.  I am confident that I run the most accurate physical and 
financial trading book within Enron.   I will stand on the fact that no one 
within the market has a better understanding of his/her position better than 
I.  The physical/financial risk in my book is managed to a standard not seen 
at Enron since I have been here.   Few people realize the great lengths I go 
to to manage the risk in the IM West trading book.  

I am transitioning from my role as a trader on the west desk to one that it 
is responsible for communicating with you directly.  Let's get together and 
discuss exactly what my responsibilities to you will be going forward.   It 
may be that I relied to heavily on my subordination to Phillip Allen up until 
this point.  This may have contributed to my miscommunication with you.  I 
will see that this will not happen in the future.  Thank you for all of my 
added responsibilities.

Sincerely,
Mike Grigsby

Matt, your new responsibility for 7:30 meeting will be to go over all gen 
outages in the west by region and fuel type, and to discuss the previous days 
gen numbers and load forecasts.  Including pricing info and heat rates from 
the Portland guys and/or Megawatt Daily will also help.  Effective on 
Thursday.

Thanks,
Mike

Let's have Matt start on the following:

Database for hourly storage activity on Socal.  Begin forecasting hourly and 
daily activity by backing out receipts, using ISO load actuals and backing 
out real time imports to get in state gen numbers for gas consumption, and 
then using temps to estimate core gas load.  Back testing once he gets 
database created should help him forecast core demand.

Update Socal and PG&E forecast sheets.  Also, break out new gen by EPNG and 
TW pipelines.

Mike

Our associates on the desk have asked why they have been included in the 
associate evaluation.  Are they in the corporate associate pool or are they 
simply designated associates on the trading floor?  No big deal - just 
forwarding their comments.

Mike

As you approach the mid point in your current rotation, please take this 
opportunity to fill out an evaluation form on your experience thus far.  This 
form will enable the Program's Career Development department to monitor many 
things such as quality of work, business unit culture and knowledge gained 
within your rotation. 

You will be pleased to know that your input will be used to staff new summer 
and full time employees.  We will also be able to identify any potential 
areas of improvement within the business units.  The Career Development 
department will be able to provide valuable information and compare rotations 
amongst business units.  This information will be provided to Commercial 
Staffing Leads and other business unit leaders.

Remember, it is an opportunity to be heard.  Please complete the attached 
form and return to me via email or inter office mail.  If you would like this 
to be anonymous, please leave off your name but be sure to include your 
rotation information.  Thanks so much.

Thank you.  Will you please show me the detail from yesterday's difference 
and today's difference?

Mike

I would like to take a quiet stroll with you in a dark alley.  

Grigsby

Yours.  I hate golf. Thanks for thinking of me.

Grigsby

We ar so proud of you.

Anne, on the last day of the month we need to send in the index before noon.

Let's set up the new indices on Tues.  PG&E topock and Socal border.  

Matt and Frank will set up new products for gd swaps and basis.  I am working 
on the phys index.

Keith will change the socal index from Southern CA border average to 
Southern  border, Socal.  This new index excludes KRS.

Grigs

Will you please set up the 100% flow SJ product?  I would like the title to 
be just like the current EP product -  no mention of 100% flow on the title.  
I would like to avoid making this a separate index posting.  Let's make this 
available to the entire market.

Thanks,
Mike

What is this for?

Let's start thinking about transitioning SJ to 100% flow.  I would like to 
discuss all of the issues and costs of presenting such a product to the 
market.  Think about what we might need in the form of Northwest transport, 
storage, operations personnel, etc.  I realize that this will be risky and 
that I may experience some financial downside with this endeavor, but I think 
we should press forward.  Will we need intra-day traders to place the gas?  
Do we need to establish intra-day relationships with SJ producers, utilities, 
etc?  Will the allocation on EL Paso in April alleviate some of the cuts?

Let's discuss in detail.

Mike

Looks great!

gracias

I will submit the move request for the west desk on Monday.  We should have 
Anne fill this spot. I would like her to keep track of New Current day and 
all new deals that flow through the desk.  She can coordinate tickets to your 
group and make sure that they get booked throughout the day.  She can also 
put physical deals in Sitara.  Let me know what the desktop PC will need to 
be loaded with.  Start thinking of other tasks that she might be able to 
accomplish so that your group may get home at an earlier time each day.  You 
can keep this desk for your own use and rotate people through as needed.

Thanks,
Mike

Please activate long term phys index products in draft.  They are one year 
index products 02-04.

Thanks,
Mike

Will you please set up two new indices in the database.  The first one will 
be NGI Southern Border, Socal.  This is different for the current NGI Socal 
border index in the system.  Also, please set up NGI Southern Border, PG&E.  
Let me know when they have been added.  These indices will begin posting in 
NGI for April, 2001.

Thank you,
Mike Grigsby
x37031

We should change all settlements at Socal to NGI Southern Border, Socal from 
Southern California Border average.  This new index excludes KRS fixed priced 
trades.  Please let the brokers know about the changes to Socal basis going 
forward.  Please change basis and gd swing swaps (fp and index) in EOL.

Also,  Frank and Matt should set up basis and a gd swap (fp and index) for  
southern border, PG&E.  This will be the index for PG&E Topock.  This index 
will be effective for April 2001.  I will have the physical product out there 
as soon as possible.

Let me know when they have been changed.

Dear Jeff,

I am interested in summarizing all of our contracts in the western region and 
identifying any problems (i.e. penalty language, notification deadlines for 
OFOs, etc.) that may need to be addressed.  We have experienced a few 
problems with SW Gas Corp. recently.  They have been penalizing Enron for 
cuts on EPNG, but when we pursued penalties with them on a baseload one month 
deal last month, they claimed that all one month deals have been booked on an 
interruptible contract and cannot be penalized.  This was news to me.  Can 
you help me identify what types of contracts we are using to transact 
business with our customers in the west?

I can honestly say that these contracts have not been reviewed by the west 
desk for some time.  Phillip Allen transferred the desk to me  in August of 
2000 and I have not spent the time to review all of contracts.  Let's get 
together and discuss exactly what I may need.

Sincerely,
Mike Grigsby
x37031

Good morning.  I am going to unavailable for the interviews on Monday.  The 
continued Califonia energy crisis and Enron's gas positions will not allow me 
to leave the desk on Monday.  I apologize for the inconvenience, but my time 
must be spent in the office.  Please let me know how I may be able to assist 
the interview process in the future.  I am always willing to help out when I 
have the time.

Sincerely,

Mike Grigsby

Patti, will you please review each of the SW Gas deals on this spreadsheet 
and let me know which deals they penalized us for?  We are looking to see if 
they have been penalizing multiple deals or one deal in particular.  They 
claim that all one month deals fall under an IT contract that cannot be 
penalized.  I want to make certain that they did not penalize one month deals.

Thanks,
mike

Texaco has short paid us by 1.5 million for Socal cuts.  I believe that they claimed a penalty on the net out for the amount.  We do not agree with this short pay and stand by the description of the Socal product in which it states that there will be cuts due to operational constraints on the upstream pipelines.  I would like to return the short pay favor to Texaco.  Please let me know how we should proceed.

Don, 

I remember him as being a passive guy.  He is very conservative, level headed, and fairly organized.  I would test his ability to handle new businesses and stress.

By the way, he worked at Coastal when I was there.

I love the "club" quote, because they really are.  It is a good old boy network that colludes against every day and every month.  In this case, the "club" is Reliant, Williams, Duke and others who own TW transport to SJ from Ignacio.  Our TW transport expires in Dec, so for Enron to bid firm 100% flow in the SJ, we have to price it at a discount because of the cuts through Bondad on El Paso.  We could bid higher if it was average flows or we had TW firm transport.

Mike, Who do you think the "club" is?

Linda,

After our conversation yesterday, I spoke with Tad Herz of Cordillera.  According to Tad, Cordillera has received bids from some "small niche" marketers for their San Juan production that were very attractive.  Per Tad, these local marketers enjoy some market advantage that allows them to overcome the large discount ($0.15) that Enron sees at the tailgate of the Ignacio Plant.  Tad referred to these marketers as a "club".  Therefore, Cordillera is not interested in Enron purchasing its San Juan production.  

Tad has requested that Enron modify/limit its proposal to just the Mid-Continent gas.  Contrary to Tad's comments on Tuesday, Tad stated yesterday that our Mid-Continent bid was competitive and Enron was definitely in the running for the Mid-Continent gas.  On Tuesday, Tad said Enron's Mid-Continent price was a little low.  For what its worth, Tad stated that Cordillera's target area to grow its production is the Mid-Continent area.   

Per our conversation, you said that the only way to improve Enron's Mid-Continent bid was to look at trying to sell the gas in the Mid-Continent area to some outside company.  Is this practical for the small volume that Cordillera controls?  Should Enron even look at selling wellhead gas to companies outside of Enron?  It appears that Enron may not be able to improve its proposal.

Linda,  I told Tad that we would target Friday to get a revised proposal to him.  We could have more time if we need it.  

Let's discuss this matter.

I would like to set up a brief meeting in the afternoon this week or next, to discuss increasing the liquidity in west basis on EOL.  It would be helpful for our desk to sit down with John Arnold and John Lavorato to openly discuss the importance of continuing to increase liquidity on EOL.
 
I would also like to put to rest the notion that increasing liquidity leads to negative P&L and that a Trader's support of EOL liquidity will go unrecognized at year end PRC.
 
Please email me with a response of when we could set up such a meeting.
 
Sincerely,

I would like to set up a spreadsheet to enter each deal that I transact, internal and external.  I would then like columns set up that allow Monte to enter post ids for all hedge strips for prior day and new day.  We should then sum the net change of the two and balance against the columns summing the new deals that I enter each day. 
 
This method should give us another way of checking if all new deals are being booked properly.  Please meet with Keith Holst to discuss how to set up the sheet.  He has a similar process of checkking new deals.  Once this is set up, please have each bookrunner adopt the same prcatice with their trader.  
 
I would like Anne to be responsible for seeing that this new process is in place for next week's business.
 
I understand that the standard for most deals is 5000/d and that this can lead to booking 50000/d at this volume.  We need to have Anne set up a trader deal sheet that lists the volume and price in a clear and legible format for all bookrunners.

In this application, PG&E proposes a market structure and rules for the
northern California natural gas industry, beginning 
January 1, 2003.  PG&E's filing was in response to a recent Commission order
(Decision 01-09-016), which directed PG&E to file a "Gas Accord II"
application.

Now that all of the data has been collected for the West, we can sort and present it however you want on Monday.

Have a good weekend.

Thanks

Anne << File: Credit_10_26_totals.xls >>  

Sure.   12:15?

I have some ideas, if you want to hear them, about Susan and what I would like out of the eastern rockies assistant trader/cash trader.  I can e-mail you my thoughts or we can talk about them or both.  Let me know when you want to talk about this.

Jay

Happy Birthday Rice. 

Grigs

We will meet for thirty minutes before our 3:30 fundies meeting.  

1.  EOL market making - Lavo has asked us to increase basis liquidity.  Janie has mentioned general theme of market, "why trade on EOL 5000/d and risk moving the market".  We are becoming market framers.  I think Frank Ermis is a pioneer.

2.  Deal confirmations - Anne Bike misbooked a deal for me from March, cost $3.5 million.  How do we deal with this issue of confirmations missing deals.

3.  Vacation and work hours - Discuss vacation schedules for the rest of the year.  We need to do a good job of coordinating when we are out.

Mike

 
Charts for today's meeting are attached: 

Okay. 

I would prefer to have these folks not use ice.
Most of the trades are next day physical.  Versen, South, Storey, M. Smith, Germany, Pereira, Hodge, Weldon and Baumbach are using ICE to balance physical positions.  Vladi executed a bal month TETCO M3.  Johnny executed a cal 2 swap.

Today at 3:00?  Let me know.

Mike

Hi Mike,

I have some analysis done for the sendout forecast. Let me know what would be good time to come down to your desk so that I can show some graphs and clarify some questions.

Thanks

Okay.  I will reserve them for you, but with the understanding that they are for Trading growth and can disappear at any time.  

Thanks,
Mike 

Mike,

I think it's a great idea to have a couple of spots on the floor. I would like to have the spaces and let people rotate sitting up there during trading. I think Shannon would be up there most mornings but she will need a spot downstairs since she schedules as part of a team. With Ted leaving and new people working with Shannon, she will be spending a lot of her time training. As for the Rockies area, they are all enthusiastic about learning more and I would like them to be able to rotate sitting on the floor. Let me know if that sounds OK to you.

Patti

I have added two spots on the desk for logistics.  I thought it would be best to have one rep for the Rockies, Stacy Brewer and one for the Southwest, Shannon Groenewald.  It would be nice to have Patti on the floor, but it would be like taking the teacher from the classroom.  

Let me know what you think.

Mike

That is fine.  Please give Monique's phone and box to Matt Smith as well.  I am not sure which pc to give Matt Smith, flip a coin.

Mike,

Matt Lenhart wants one of Moniques monitors.  I am already giving one to Mog.  Is it okay to give another one to Matt.

Also Matt Smith wants Moniques 2nd CPU to run his EOL.  He only needs the small form factor to run EOL.  Let me know which one you want him to have.

-Ina

Thank you.  Would this report be real time?  Stop by when you get a chance.
 
Mike

Mike, 

        I just wanted to shoot you and email to let you know I've spoke with Chris Gaskill about the possibility of making the Daily Cash Trades Report automated.  We are in the process of refining our ability to capture EOL deal data, but I expect we should be able to generate this report for you in the near future.

I understand you are out today, but I'll swing by next week to give you some more information. 

Thanks, 

Dave 

Ina,
 
Will you please have an HR rep handle communications with Jim Hemmerly and his executive search firm, Michael Hubley (number listed below).  Don Black and I are interested in talking with him further and would like to communicate through HR.  Please let me know when they have been contacted.
 
Thanks,
Mike
 
Will you schedule him for an hour each with Phillip and I and 30 minutes with the other guys.  Thanks.
he can come in 10/1 or 10/2.  Is this okay with you.  He said this week is crazy and next week is bidweek.
 
-Ina
Please set up a time for this candidate to visit enron and interview with the desk heads.

Tom, 

Please review and let me know if this helps.  If it works, then please forward to other interested parties on your desk.

Thanks,
Mike 

Please send me an email list of all of our west traders and their work numbers.

Thanks,
Mike

This is true.  They will not tell us for how long, but they did shut-in 45,000/d.  

- first we are seeing of this.......will ask around if the downside level of $2.25 has been discussed with our guys ....
- Gas Daily this morning page 2 comments on potential shut in on Colorado Interstate Pipe due to too much water in the pipes.Finding out more about the volume, timing, likelihood etc.

Comments from SSMB E & P report.....

"LOWER NATURAL GAS PRICES LEAD TO "MODERATION" IN PRODUCTION

With the significant pull-back in natural gas prices, EOG Resources announced
that it has already scaled back drilling activities during the second-half of
this year and is also "moderating" production from existing wells, primarily in
West and South Texas where it has shorter-lived wells.  Production "moderation"
of roughly 50 MMcf/d, or about 6.0% of the company's current total North
American natural gas production, commenced in September and is expected to
continue through at least November.  On the drilling side, the company is
currently operating 40 rigs versus a peak of 51 this past summer and expects to
end the year with around 35 rigs operating.  Nonetheless, the company is
maintaining its $800-900 million capital program for the full-year, although
actual spending is now expected to come in toward the lower end of this range.
Importantly, EOG management stated that prior to production "moderation" and
reduced drilling, the company was on course to achieve its previously stated
North American production growth target of 4.0%.  With regard to 2002,
management is still optimistic that it can achieve a 4.0% production growth
next year if composite spot natural gas prices average at our current forecast
of $2.25/MMBtu."

Enjoy the game.

Figured I'd send you some of my propaganda.

One thing that you didn't point out:  The "repeat blowouts" of 1973 and 1987 occurred precisely 14 years apart.  This year, of course, falls exactly 14 years from 1987.

I like the way this is shaping up.

>>> " ksw" <kswalker@sbcglobal.net> 10/03/01 02:56PM >>>
Since 1950 (which all Sooners know is the true beginning of college football) OU has blown-out Texas by 27 or more points 7 times.  The years were; 1952, 1956, 1972, 1973, 1986, 1987, and 2000.  

The Sooners record in the year following said blow-outs is 6-0, soon to be 7-0.  Not to mention that OU repeated the blowout twice in the years 1973 and 1987.

Subsequent year scores:
1953: OU 19 Texas 14
1957: OU 21 Texas   7
1973: OU 52 Texas 13
1974: OU 16 Texas 13
1987: OU 44 Texas   9
1988: OU 28 Texas 13
2001: OU  ?  Texas  ?

My fault for forwarding the email without reviewing. I apologize.  I have asked Kim Ward to send me the complete file.

Thanks,

Hi Mike,

The data that you sent, it has may, june and july 2001 load data. But, if you are interested in winter load forecast, we need to have some winter data. I was wondering if I could use some of the old data we received before.
Please let me know.

Nice job.  Thank you for publishing this each day.

Thanks,

P.S. I nominated you to interview for the Trading Track.  It is your option.

This is yesterday's file... how do the spark spreads look?  Wasn't sure if you want heat rates based on next-day prices...

Please define close?  Also, what is the outstanding issue with Redwood?  Please set up another meeting with a copy of the actual flows to Palo, sales prices, third party deals and an example of an invoice.  I would like to walk through the deal.
 
Thanks,
Mike

I met with Settlements on Friday, and we were relatively close for the August invoice.  The Redwood Gas is an outstanding issue for us and Palo Alto.  When we finished on Friday we left a few action items, but my take on the meeting was that we have the deal in the system in a manner that will flow to the back office groups relatively smoothly.  
 
I will keep you posted.
 
Thanks
 
Anne  

How is this issue?

I will set up a meeting with settlements to make sure that everything looks good from their end, and to clarify the payments that are made.  I also need to meet with volume management to emphasize how the volumes should be allocated when the actuals arrive from the pipeline statements.  I think that Daniel has the scheduling issues under control.  Jason, Daniel, and I worked to get everything straight for September.  October will not be much different.  The only exception for October is that we do not have any third party gas coming from Enron, only BP.   This actually makes life easier. As soon as I meet with the 2 back offices groups, I will report what I learned.  Based on my meetings with settlements during July's process, I am confident that the deal is booked as well as the system can handle. However, checking and double checking the processes will not hurt.   
 
I will schedule something with you and Kim after my other meetings.  Hopefully next week.
 
Imbalances for Rockies and Citizens -  I will let you know.  
 
We just finished cleaning up the SOCAL imbalances.  We are clear through June as far as P/L is concerned.  I think Matt Smith was working on July.  We did have some old issues to clean up as the process was passed from Kim O. to Jane, but we have worked through the problems.
 
 
Thanks for the note on the group.  I am holding a learning lunch tomorrow.  I want to make sure that our processes are as tight as possible, especially since bid-week is coming up.  We have a good method for checking that all of the failed desk to desk deals are booked correctly, so it should go more smoothly.  It will still be slow.  Also, Randy Bhatia is working with EOL on resolving their logic issues.  We are working towards a solution that will get the deals booked automatically.   I will let you know the time line soon.
 
I have a question.  What does the "Wood" report mean ?  
 
See you.
 
Anne  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Disregard attachments.  How does the system know not to pay Palo for the gas daily deal at malin?  You did this because gas daily will not show up as risk and Kim puts together a manual invoice and will not pay them for the third party supply?  I want this deal to flow in the event Kim decides to travel the world.
 
Please set up another meeting to discuss this deal.  i will never understand.  is it just me?
 
Also, i still need to clean up imbalance deals from July with citizens and in the rockies. 
 
By the way, you are doing a great job.  It seems like your group is getting their books run early. 
 
Also, have you ever talked to your group about secrecy and the fact that we never tell anyone in the market about P&L and/or positions.  Just a reminder.  You may want to talk to them about confidentiality.  You never know who has a roommate from college at El Paso or Dynegy.  Right? 
 
 
Mike:  Am I supposed to do something with the attachments ?  They did not transfer through on the e-mail you forwarded.  Kim has never given me any additional information regarding the loads.  All we did on this deal recently was book the newest fixed price deal at Malin, and book the BP volumes (3rd party deals) that have been projected at Malin.

On the BP gas: ..... We book a deal in which ENA purchases gas from Palo Alto at Gas Daily flat.  Daniel Schedules the gas on the transport directly from BP.  We enter the purchase in our system to show that you have 1,500 mmbtu/day at Malin that must be put on the transport to City Gate.

We have not rebooked the origination.  I am still using the estimated burns that were given to me at the inception of the deal.

Let me know if this clears everything up.  

Thanks 

Anne  

Will show me how this deal and the orig was rebooked?  Also, please show me how the third party deals were booked.

Thanks,

Our move date is set for Friday, 11/9/01.  At this time they will be moving the gas trading group to the 6th floor and the gas operations group to the 5th floor.  They will follow with the power groups on the following Friday, 11/16/01.

Assistants: Please be ready to submit a churn on this Friday 10/5/01 for your individual groups (I will let you know if this changes and once I am certain of the seat numbers for your groups, I will give them to you). I will also need to give you your mail stop locations at the new building, which I am working on now with the mailroom.  In the meantime, from now till we move, please start cleaning up your areas and your groups areas and discarding anything that isn't needed.  It has been requested that only 6 boxes per person be moved because space is limited.  So we need to decide what can be sent to archives.  I will send you some forms for this. Please come to me with any questions.

Deskheads:  Unless, there is any changes from the office of the chair, I will set up a meeting with each one of you on Thursday to make sure you have no changes to your seating.  Once the churn is submitted there can not be any changes other than new additions to the group or deletions from the group.  This is to prevent there being any mixups when installing equipment at the new building.

Are we going to cover the western Canada fundamentals presentation and the X tomorrow? Please send Keith an email so that we may set an agenda.

Thanks,
Mike

I am guessing that you guys have market knowledge of shut-in costs for western Canada.  We have heard all of the typical low price rumors of Rockies shut-ins at a dollar.  I am going to put Steve South and Paul Lucci in charge of presenting a shut-in analysis by field in the Rockies and san juan.  What do I need to have these guys look at in terms of variable costs.  Is it as simple as gathering and processing?  

Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks,

Is Keith setting this up?  Should we do this first thing at the Wed fundies meeting?  Let me know.

Thanks,

Hi Mike,

I will be out this week, but just wanted to recap what
I spoke to you about earlier last week.  Mike Pena with Unify,
along with Chris Hyde and Dave Dronet in the Fundies group are looking into
connecting the Unify database with the cuts information in Passport this week.
When I come back I will let you know what they have done and help them on the commercial side with El Paso.

If you have any suggestions while this is in progress, please contact
myself or Chris Hyde.

Thank you.

Over the weekend, the press picked up on our reports from last week that cu=
rrently the US has Delta Force, Green Beret, and Army Ranger units on the g=
round and some special operation forces "in-country."  Also,  British Speci=
al Air Service units, the French Regiment de Parachutistes d'Infanterie de =
Marine, and the German elite KSK special forces will be playing a role. Adv=

The ground forces are backed by a massive concentration of allied airpower,=

2.=09Fiscal Stimulus Outlook
By the end of October Congress will have passed a new package of stimulus m=
easures totaling somewhere between $100 and $180 billion, if you count the =
$55 billion in airplane and reconstruction/defense spending already passed.=
=20
Most officials with a dog in this hunt agree that tax-cutting gets preferen=
ce over spending, but that there will have to be some direct spending to an=
esthetize the center-left crowd in the Senate and in the House where nerves=
 are beginning to go raw over corporate "bailouts" that have not yet includ=
ed anything directly for the employees. So for now, here is a brief list of=
 the major policy options with equally brief commentary about their prospec=
ts:
?=09Payroll tax cut/suspension -- This has emerged as the most likely item =
to be on any final list agreed to. As a stimulus item the economics are pro=
bably better on this than almost anything else, since it puts money directl=
y in the pockets of workers who earn too little to pay income taxes and it =
can be implemented very quickly. Although it could add up to a very big num=
ber if suspended ($700 bn per year), because this is the money that goes in=
to Social Security political leaders of both parties know they have to be c=
areful about how the accounting and packaging get done on this. Still, both=
 the White House and congressional Dems are big on this. Some version is li=
kely to pass and the totals are likely to be somewhere around $30 bn.=20
?=09Accelerate the Bush tax cut -- If the original Bush tax cut was the rig=
ht medicine, then why not have some more? The thinking here is that you hav=
e already agreed to do these things, and you no longer are watching the bud=
get flip from black to red, why not put more money in the hands of those wh=
o pay the most taxes? The White House has been putting this idea forward, b=
ut not too aggressively, and the Democrats on the Hill have made it clear t=
hat they want the next tranche of tax relief to go to someone other than "t=
he rich." Chances low, but if there is a broad package, this could get in.=
=20
?=09Capital gains tax cut -- This came on fast and has essentially died. It=
 is too offensive and too obviously lacking in any stimulative qualities fo=
r anyone outside of senior House Republicans to like. Take this one off you=
r list.=20
?=09Unemployment insurance and health care extension plus worker retraining=
 programs -- These are very big among Democrats and the White House is symp=
athetic, but House Republican leaders are deeply split on this topic. There=
 are some obviously restorative qualities to spending money this way, but t=
he totals being batted around (over $30 billion for the retraining and heal=
th care components alone) send the Texas components of House leaders into s=
hock, complaining of socialism. Democrats argue that Speaker Hastert promis=
ed them support for some serious version of these programs in return for ba=
iling out the airlines without clogging the debate with "airline worker ass=
istance" packages (worth about $4 billion). Hastert is saying he will still=
 try to deliver, but his second and third in command are leading an in-hous=
e rebellion.=20
?=09Cut in corporate taxes -- A permanent cut in corporate taxes would be v=
irtually impossible to wrangle through, but a temporary corporate tax cut i=
s something that both Treasury Department and White House officials want to=
 achieve. This is obviously something Democrats will not be happy about, bu=
t if they get the payroll tax relief and substantial amounts of their worke=
r assistance package, they have to swallow hard for something. This was an =
early favorite of the administration's. As with most of the proposals that =
seemed so promising when they were first announced, this one has been runni=
ng into some tough reality. There are a few problems with lower marginal co=
rporate tax rates that have emerged. For one, many large corporations pay o=
n something the IRS likes to call the AMT schedule (that's the Alternative =
Minimum Tax), so they would get no break at all. Even more disturbing is th=
at companies with large tax-loss carryforwards sitting on the books as asse=
ts would take a massive hit on the value of these assets, since the calcula=
ted benefit they bring is adjusted downward all at once. For some weakened =
companies this alone could be fatal, since their attractiveness to acquirer=
s depends on their loss-carry forwards. Finally, many employee expenses tha=
t companies can still get are deducted at their full marginal tax rate and =
the value of those deductions would obviously drop.=20
?=09Investment Tax Credit And Accelerated Depreciation Schedules -- The vas=
t assortment of cuts that could come under this rubric are all plagued by t=
he same problem: just talking about them gives businesses another reason to=
 delay making investments. Even if the administration were to announce that=
 all of these breaks will be given retroactively once legislation is passed=
, investments would be delayed since the fine print on what qualifies and o=
n which schedule would mean huge differences in tax exposure. There is no w=
ay to propose these without delaying investment. On the plus side, the acce=
lerated depreciation is simpler to describe in legislation, and can be done=
 for a limited period without the same degree of distortion as the full ITC=
. Also, given the speed at which the stimulus debate is going forward, ther=
e may be less concern about the investment postponement issue. This item is=
 likely in some form to make it into a final package, but the details don't=
 exist yet, and its in the details that the significance of it lies.=20
?=09Specific sectoral tax breaks -- From the steel industry to the restaura=
nt and hotel industry, every trade association has a specific tax break in =
mind that would help them recover. This is going to be the hardest to handi=
cap since many of the small deals will be shoved in at the last minute on p=
ersonal orders from members and they will not be big enough individually to=
 make a macro difference. Cumulatively, though, these could easily top $10 =
billion before the special pleading is done.  Programs like high-speed rail=
, additional defense money, additional unemployment insurance for hard hit =
sectors could be shoved into this catch-all rubric. Some of these will make=
 the cut others will not, but they can add up fast.=20
?=09Fast Track Trade Authority -- USTR Bob Zoellick told congressional lead=
ers that if we had any chance to win the war against terrorism, the Preside=
nt would have to have full and complete fast track authority to cut trade d=
eals as necessary. But Zoellick found himself apologizing to enraged Democr=
ats for implying that a vote against fast track was a vote for terrorism. I=
f he can recover from the politics of that maneuver, this one actually has =
some logic behind it as a diplomatic and economic response -- and it doesn'=
t cost anything.

We will be following this for you with increasingly close focus this week s=
ince the real decisions will start to get made later this week and early in=
 the next. Again, with an end-October deadline, there isn't a lot of time t=
o waste and members of Congress are well aware of that fact.

Thanks.  Can I email this in the morning?

Just a quick note to remind you about the letter or recommendation for the Analyst Program.  If you would, please have your admin. put the letter on letterhead since Jeff Davis has asked for a hard copy.  Have a great weekend!

Carole Frank

I already had you rotating out.  I will let you know which pipe you are scheduling.  Thanks for all of your hard work.

Mike

i just wanted to let you know that i am not considering moving to the denver office.  i don't see myself in a marketing role at this point in my career.  although this year has been up and down, i am enjoying my role on the desk.  i think the opportunity that you have given me as a basis trader is too good to give up.  the denver opportunity was just under consideration as an opportuinity to move back to denver.  we can talk more about it if you would like on monday.

As most of you know, Monique Sanchez has resigned and will be leaving Enron October 12.  Monique is moving to Salt Lake City with her fianc? and will be living in Deer Valley.  We congratulate Monique on her move and thank her for all of her contributions to the west desk.

We will plan a going away dinner for Monique before she leaves.  

Mike

Is the October calendar on the web?

fyi...AK
some thought a little more on the radical side.  this was forwarded to me by
Walt Cunningham who was an astronaut in the Gemini days.  he's on the texas
aerospace commission with me...
 
If we all did this our problem would be solved.    Walt  

The message below was sent to an old AF buddy who forwarded it on to me with
the invitation to disseminate as widely as he saw fit. I send it on to you
with the same invitation... It offers some pretty good ideas.. 
********************************************************** 
My name is John Burnett. I am a DC-10 Captain for FedEx. I am also a Police
Officer for the Memphis Police Department. 

My purpose in writing this is to share some of my thoughts regarding actions
a pilot might consider when faced with a modern-day hijacker. These thoughts
are "outside-the-box" when it comes to the way we've all been trained.
Neither the FAA or our companies will suggest these techniques or implement
them as a part of our normal training cycles. They couldn't for fear of
lawsuits. 

I am distributing this via e-mail to buddies I've flown with. I'm asking
them to send it to their circle of friends within the industry, and for you
to send it to yours. I know most of us have e-mail, and I hope this reaches
the next to face the horror of some religious fanatic onboard. 

We have all had "training" in what to do in case of a hijacking; try to keep
the hijacker calm, make him think you're doing what he wants, take him where
ever he wants to go, etc., etc., etc. Save your passengers, your crew, and
your aircraft. 

In an emergency, you will revert to that training. When our unfortunate
peers were faced with the screams of the Flight Attendants and hijacker's
demands to open the cockpit door, their training probably made them open the
door. When the fanatics made demands, their training told them to comply as
best they could. I can only wonder what their thoughts were as they left the
cockpit and were tied up in the back of the plane; what they thought as they
descended over New York.... 

I hope the fanatics had to kill them in their seats and drag their dead
bodies out of the cockpit. But, I bet they did as they were trained to do ..

As you look back over recent hijackings, FedEx, and Egypt Air, and now the
September 11th hijackings, you see a perpetrator who, for one reason or
another wants to take over the airplane and kill himself. Each of these
hijackers, except for the FedEx incident, were successful. They took over
the airplane and killed everyone onboard. 

If you're following the news programs today, you hear a lot about how we
could let these hijackers learn to fly. You would think if knowing how to
fly would guarantee a successful hijacking, Auburn Calloway (the FedEx
hijacker) would have been a hijacker success story. 

Calloway had been a Navy pilot, a martial arts student, a fellow FedEx crew
member, and he took all the weapons he needed: hammers, knives and a spear
gun. He didn't have to overcome any Flight Attendants or demand they open
the cockpit door. He just went back to his bag, took out his hammer came
back into the cockpit and started crushing skulls. 

The crew members on that flight didn't worry about Flight Attendants, they
didn't worry about passengers. All three pilots left the cockpit and fought
a hand-to-hand, life-or-death battle. 

To survive today's hijacker, you cannot worry about your passengers; you
cannot worry about your Flight Attendants. You must develop a mind-set that
everyone onboard - including yourself - is already dead. Because, if the
hijacker is successful in taking over your airplane, not only you, your
crew, your passengers and your aircraft are lost, but thousands on the
ground are at risk. 

One of the reasons the FedEx crew survived, is the extraordinary actions of
the co-pilot. Although he had brain injury, the co-pilot took the DC-10 and
immediately executed a half-roll. This maneuver took the hijacker off his
feet as the Captain and S/O were struggling with him. 

During a point in the maneuver, the hijacker, Captain and S/O were thrown
back behind the cockpit door. When he righted the airplane, the F/O then
left his seat and joined the fight in the galley area of the plane. It was
only after the Captain determined the hijacker was subdued, he returned to
the cockpit and flew the airplane to landing. 

Very few of us have had to confront true evil. Fewer still have seriously
considered taking the life of another human being. I believe this is the
reason the FedEx crew did not kill their attacker. The crew's heroism that
day is beyond belief. And any action that leads to a safe landing and
recovery cannot be argued with. 

But, when the Captain left the F/O and S/O, thinking the situation was under
control, he was mistaken. The F/O and S/O had sustained serious,
life-threatening injuries. The hijacker had not. As the Captain flew the
aircraft, the hijacker, who had surrendered, began the fight anew. 

As the airplane landed, the hijacker was just moments away from overcoming
the two crew members. 

I mention this for your consideration. I would suggest that you make a
conscious decision to kill anyone who tries to take your airplane from you.

Today we are at war. The hijacker who comes through your cockpit door is
going to kill you and everyone onboard. So, how do you do that? What weapons
are available to us as pilots? 

The intercom. Command that all men come forward and fight with the
hijackers. You have many able-bodied men onboard. They are sitting in shock
not knowing what to do. Command that they come forward and help you kill
your attackers. And, they will come. 

The airplane itself. Get the hijackers off their feet. Go into an immediate
dive to float them to the ceiling. Then execute a 6G positive maneuver and
hope they hit their head or break their back as they hit the floor, galley
shelf, etc. 

Pull the fire handles, shut the start levers and turn the fuel valves off.
If you lose the battle, at least the airplane won't be used as a guided
missile on a kamikaze mission. With luck, maybe these guys didn't learn how
to do an in-flight restart. Then leave the cockpit - all of you, and kill
your attackers - don't believe it when they surrender - don't be nice to
them - KILL THEM. 

Flare Gun If your airplane has one, the Captain might consider making sure
it's loaded and secured next to his bag. I can think of nothing more
satisfying than watching a ball of burning phosphorous embedded into a
fanatic's gut. 

The crash-axe. I would suggest you have your co-pilot take it from it's
holder and secure it next to him so he has it immediately available. Makes
an excellent skull crusher. 

Your flashlight. The FAA use to require a 2 cell. A 3 cell Mag-Light makes
an excellent weapon. If your maneuvers have the hijackers on the floor
writhing in pain, crush their skulls. 

Your stolen hotel bic pen. Drive it into an attacker's eye, ear, throat, or
into the area just under the jaw bone. That's a particular interesting place
to drive it, because when he opens his mouth to scream, you can read "Hyatt"
sticking there. 

Your hand and fingers Drive your fingers into his eyes and try to feel your
fingernails scrape the back of his eye sockets. Scoop the eyeballs out. It
will confuse the hell out of him when he finds himself looking at his shoes
as they dangle there on the ocular nerves. 

Your teeth. Remember Hannibal Lecter. Eat a nose, a cheek, or a finger. And
keep eating. Attack with all viciousness. A piranha is a small fish, but
it's greatly feared. A hijacker is not expecting you to eat him and it might
make him forget why he got on your airplane to begin with. It will, at
least, impress his buddies. 

Now here's my wish-list of things the FAA could do to help, especially in
this time of war. 

Arm the Captain 
The battle is not going to require any long shots. A small revolver would be
a good choice. It would hold off the attackers long enough for you to
disable your aircraft. 

If the attackers claimed the red package they were holding was a bomb, I'd
shoot out the door glass and hope the door would be ripped out and the
hijacker and his package would be sucked out. And hey, I if I got sucked out
with him, I'd try to fly my body to the hijacker look in his face and laugh
at him all the way to the ground. 

Invite The Police To Man The Jump Seat
Police are always looking for something free. Donut shops use to be a
favorite target for robbers - until they started giving donuts to the
Police. Robbers don't rob donut shops anymore. I would suggest each Police
Department send the FAA a list of the best shots on the department and those
guys and their guns would be welcome on my airplane. 

Fill every vacant seat with armed Police - give them a donut - and tell them
to shoot anyone who gives your Flight Attendant any shit. 

Stop this silly no-knife rule. Make it public. Tell the public they're
welcome to bring their pocket knives onboard. Then everyone will bring them.

So when you make your Intercom call to the passengers for help, you'll have
a dozen or more knife wielding helpers trying to make sure their new Gerber
tastes fanatics blood. There are even a few of them who'd want to keep the
fanatics ears as souvenirs. 

None of us is immune. Take some time and consider your actions if this event
should ever happen to you. My prayer is none of you ever have to face this
kind of decision. 

Best of luck to you, and may God Bless.

That sounds fine.

Your thoughts?

Frank,

For all gas basis curves, if it does not have its own vol, then NG Nymex Vol will be used.

Winston

Winston,
Bharat meet with Francis Lim regarding ERMS and he learned that NGI-MALIN does not have any vol curve assigned to it.  However when we simulate that curve in ad hoc we don't get any errors.  Can you tell us what vol curve is being used for NGI-Malin in risk trac?

John,

Monique Sanchez submitted her resignation this afternoon. She is moving to Salt Lake City with her fianc? and will not be working in the industry.  I moved all of her positions to my book today.  We have cancelled her EOL trading rights and her stack manager ID.  She will be managing the Permian cash position on EOL for my book, much like Matt and Jason are doing right now.  We have asked her to stay until October 12 so that she may complete her SJ/PERM  production and work on west fundamentals.

Please let me know if you have any problems with this arrangement.

Mike  

Thank you for the information.

I was just talking to counsel in Phoenix who informed me that a number of planned merchant generators in Arizona were in danger of being killed by the Arizona Corporation Commission.  There are apparently concerns with interconnecting these plants where existing plants already are located, and reliability and terrorist-threat possibilities that they raise.  I don't know if this matters to you but in case it does, just wanted you to know.

The overview last week was great.  Are you going to have Phil put together a graph of all expansions?  That would be a nice visual for the desk.
 
Thanks,
Mike

Mike, here is a very brief overview of planned or approved expansions by major pipeline.  There is a lot of detail that supports each of these pipe expansions including, proposed start dates, delivery points, probability etc... 

Let's discuss needs... 

Perhaps, we can give your group a general overview on expansions in the west, current status etc.

Thanks.  Please send the attachment.

Mike,
Here is the variable cost sheet you had sent me a while back.  I linked all of the products to Reuters.  In order to get the product prices to update real time you need to have Reuters open on your computer.  Take a look at it and if you like it we can get it on the plasma.  Sorry this has taken so long, our Reuters people aren't exactly the quickest when it comes to adding products.  Anyway, let know.

There are rumors circulating that the Associate/Analyst program will be reduced soon.  Can we address this issue with some of the Associate/Analyst employees on the floor?  Will Associates be reduced regardless of whether or not they are in a core business, etc.?

Let me know if I can address this with some of our people.

Mike

Let's not forget the fact that Citizens has cut Enron more during the life of the deal.  The only company walking away from a deal will be Enron.  We will set up a meeting to discuss fixing the problem.

Thanks,
Mike

As I am not involved in the daily operations behind this deal, I will need your input in order to respond to this request.  As I have indicated, the frequency of cuts has caused tremedous concern and Citizens is considering walking away from this deal.  They need assurance that this gas is going to flow in order to continue.  Do we need to have a meeting?  And when can I expect a response from the desk?

Thanks,

Kim

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.  

We have conference room 6716 from 3:00 to 4:00 each day for OPS.  I have not inspected the room to see if it will accommodate our entire group.   

Thanks,

Please invite him to come to the interview.  I have talked to people that he worked with and they highly recommend him.  I sent him an email and asked him to call me when he gets a chance.  I had trouble dialing his number.

Sounds good.  I would like Monte to prepare my estimate on newcurrentday first, submit it to you, then calc the book.  Is this okay?

Mike

Mike,

I would like to start asking your group for an estimate for their P&L's daily.  If our numbers come out over or under their tolerance we will call them before we sign off for the night so there are no surprises in the morning.  If you don't have a problem with this I would like to start this today.

Thanks

I have stranded all the transport to the border out of Keystone for the month of December.

The transport volumes that have been taken out are as follows:

	22,836 - Keystone  -->  Socal Ehrenburg

	11,418 - Keystone  -->  Socal Ehrenburg (this is the mexican de cobra deal).  Previously Mexican de Cobra was buying the gas from Texaco.  Starting in 					December, Mexican will have to find another supply for this gas.  They will no longer buy from Texaco.  Phil Polsky is talking with 					Mexican, and a deal will be entered into Sitara, once Mexican has found a supply.  So as of now, the 11,828 supply coming into Keystone 				for this deal is not in the system.

	3975 - Keystone  -->  Socal Topock
	

I am having trouble dialing your number.  I spoke to Randy Bhatia and he recommended you with confidence.  After reviewing your resume I would like to go ahead and recommend that you come to the interview process in November.  Please call me at work when you get a chance, 713-853-7031.

Thanks, 

Mike Grigsby

Monte,

Please scrub the prompt tab, phys index tab, fin index tab, and consolidated tab.  Make sure they all tie out to the hedge strips and sitara.  Shannon will give you a copy of my physical volumes from sitara.  We will go over it tomorrow.

Shannon,

Please run a new copy of all DEC positions for IM WC CAL and give it to Monte Jones.

Thanks,
Mike

We will hold off transferring any physical positions desk to desk until the end of bidweek.  After NX1, we will transfer positions at a daily EOL Index mid price.  Please monitor my book and others to make certain DEC deals are not being transferred prior to NX1 at an IF monthly or GD daily mid price.

Thanks,

Mike

No problem.  

I need to take a few hours off Tuesday afternoon after lunch.  I have some family business to attend to.  I should only be gone 2 hours or so.  Susan will be here to handle EOL.  Let me know if you have a problem with this.  I know I need to be here, but this is something I have to take care of and this was the only time I could schedule it.

Thanks,

Jay

My physical hedge strips are not matching sitara for San Juan and Permian.  Please check the positions for DEC and take a look at how all of the transport is booked.

Zack McCarroll started with the west desk two weeks ago.  Do we need to add him to the list?

Thanks,

she was not.  do you need to see the list again to know where to rank her?

Was Elizabeth Shim on the list?  I can't remember.

He came over from Broadband.  We think this guy is great.  We would like to rank him high enough to keep.  Try 40 and higher.

Thanks,

yes if you have an idea of where he should go?  did he come from another rotation in trading?

In light of the current circumstances with the company and the concerns that our counterparties have at this time, I would like to leave the upstream business in Denver.  Moving this business would lead to confusion with our customers and to our Denver based employees.  Let me know if you have any issues with this.

If you would like to go up there for coordination and training, then feel free to travel to Denver.

Thanks,
Grigsby

Please make five copies of this report for the meeting.

Charts for today's briefing are attached:

Patti Sullivan informed me that the Logistics group performed a PRC last week and ranked Elizabeth Shim to be fired from Enron.  I do not believe Elizabeth Shim is there employee to rank for termination.  Until last week, Elizabeth Shim was in the Trading Track program on loan to Bob Hall and logistics.  If they were trying to meet quota by terminating Elizabeth, then I think they need to look elsewhere.  The Trading group should be making the decision on whether or not we fire Trading Track employees.  We just put Elizabeth on a performance plan and ranked her in the Associate/Analyst PRC on Monday.  

Let me know,

Mike Grigsby

I am not sure how to approach this.  I appreciate your comments, but the ultimate decision will be made over the next few weeks. If you would like to resign, then let me know.

Mike

Hi Mike,

First of all, I would like to thank you
for the opportunities you presented
to me on the West desk.  Were it
not for the current situation I think it 
could have been a great way to
approach west gas trading.

Since you are busy I thought it would be
better to tell you via e-mail:  I was wondering
if you could consider me in the next round
of layoffs.  I do not know exactly how this is 
decided on the management level, but
if the topic ever comes up please bring up my name.
I have had a great time at Enron, and of making
your acquaintance, but I feel at  this point I would like to
pursue another path.

Thank you.

-Liz.

Please update the email distribution list to include Kelley_Doolan@platts.com and mhenergy@yahoo.com.  Let's go ahead and send our usual format.  No changes to the sheet.

Hello from Inside FERC,

Tomorrow (Friday) is the last business day of November, and it's the final
deadline for Inside FERC's Gas Market Report's December 2001 bidweek
spot-price survey.  And what a bidweek it was!

Attached is an Excel workbook (IFMONTH2.XLS) to report your price data in.

Please take a moment to review the instructions at the top of the file. They
specify what kinds of deals to report and -- more importantly -- what deals
NOT to report.

Please note that a significant portion of our survey respondents are
reporting counterparties with their deals.  We want you to too. Please list
counterparties in the "comments" column. Counterparty information is held in
confidence and not shared with third parties.

Reported deals with counterparty information are treated as more reliable
than trades without.

Please make sure to add the name of a contact person for your company and a
telephone number to reach them with at the top of your price file.

When you are done, e-mail the price workbooks back to both
kelley_doolan@platts.com and MHENERGY@YAHOO.COM by 1:00 PM (Central), on
Friday, Nov. 30.  PLEASE NOTE THAT EFFECTIVE DEC. 21, THE KDOOL@MH.COM
ADDRESS WILL TERMINATE AND ALL E-MAIL SENT TO IT WILL BE LOST.  PLEASE
CHANGE YOUR ADDRESS BOOKS TO Kelley_Doolan@platts.com.

December monthly prices will be published on Monday, Dec. 3

As always, thanks for your help, and if you have any questions, please feel
free to call or e-mail me at the telephone number or address below.

Best regards, and I hope you and yours have a safe and happy Halloween,.

Kelley Doolan, chief editor
202-383-2145 kelley_doolan@platts.com

IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE TAKEN OFF THIS REMINDER LIST please either call me
or send an e-mail, and I will take you off right away -- KD

After the horns, NO!  How is it going?  Everything here is going okay.  The ENE story is behind us all.

Grigs

Are you hanging in there?

That is fine under the circumstances, but why were they sitting around for a few months without me knowing?  

Thanks,
Mike

Hello,

I didn't know you were going to be out today or I would have talked to you earlier.  We had to take some large PMA expenses today that had been sitting around for a few months.  They totaled up to about $7mil.  I did talk to Phillip about this so he knows it is coming.  

Sorry for the bad news.

Have a good weekend and maybe you'll see me on Monday.

Kam

Thank you for the email.  We are doing as well as we can after the Chris Simms debacle.  What a hack!  The ENE story is a good one.  Hunter and I will have you market the book, and your boy, Tate, will be the ghost writer.  
 
We will see you soon.

Mike, 

 

Just checking in? Are you and Hunter doing ok? Sorry to heir about ENE? I emailed Hunter, but he has not got back to me yet. Hope it all works out for you two guy's. I know you two will land on your feet. Good luck.

Bob,

After discussing the potential cuts with John, Randy Gay will remain as the only transfer to Logistics from my group.  I will have him run the group at that time.  

Zachary McCarroll will be transferring to west risk from my group.  

Thanks,
Mike Grigsby

Your west desk cut us on the revised flex volumes of 30000 - none of it flowed.  I am confident they will have an excuse, but they have to know what their market is before final noms. 

We need to do something to protect our reputation in the west.  The west is difficult enough to schedule when you are selecting your counterparties, but with EOL, we have become the physical "CUT Clearinghouse" in the west.  Any internal nom errors just make it more difficult to transact reliably on EOL.

Thanks,
Mike Grigsby

You want Zach in risk because he is better talent than what you currently have.

Patti will be noming a pipe and working for Randy.

Who is Zachary McCarroll and why do I want him in risk?????

Also, if Randy is going to run the group, is Patti going?

Please move Donna off of the west desk logistics.  After discussing her experience with Randy and Don Black, I am choosing not to accept her on the west team.  Let me know if we need to move her to the 2 or 3 list.

Thanks,

I do not see Monte on any of the three lists.  Will you pls check.

Mike

We put him in the West Orig team and he is being cut.  Tych will notify him today.

Let's not forget this one

Dave Fuller should be on the West Gas Orig team.  He was accidentally included in structuring and then cut.  Tych likes him and so do we here in Portland.

Thanks,

I have gotten a call from Roger Mock, CEO of American Public Energy Agency, regarding a series of transactions.

In 1999 we (ENA through Enron Natural Gas Marketing Corp.) entered into a 12-year prepay.  We got approximately $297MM in cash up front, with delivery obligations at various delivery points, including NNG-Demarc, Rockies, TW-SJ, NIT, Topock and Sumas over the life of the deal.  

Currently the end users are Clark Public Utility District (Washington State), City of Glendale (California), City of Pasadena Water and Power Department (California), and Sacramento Municipal Utility District (California).

It is my understanding that ENGMC is not currently in bankruptcy.

I am sending down to Mike's attention a CD with the project documents on it.  I apologize in advance for the absence of a table of contents, but I felt lucky just to get the information.  Teresa Bushman may have a hard copy of the documents.

Roger Mock said that on Saturday he received a call from Kevin Brady notifying APEA that deliveries on Northern were being cut.  The documentation allows for some delivery point flexibility, should alternative delivery points be better for us at this time.  The other parties to the APEA deal are anxious to work out alternatives, if possible. 

Roger can be reached at (800) 476-3749.

Please let me know if I can be of help.

Patti Sullivan and Suzanne Christiansen informed me that all west deliveries have been kept whole.  Please contact them directly if you require detail on a daily basis.  They will be happy to assist you.  If you have any problems, please do not hesitate to call me at 713-853-7031.

Mike,

We have a deal  for the City of Pasadena at Socal for a volume of 3000 a day and to SMUD at Malin for a volume of 15,000 a day. At Socal, they sold gas back to us and we are netting it against that deal. At Malin, through the 6th, the gas has been flowing 100%, but today there is a small cut and Suzanne is checking into it. Those are the only 2 west desk deals. 

Thanks, 
Patti

I am sending down to Mike's attention a CD with the project documents on it.  I apologize in advance for the absence of a table of contents, but I felt lucky just to get the information.  Teresa Bushman may have a hard copy of the documents.

Roger Mock said that on Saturday he received a call from Kevin Brady notifying APEA that deliveries on Northern were being cut.  The documentation allows for some delivery point flexibility, should alternative delivery points be better for us at this time.  The other parties to the APEA deal are anxious to work out alternatives, if possible. 

Roger can be reached at (800) 476-3749.

Please let me know if I can be of help.

Thanks.

What is this for?

 
 		         Move Request number 10972 has been submitted to the move team for processing. 
	
	    	    

For those of you that will be in the office after New Year's, we will begin an informal fundies meeting each day to cover what has happened in the market since we filed for bankruptcy.  We will go over pipeline flows, storage balances, weather, monthly and daily prices, etc. With a few of the Banks showing interest in showing a bid, I thought it would be good for us to begin our preparation to trade the market.

Chris Gaskill will be providing the daily packet and Patti Sullivan will provide the daily operations report.   

I was thinking that we should start around 9:30 each morning.

Will we be acting as agent for Pasadena in January?  Should we turn this contract back?  Let me know what your thoughts are.

Mike

Are we handling the PGT 75,000 of Malin deliveries in Jan just like we have in Dec?   Let us know.

Mike

I do not have access to this file.   I requested access to the curves directory.  Do I need specific access to the file?

Thanks,
Mike

Mike the exact path and name of the Financial Curve File is:

O:\ERMS\1ntra\CURVES\GDI - West II.xls

It would be better for us if you would set the financial index curves in this file, just like you do the Physical index curves in the other file.  Let me know what you decide.

Thanks

Anne 

Do we have a contract with MGI?  

Mike

It sounds like you do not trust her work, so we should just cut bait and move her into fundies.  Let me know if you really need her for weekends.

Mike, 

Would it be possible to keep Liz in our weekend rotation for a while to help Shannon out? All of our new people are starting this week and next week but it takes a while to get them into the weekend rotation. Daniel will probably be ready to go into the rotation in about a month but until then Shannon would have to work every weekend until then. Let me know if that is something we can work out.

Thanks
Patti

We have Elizabeth Shim working on a new project.  We let her know that she will be moving into an analyst role for us in two weeks.  I asked her to give you her full focus for the remaining two weeks.

Thanks,
Mike

Changed just a few minor things in the summary.  Please look at the titles and arrangement of the positions in the summary.

Thanks,
Mike

How is the last revision that you sent me of the position report different than the version you revised earlier yesterday?

Attached are the reports for today.  I neglected to realize that I hadn't yet created formulas for the change columns, so today they aren't working.  By tomorrow, they will be.

I have hard copies printed out if you want them; I'll bring them down in a second.

Ryan has done a great job creating and maintaining the basis pricing sheet.  I would like you guys to add two more tabs to the file.  Please add a physical and finacial index pricing sheet with the same format.  We may need to create a more elaborate fin index curve file to accomodate this file.  Please show me the fin index curve file tomorrow so that we may update.  Let me know what you think.

 Please review summary organization.

Please add him to the list.  His manager made a mistake.  
 
Thanks,
Mike

Hi Mike,
 
He was originally, however we were told to take him off as he and his manager agreed  that this round was probably not the right time for him to interview.
 
Rgds, Karen.

Is Daniel Lisk not participating?

 

Jeff said that he spoke to you. I requested that they restate P&L for yesterday.  One issue is that I set the GD Index curves and Phys Index curves as usual, but Anne failed to pull in Index.  She pulled in only price and basis.  She will fix this going forward.

Reitmeyer's P&L was an issue with Logistics.  His transport tickets were not put in until 4:00 yesterday - too late to capture.  We will talk to Superty about this.  His P&L will be -610,000, a 1.3 million increase.

Frank Ermis is still looking into his issues.

I will call you after cash trading.

Mike

Wed will be spent trick or treating.  Let me know how long you will be in town?

Grigsby

Hey, I'm gonna be in town on Wed. night.
Give me a buzz if you want to grab some dinner.

Thank you.  Phillip Allen sits right behind me and he let me know that he was going to contact you.  We will see you in Houston.

Mike,

I spoke with Phillip Allen yesterday, and I've received word that I've been invited to interview for the trading track on Thursday. Just wanted to let you know where things stand.

Regards,

I am having trouble dialing your number.  I spoke to Randy Bhatia and he recommended you with confidence.  After reviewing your resume I would like to go ahead and recommend that you come to the interview process in November.  Please call me at work when you get a chance, 713-853-7031.

Thanks, 

Mike Grigsby

Thank you.  Let me know when you are done.

Mike

Mike,
Since the IT guys want to wait for the new software to put your cost analysis on the plasma screens I am currently working on using Reuters so that we'll have something in the meantime.  I had to call Lori Hernandez, Reuters contact, and have her add some more products to Kobra.  As soon as she gets back to me I'll put that together and get it on the screens.  Let me know if you have other questions.

CAN WE RUN THIS FILE EVERY NIGHT?  ARE THE POSITIONS FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE OR THE COUNTERPARTY'S?

THANKS!

Attached is the new file with the volumes converted to contracts.

Thank you.  Will you please convert the positions to contracts.

Mike

Mike: Attached is the data you wanted for the West Desk, only.  Credit can give you the information for the entire floor.  Russell Diamond has been called back to work on the project.  I would still use Tanya as the contact.

Now that all of the data has been collected for the West, we can sort and present it however you want on Monday.

Have a good weekend.

Thanks

Mike:

	It seems to me that we can proceed one of 2 ways.  Those alternatives are as follows:

		1.  We could write a letter to Texaco and demand payment for the withheld amount.

		2.  If we are paying them this month, we could withhold the $1.5 million from the
		    amount we are paying them.  Of course, we would need to provide them some 
		    sort of explanation.

	My preference at this time would be to do the first item.  If you could have someone provide me with the details of the transaction they withheld the money on I could draft the letter.  If that letter brought no response, then we could consider taking the action outlined in the second item.

	I trust all is well with you.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks,

Jeff

Jeff,

How should proceed with Texaco and their 1.5 million withholding?

Thanks,
Mike

 

Sounds good.  Will you give us a speech when we go over?  Topic how?

Mike, I have asked INA to check into the coordination of a tour for our group( trading and marketing) prior to the official move in.

I would like to restrict the attendees to the commercial staff, traders and marketers... and this will give everyone a chance to see the new digs.. and then I would also like to suggest that we all slide out to the local watering hole for a drink... it is long overdue.. 

Any suggestions on a date, perhaps 3:00 - 3:30 for a tour.. then out for a drink... what about next tues.... 

Pls advise.

Where do we stand with Texaco?  This attachment details cuts by Texaco at PG&E Topock.  We would like to use this as a potential offset to their penalties in the event they do not waive their 1.5 million charge.

Mike 

Mike,

This is the sheet Anne put together on the Texaco deals. She has it saved on her hard drive so we can go back and get it any time.

Patti

Sorry it took me all day to get this to you.  Please let me know what I can do to help.  Each deal has a tab and there is a summary page up front.

I will help, please let me know.

Thanks.

Anne

 

 The P&L was stated incorrectly again.  The new numbers just went out.  We were down 3.7 million on the day, most of that coming from the transport book that falls next to Phillip's name.

We clearly have issues with our book runners.  Gossett is trying to fix it, but the surprises keep coming.  

Let's set up a time to discuss the desk.

Mike

Thank you.  

Mike -

Kam will be in charge of the West Desk risk group starting tommorrow.  Anne's last day here will be next Friday.  Let me know if you have any questions.

As you know, we have a new book runner for the west.  I have asked Kam Keiser to go ahead and set up two new books for you guys.  Matt's book will be IM WC Socal, and Jason's will be IM WC Nocal.  These books will be ready for when we move into the new building.  I will transfer any positions that I have to you guys at gas daily mid.  You will make the markets for your own books.  We will address having you guys take the gas dailies in the near future.

Congratulations!

What is the latest and greatest on this project?

Mike

Just an update, to keep everyone current on the progress of this initiative:

We (Matt (from Unify), Liz, Dave, and myself) met today and attempted to find ways to directly relate the Passport information (from El Paso) to the corresponding prices etc. in Unify.  Unfortunately, we discovered that there is no direct "fool-proof" way to accomplish this.  However, we have come up with a couple of things to try:

Liz is going to contact El Paso directly, and see if there is any other information they can provide in the Passport file that better uniquely identifies each deal / cut.  Hopefully, this will be something that makes relating the data to Unify much easier.
Matt is going to take a look at the format / content of the "scheduled quantity" file that comes in currently through the EDI Hub.  It's possible that this file contains cut information itself, which would possibly alleviate the need to use the Passport file altogether.

I believe that succinctly recaps the results of our meeting today.  If I have misrepresented anything, please let me know.  Also, feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns.

Thanks,
Chris

Ina could not get us into the new building tomorrow, so we will not get together after work.  We will plan on going out as a group after we move over.

Mike

Sure.  I would like to see your group participate in all of our meetings.  3:30 every day, tues power fundies, and 3:00 wed gas fundies .  Morning meetings would help you guys as well.

Mike, from what I am hearing, we will not get into the 6th floor to show the staff around ( prior to the move in).  I still think it would be timely for all of us to get together for a drink but in light of this small logistical issue we may want to postpone until we move in and then go out next week. 

Once things settle down ( assuming they do) I look forward to talking specifically to you regarding increased initiatives on our parts to ensure we are getting everything we can out of marketing and trading efforts.  It is my observation that we have not made the progress I would have liked in terms of information flow... and although there has been progress, there is a ways to go. This probably has as much to do with individuals as it does anything else.

Looking forward to those discussions. 

BT 

I would like to put a request in for Brent Dornier as well.  We think Jason Huang should move on to another rotation.  He has served the west as an Analyst and believe that he should get experience on another desk.

Here is the variable cost sheet you had sent me a while back.  I linked all of the products to Reuters.  In order to get the product prices to update real time you need to have Reuters open on your computer.  Take a look at it and if you like it we can get it on the plasma.  Sorry this has taken so long, our Reuters people aren't exactly the quickest when it comes to adding products.  Anyway, let know.

Thanks for the work.

 

We saw a larger credit spread in the market between EOL and ICE.  EOL Socal cash was trading .08 higher than ICE Socal - We ended up short and the market made it very difficult to buy.  EOL SJ cash traded .10 to .20 cents lower than ICE.  The only point without a credit spread was Opal.

Liquidity picked up slightly from Thursday and Friday, but still slow.

No new counterparty issues.

Will show me how to get this sheet running?  Drop by when you get a chance.

Thanks

Sorry about that.  Here you go.

Thanks.  Please send the attachment.

Mike,
Here is the variable cost sheet you had sent me a while back.  I linked all of the products to Reuters.  In order to get the product prices to update real time you need to have Reuters open on your computer.  Take a look at it and if you like it we can get it on the plasma.  Sorry this has taken so long, our Reuters people aren't exactly the quickest when it comes to adding products.  Anyway, let know.

Can we delete the inactive books listed in the drop down box in TDS?  Also, can we set up another selection that includes all books less Phillip Allen's.

Thanks,

Mike

Last week it would have been two cents, but now that there is a huge credit spread in the market, it may cost them .07.  We simply can't buy the physical volumes right now.  The credit spread in the SJ to cover our short is costing us .20.  

I love this market.

Mike,

We are working some orders for customers on the rest of month Aeco / Malin spread. If our customers wanted to buy rest of month malin physical what is the premium to the financial product to get physical molecules? Let me know. 

Thanx 

Chris

This place gets better and better every day.  A piece of fiction.

Fun

That's cool. I think AEC is going to do it financially with us and take care of buying the phys in the market. Did you get 80 million?

NO

Mike,

I have asked Carole to start getting a signature from the traders that set curves on the changes above your threshold.  There was a curve set wrong tonight that wasn't caught until later because Keith wasn't at his desk when she walked down there, she didn't go any further than that but should have.  I will be telling my group that they can't start calculating for the night until she has all curves signed off on.   Do you have any objections to this?

Kam

We will be limiting the attendee list for the Wed fundies meetings.  If you received this email then consider yourself invited. Please let the schedulers know that only Patti will be attending in the future.  This is due to available space in the conference rooms.

Thanks,
Mike

Will you please send me a complete list of all of our west schedulers and their pipe responsibilities?  I want to set up a mentor program with the traders.  Talk about it later.

Thanks,
Mike

Good stuff.  Get me on the distribution list.

Mike

Here is today's report:

 << File: TheMarkReport111401.pdf >> 

Mark D. Smith
Manager

Janie Tholt called Dynegy because of the .12 cent spread between SJ EOL and SJ ICE.  The Trader at Dynegy said that they were busy training two schedulers to trade cash, and that arbing the market was not the message they wanted to send to them.  They would like to focus on the "Big Picture" instead.  

We tried.

Grigsby

Please review.  I will talk to her today.

 
Thanks,
Mike

We need to protect the flows to Citizens on TW.  I know you guys have been working on this, but Citizens continues to receive cuts.  Please secure the supply off of TW.  Let Sempra know that IB Link gas will not do.

Thanks,
Mike

Let's get together after lunch tomorrow to discuss how to handle the books next month.  Cash and transfers from me to you.

Mike

Zac is a new analyst on our desk.  Could you grant him website access?  He sent in an erequest for access.

Thanks,

Thanks for the summary.

Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures.  No hand-outs were provided.

Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity
Topock  540 mmcf/d
Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d
Needles 800 mmcf/d
Wheeler 800 mmcf/d

New Receipt Points
Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d
Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d
Both will be available around Feb 1

Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation
Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.

New Calculation, Changes and Display
Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.

OFO Declaration
Name changes from overnomination
Can declare before any Cycle
Provide 2 hour notice
Post on Gas Select
Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select

Windows
Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system
Calculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.   
Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.  
Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's
Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.

Scheduling Changes-Nov 1
Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.     
Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle
Copy confirmed noms
All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.

2 Hour Notice
Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.
OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.  

Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO
Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.  
Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.
No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.
Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules
Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.
Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.  
If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.
Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.  
If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:

Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut
Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut
Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut
Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.  
For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.

For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:

         Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes
Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2
Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1
Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4
Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4

In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.

Winter Balancing Rules
Effective Nov 1-March 31
No changes.
All customers must comply.
Minimum delivery requirements
50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)
70% of daily usage depending on storage level
70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min
90% of daily usage depending on storage level
90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.
Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.
Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.
Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,

Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.

Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.  
Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group)
Not subject to 70% and 90% rules.

2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.

Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement,
Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.

Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.  Rate is posted at end of every month.

OFO can be declared during undernom season (winter season)

Enron Falls Amid Concern Debt Threatens Dynegy Bid (Update2)
By Stacie Babula 
Houston, Nov. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. shares and bonds dropped after the energy trader disclosed debts of $9.15 billion due by 2003, suggesting a takeover by Dynegy Inc. may not happen soon enough to save the company from bankruptcy. 
Shares of Enron fell $1.17, or 13 percent, to $7.89 in late morning trading. Enron's 6.4 percent notes due in July 2006 were bid at 77 cents on $1 of face value and offered at 81 cents, down more than 3 percent from yesterday, traders said. 
Enron, whose shares plunged 90 percent this year as accounting errors led to earnings restatements, a federal investigation and a management shakeup, said it has less than $2 billion in cash or credit lines. Dynegy plans to complete its buyout by October, and Enron may have to ask its lenders to restructure payment schedules to survive. 
``This filing shows that Enron is in a precarious financial situation,'' said Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade, who rates Enron shares `hold' and doesn't own them. ``They have to stay afloat for the Dynegy deal to go through, and that now looks difficult.'' 
Dynegy agreed Nov. 9 to buy Enron in a transaction now valued at $25 billion in stock and assumed debt. The difference between Dynegy's offer for Enron and the price of Enron shares widened to more than 45 percent from 29 percent yesterday, Bloomberg data show. 
``It's become more clear that the chances of this deal going through aren't 90 percent, but much closer to fifty-fifty,'' said Edward Paik, who helps manage the Liberty Utilities Fund, with 1.6 million Enron shares. ``There's just so much information that is unknowable'' about Enron's financial position, he said. 
SEC Filing 
Last week, Enron Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley said the company has $8 billion invested in ``non-core'' businesses, including broadband and the Dabhol power plant in India. Whalley said Enron will sell those business to pay down debt. Enron expects to get ``billions'' from the sales, Whalley said, without being more specific. 
Enron wouldn't comment on whether it could sell assets fast enough to keep current on its debts. Asset sales valued at about $800 million are expected close by the end of this year, the company said yesterday in its third-quarter filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission. 
Most of the $9.15 billion in debt is due before the end of the third quarter, when the Dynegy buyout is scheduled to close, according to the SEC filing. 
Dynegy and ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26 percent of Dynegy, may have to help Enron win refinancing agreements with its lenders, said Kathleen Vuchetich, who helps manage the $1.4 billion Strong American Utilities Fund, which is 5 percent Dynegy shares. 
``I never dreamt (the $9.15 billion in debt due) would be that large, coming due all at once,'' Vuchetich said. ``It calls into question their decision to schedule it that way in the first place.'' 
Enron yesterday reduced third-quarter results by 3 cents a share, bringing the period's loss to 87 cents, or $664 million, according to the SEC filing. On Nov. 8, Enron lowered earnings back to 1997 by $586 million to reflect losses by affiliated partnerships that were wrongly kept off the books. That included a third-quarter reduction of $17 million. 
A drop in Enron's senior unsecured debt rating to ``BBB-'' by Standard & Poor's on Nov. 12 may force Enron to pay off a $690 million note by Nov. 27 if it doesn't find collateral to guarantee the debt taken on by an affiliated partnership, the company said in the filing. 
Without repayment or collateral, investors in a partnership that owns Brazilian natural-gas assets can begin to liquidate the partnership's assets, Enron said. The company said it's working with lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt. 
Enron used affiliated partnerships to raise money quickly and take debt off its books. Its shares plunged this year as investors questioned whether the partnerships also were being used to hide losses from failed investments. 
Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said last month that buying back 62 million shares from two such partnerships cost Enron shareholders $1.2 billion in lost equity. 
Fourth Quarter 
Making good on debt owed by its Whitewing affiliated partnership may cut Enron's fourth-quarter earnings, Enron said. Enron is obligated to back Whitewing by issuing junior convertible preferred stock. Because Enron's stock has plunged, it may have to write down its assets by $700 million, the filing said. 
ChevronTexaco, the second-largest U.S. oil company, is providing $2.5 billion in cash as part of the Enron buyout. It provided the first $1.5 billion a week ago. 
Shares of ChevronTexaco, based in San Francisco, rose $2.51 to $84.42 in midmorning trading. Dynegy fell 50 cents to $43.05. Dynegy and Enron are both based in Houston. 
Enron's Lay admitted last week that failed investments and a loss of investor confidence forced the sale to Dynegy. Before the buyout was announced, Enron stock had fallen 90 percent this year. 

I just spoke to Elizabeth.  I told her that we would move her out of Trading Track and in to the Analyst pool.  I also told her about setting a performance plan going forward and that you would be contacting her.  She knows that she will be working as an Analyst for the west.
 
I will complete the plan and forward to you.
 
Mike

Hi Mike, Yes, he is currently in Fundamentals under Chris and will move to Structuring next May, having already spent time in your group. earlier in the year.
 
Did you speak with Elizabeth and also, do you have the form completed so I can forward to legal.
 
thanks, Karen.

Jason Huang has already done his rotation in the west as an analyst.  Please move him into another rotation.
 
Thanks,

Dear West,

We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.  

We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.  

Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

Sincerely,

Mike

No classes available.
 
Mike

Hi Mike,
 
Received the attached form back from legal.   They may some suggestions and which I added to the document.    Under the first Development area.. they asked if there was a class she could go to  to learn about products that she is week in ? Do you suggest one or is this more a learning curve from working on the floor?
 
Other than that... following your final review, legal will initial and we will schedule a meeting with Elizabeth.
 
 
Kind regards

Have we rebooked these volumes?  Let me know by Thursday or I will mark them down myself.
 
Thanks,

No !  You need to talk to Kim about this.

Did we rebook the orig for the reduced volumes?  Please send me the rebooked volumes.
 
Thanks,
Mike

I forwarded the invoice to you.  It contains all of the calculations.  Please let me know when you would like to meet. I can get Ina to set it up if you need me to.

Please define close?  Also, what is the outstanding issue with Redwood?  Please set up another meeting with a copy of the actual flows to Palo, sales prices, third party deals and an example of an invoice.  I would like to walk through the deal.
 
Thanks,
Mike

I met with Settlements on Friday, and we were relatively close for the August invoice.  The Redwood Gas is an outstanding issue for us and Palo Alto.  When we finished on Friday we left a few action items, but my take on the meeting was that we have the deal in the system in a manner that will flow to the back office groups relatively smoothly.  
 
I will keep you posted.
 
Thanks
 
Anne  

How is this issue?

I will set up a meeting with settlements to make sure that everything looks good from their end, and to clarify the payments that are made.  I also need to meet with volume management to emphasize how the volumes should be allocated when the actuals arrive from the pipeline statements.  I think that Daniel has the scheduling issues under control.  Jason, Daniel, and I worked to get everything straight for September.  October will not be much different.  The only exception for October is that we do not have any third party gas coming from Enron, only BP.   This actually makes life easier. As soon as I meet with the 2 back offices groups, I will report what I learned.  Based on my meetings with settlements during July's process, I am confident that the deal is booked as well as the system can handle. However, checking and double checking the processes will not hurt.   
 
I will schedule something with you and Kim after my other meetings.  Hopefully next week.
 
Imbalances for Rockies and Citizens -  I will let you know.  
 
We just finished cleaning up the SOCAL imbalances.  We are clear through June as far as P/L is concerned.  I think Matt Smith was working on July.  We did have some old issues to clean up as the process was passed from Kim O. to Jane, but we have worked through the problems.
 
 
Thanks for the note on the group.  I am holding a learning lunch tomorrow.  I want to make sure that our processes are as tight as possible, especially since bid-week is coming up.  We have a good method for checking that all of the failed desk to desk deals are booked correctly, so it should go more smoothly.  It will still be slow.  Also, Randy Bhatia is working with EOL on resolving their logic issues.  We are working towards a solution that will get the deals booked automatically.   I will let you know the time line soon.
 
I have a question.  What does the "Wood" report mean ?  
 
See you.
 
Anne  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Disregard attachments.  How does the system know not to pay Palo for the gas daily deal at malin?  You did this because gas daily will not show up as risk and Kim puts together a manual invoice and will not pay them for the third party supply?  I want this deal to flow in the event Kim decides to travel the world.
 
Please set up another meeting to discuss this deal.  i will never understand.  is it just me?
 
Also, i still need to clean up imbalance deals from July with citizens and in the rockies. 
 
By the way, you are doing a great job.  It seems like your group is getting their books run early. 
 
Also, have you ever talked to your group about secrecy and the fact that we never tell anyone in the market about P&L and/or positions.  Just a reminder.  You may want to talk to them about confidentiality.  You never know who has a roommate from college at El Paso or Dynegy.  Right? 
 
 
Mike:  Am I supposed to do something with the attachments ?  They did not transfer through on the e-mail you forwarded.  Kim has never given me any additional information regarding the loads.  All we did on this deal recently was book the newest fixed price deal at Malin, and book the BP volumes (3rd party deals) that have been projected at Malin.

On the BP gas: ..... We book a deal in which ENA purchases gas from Palo Alto at Gas Daily flat.  Daniel Schedules the gas on the transport directly from BP.  We enter the purchase in our system to show that you have 1,500 mmbtu/day at Malin that must be put on the transport to City Gate.

We have not rebooked the origination.  I am still using the estimated burns that were given to me at the inception of the deal.

Let me know if this clears everything up.  

Thanks 

Anne  

Will show me how this deal and the orig was rebooked?  Also, please show me how the third party deals were booked.

Our group has been selling NOV to hedge our short basis position.  Our phys fixed priced liquidity this morning put us in a longer nov nymex position.  We have sold 872 since 11:00 am.

hey plauch, still think it is impossible for this stock to take on a one-handle.  just read below.

The Intra month position total in NCD is not matching the total intra position on the reports going to Lavo and deskheads each morning.  Please reconcile.

The Broker report looks incorrect to me.  Please stop by and we can go over some of the trades.

Thanks,
Mike

Mike:  Everything in the P/L looks good to me.  I have attached the cover sheet and the reconciliation.  The estimate was off on the gas daily curve shift because Monte Lost connection to Randy's files. This meant that on the estimate, the liquidated day was incorrect.  When I run it, we are much closer (within $20,000), but this is not the # you went home with.  This issue will be resolved tomorrow ensuring that the estimate will be more accurate.  

The next largest item on the reconciliation is the transport model.  There is not one deal that stands out as the culprit.  I need to do some more investigating as to how to improve the transport model estimate.  It may be discounting.  The curves and the spreads are all accurate.

The status of the three items we discussed today are: 

1. I am working away at the new deal model.  Kieth and I are in agreement as to the basic form.
2. I gave you the broker report.; and
3.  Jeff is working with confirmations to get you both the broker confirms and our confirms so that you can sign off on them.
3a. I am also working on the desk to desk physical report.  I was unable to run the report I initially had in mind.  I will let you know.

I am trying very hard to provide the information you need in a timely accurate fashion.  If you have any suggestions as to how Monte and I can improve, please tell me.

See you tomorrow.

My position in NCD is not matching the reports issued to Lavo.  Monte is showing 233 lots long intra and the report is showing 413.  See if you can find the difference.

Thanks,
Mike

Where do we stand with our systems being capable of booking physical fixed priced deals on EOL?  

Thanks,
Mike Grigsby

I was just talking schmack.  

Not a big deal to me.  I dont even know the guy or his dad.  I just
thought you guys may be hiring.

thx

I will forward this to HR.  By the way, no one gets an MBA to be an
energy broker.  Tell him to focus on trading.  I might be too busy to
meet with him next week.  Have him go by and spend the day with Knauth.

Grigsby

Mike and Joe,

Is Enron or Reliant looking for any traders?  Mike Cook used to be a
semi-pro hockey player.  I am sure he can handle his own on the trading
floor (ie - kick your ass).

He is going to be in town next week.  Are either of you up to letting
him come by and introduce himself?

Thanks,
Curtis

Dear Curtis, 

Your father, who is a friend of my father John from Princeton, was kind
enough 
to give me your email address.  I am in my second year of business
school at 
the A.B. Freeman School at Tulane in New Orleans and I graduate in May.
My 
concentration is in finance and my goal is to obtain a position in the
Energy 
industry, either as a trader or broker.  

As you must know, this is perhaps the worst time in recent history to be

looking for a job.  Your father gave me your name as a long shot.  He
figured 
that since you live in Houston, you may know someone who might be able
to help 
me out.  I greatly appreciate any thoughts, advice or insights you may
be able 
to give me on the job market and any opportunities in Houston.  

I have attached my resume in case you do know someone who is looking to
hire.  
If you have any questions for me, my phone number is (504) 289-9783.  I
will be 
in Houston next Thursday through Sunday for a Alumni networking event
for our 
school.  I would like to meet you in person and talk about Houston over
a 
beer.  Thank you for your time and I look forward to talking to you.

Sincerely, 

Mike Cook

Mike:

How long do you need the meeting room for.  Currently you have EB32C2 from 3:00 to 4:00 on Wednesdays

Keith and I discussed working towards this meeting being organized every week.  We would like the meeting to begin at 3:00 and to have all interested parties (Canada and Portland) dialed in to AT&T.  I would like the meeting room cleared and the handouts to be emailed before the meeting begins.  Please work towards emailing everyone an itinerary each week.

You guys are making great progress with the fundies information.  Nice work.

Thanks,
Mike

That is fine.  Just please coordinate the format with Keith.  

Thanks

There will be no formal rockies fundies today since i will be in the air...general discussion with Frank and Steve along with Canada will work for this week.

Please see the attached chart outlining our Confirmation process.  This is the same process that Barry Tycholiz implemented for Origination.  I think it is a great way to verify our booking process.  

Please use the trading books that Anne Bike passed out yesterday.

Thanks,
Mike 

thank you

 << File: financial confirm process.ppt >> 
Here is the new chart.  I changed anything that used to say originator to trader.  If there is anything else that needs to be changed, just tell me and I'll fix it.
Thanks,
Mara

Can you check on the progress of the pipe expansion graph.  

Thanks,
Mike

thank you

All of the West Desk is now in your contact database for you to download to IPAQ

We will be implementing an additional confirm process going forward.  All broker deals will be booked by Risk and placed in TAGG to generate a confirmation.  Before the confirmation is sent to the counterparty, the Enron trader will sign off on the confirm.  All broker deals will be handled this way.

Please generate a new daily summary report of all broker deals by trader in the west region.  This will allow me to verify if the new process is being handled properly.

Anne, please communicate this to your group.

Thanks,
Mike

Feel free to call Randy Gay and Frank Ermis for Gas Dailies.  I do not have a broker box.  I simply make the markets for CA online.

No problem.  I need to talk to Keith, but it looks like the Price desk may have a process that would work for us.

thank you

Mike and Jeff:  I would like to review our existing new deal procedures, and outline the additions I have made to our process in light of the error we found last week.

I have attached a spreadsheet that contains the existing procedures used by Risk to check our new deal entry every night.  I agree that the process must be enhanced because it leaves some room for errors because each Risk person is responsible for checking his or her own inputs.  The existing procedures do not have a backstop in place for catching volumetric errors. We will have an additional "check" in place if the traders and the Risk group arrive at the same net new deals positions from independent sources.

The following spreadsheet describes our existing process.  The only addition to the procedures is the last section on Deal Entry.  That section describes the new standardized Notebook and the deals to be entered by Risk.

 << File: NewDeal Procudures.xls >> 

The new procedures that are being put into place include the following:

1. All traders will use a standardized notebook for writing up their financial trades;
2. The traders will no longer be entering their own financial deals;
3. The traders will keep an electronic record of the volumes traded through the broker market that will then be consolidated with the EOL trades done.  This net position should tie out to the net position entered into the system by Risk. 

Keith Holst has had a similar function in a model that he runs; However, we decided that not only is his model to elaborate and complicated to be disseminated to all of the traders, but also this section has not been working.  I am working with Keith to design a simple process that will serve our needs and can be easily adopted by all Traders and Book Administrators.

I will have the standardized notebooks ready for use by the traders on Tuesday morning.

Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.

  

Hunter asked me to fill in for him yesterday because he was out of the office.  I had an emergency and could not call the list.  Please let me know how to proceed.  Would you like me to call them today.

Thanks,
Mike

Please trade smaller in the future.  You are doing a great job making the markets  PG&E and Malin, but your positions are getting too large.  Do not stop yourself out today in one move, but rather begin a methodical plan to reduce your risk.  Make a move to get closer to your VAR.

You are the King.

Grigsby

Just want to check on the variable rate spreadsheet that you are working on.  Also, can you please change the Keystone page in the west packet to show total supply in the Permian basin with all delivery points to exporting pipelines (EPNG, Northern, Valero, TW).  Right now it just shows receipts into EPNG.

Please look at the attached spreadsheet.  It is a manual sheet that shows total EOL trades by trader.  Can we automate this sheet so that we can monitor by day?

Please respond when you get a chance.  Let me know if this is unclear.

Thanks,
Mike

Hello.  We would like the ability to trade cash with Puget Sound.  It is very difficult to interrupt the business and information that we receive from serving Puget as we near the winter months.  If you need to freeze business to evaluate the impact of the recent ruling, then please freeze baseload business only.

In the future, please call me with any credit issues in the west.  Phillip Allen is no longer the Desk Director of the west.

Sincerely,
Mike Grigsby

Did we rebook the orig for the reduced volumes?  Please send me the rebooked volumes.
 
Thanks,
Mike

I forwarded the invoice to you.  It contains all of the calculations.  Please let me know when you would like to meet. I can get Ina to set it up if you need me to.

Please define close?  Also, what is the outstanding issue with Redwood?  Please set up another meeting with a copy of the actual flows to Palo, sales prices, third party deals and an example of an invoice.  I would like to walk through the deal.
 
Thanks,
Mike

I met with Settlements on Friday, and we were relatively close for the August invoice.  The Redwood Gas is an outstanding issue for us and Palo Alto.  When we finished on Friday we left a few action items, but my take on the meeting was that we have the deal in the system in a manner that will flow to the back office groups relatively smoothly.  
 
I will keep you posted.
 
Thanks
 
Anne  

How is this issue?

I will set up a meeting with settlements to make sure that everything looks good from their end, and to clarify the payments that are made.  I also need to meet with volume management to emphasize how the volumes should be allocated when the actuals arrive from the pipeline statements.  I think that Daniel has the scheduling issues under control.  Jason, Daniel, and I worked to get everything straight for September.  October will not be much different.  The only exception for October is that we do not have any third party gas coming from Enron, only BP.   This actually makes life easier. As soon as I meet with the 2 back offices groups, I will report what I learned.  Based on my meetings with settlements during July's process, I am confident that the deal is booked as well as the system can handle. However, checking and double checking the processes will not hurt.   
 
I will schedule something with you and Kim after my other meetings.  Hopefully next week.
 
Imbalances for Rockies and Citizens -  I will let you know.  
 
We just finished cleaning up the SOCAL imbalances.  We are clear through June as far as P/L is concerned.  I think Matt Smith was working on July.  We did have some old issues to clean up as the process was passed from Kim O. to Jane, but we have worked through the problems.
 
 
Thanks for the note on the group.  I am holding a learning lunch tomorrow.  I want to make sure that our processes are as tight as possible, especially since bid-week is coming up.  We have a good method for checking that all of the failed desk to desk deals are booked correctly, so it should go more smoothly.  It will still be slow.  Also, Randy Bhatia is working with EOL on resolving their logic issues.  We are working towards a solution that will get the deals booked automatically.   I will let you know the time line soon.
 
I have a question.  What does the "Wood" report mean ?  
 
See you.
 
Anne  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Disregard attachments.  How does the system know not to pay Palo for the gas daily deal at malin?  You did this because gas daily will not show up as risk and Kim puts together a manual invoice and will not pay them for the third party supply?  I want this deal to flow in the event Kim decides to travel the world.
 
Please set up another meeting to discuss this deal.  i will never understand.  is it just me?
 
Also, i still need to clean up imbalance deals from July with citizens and in the rockies. 
 
By the way, you are doing a great job.  It seems like your group is getting their books run early. 
 
Also, have you ever talked to your group about secrecy and the fact that we never tell anyone in the market about P&L and/or positions.  Just a reminder.  You may want to talk to them about confidentiality.  You never know who has a roommate from college at El Paso or Dynegy.  Right? 
 
 
Mike:  Am I supposed to do something with the attachments ?  They did not transfer through on the e-mail you forwarded.  Kim has never given me any additional information regarding the loads.  All we did on this deal recently was book the newest fixed price deal at Malin, and book the BP volumes (3rd party deals) that have been projected at Malin.

On the BP gas: ..... We book a deal in which ENA purchases gas from Palo Alto at Gas Daily flat.  Daniel Schedules the gas on the transport directly from BP.  We enter the purchase in our system to show that you have 1,500 mmbtu/day at Malin that must be put on the transport to City Gate.

We have not rebooked the origination.  I am still using the estimated burns that were given to me at the inception of the deal.

Let me know if this clears everything up.  

Thanks 

Anne  

Will show me how this deal and the orig was rebooked?  Also, please show me how the third party deals were booked.

Thanks for playing,
Mike

Are we almost done with a master customer contact sheet?  Let me know how Steve and Janie can help you with this.  When finished, please forward to all traders.

Thanks,
Mike

Please look at two supply deals with Enserco at the Citygate for March 2001.  Nov-Mar deal, number 396352, at 11.27 and a March only deal, number 63338(?),  at 10.59.  They are contesting the fact that we allocated all cuts to the highest priced deal.  Cost $72000.  Please take a look at these deals and the cuts and let me know if we should agree to their argument and reallocate 50/50.

Thanks,
Mike

How is the project coming?  Would you like to get involved in the west fundies projects as well?  I would like you stay involved, so let me know how I can help to include you more.

Mike

Barry,

I would rather not get into the habit of locking in curves before the deal is officially closed (signed).  Can we just agree on a sharing policy, so that we may avoid the event underlined below.  I would like to consider the curves floating until it is booked.  We are all sharing the risk of Huber not signing.

Thanks,
Mike

Further to our conversation please find attached the curves on the JM Huber transaction that we have agreed to work off of. The 30,000/day of capacity will sit on the books until next week but the deal with HUBER is effectively completed. In the event that this deal does not close, then the West desk will resume with the same MTM risks that you presently have.  

Any curve shift positive from now until the transaction is actually unwound will be credited back to the orig desk and any negative curve shift from here on in will be credited to the trading desk... plus ENA Orig and trading will work on a sharing calculation payable for any future deals. 

In addition to the transportation income being generated, additional orig will be generated by entering into wellhead and market based transactions with the desks. I believe that all of the risks and discussions associated with the structures have been well communicated with each book ( by Mark Whitt ) and we will be meeting with each of you early next week to get the structures and booking set up properly.

I trust that this note covers the general areas related to this deal and I am very pleased with the high level of cooperation shown by everyone..

Pls review file and if there are any questions give me a call.

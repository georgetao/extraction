I agree it is Matt, and  I believe he has reviewed this tax stuff (or at 
least other turbine K's) before.  His concern will be us getting some amount 
of advance notice before title transfer (ie, delivery).  Obviously, he might 
have some other comments as well.  I'm happy to send him the latest, or maybe 
he can access the site?

Kay

Given that the present form of GE world hunger seems to be more domestic than 
international it would appear that Matt Gockerman would be a good choice for 
the Enron- GE tax discussion.  Do you want to contact him or do you want me 
to.   I would be interested in listening in on the conversation for 
continuity.

I got this from Carlos from a deal he and Carolyn have worked on.  Note that 
the language sounds familiar.  Someone must have sent this form to 
NorthWestern.  I suspect an Enron person.

Kay

I didn't know there was one.

I do not have the override letter for this.

I attach the form of the AAB agreement from Fountain Valley. Peter, if
you
have the override agreement for that deal, can you e-mail to thsi
circulation?

Bart, the project managers would like to get this form to ABB, who is in
our offices today. I have asked Matt Tezyk to call and check with you to
make sure you are on board before they do so. Can you let us know?

In the absence of the electronic form of the override agreement, I will
get
Renee Alfaro to scan the hard copy I do have of the Fountain Valley
document and send it to this distriubution.

Well, Ben's POA is executed, it is just a matter of getting some of the poa's 
for the subs worked out.  Come see me whenever you want.

   
	
	

Just wanted you to know that Ann Elizabeth is freaking out about Ben's POA 
not being executed yet and I think she is going to talk to you about it.  I 
told her that you and I were working on it but that it just kind of got 
pushed down in the priority.  I personally do not think it is a big deal (but 
she sure does).

Also, since Matt is taking Deb Korkmas' place I am going to give him a list 
of companies and people we want to be listed as officers.  I'll send you, 
Carlos and Ann Elizabeth a draft list soon so we can decide who we want (may 
be like the officers listed on Merchant Ventures)

K-

I haven't read this, so I don't know if it is anywhere close to your deal, 
but here's a bootleg copy of the Frontera agreement, just to give you a sense 
of some type of starting point.

Kay

Here's a draft for your review.  We should talk about the generator before 
this is sent to MPC.

Kay

Yes and no.  

They were supposed to call at 5am to see if they should come in at 700 (space 
permitting).  If no space is available, they are to go in at noon.  I'm 
guessing they went in at 7, since I think he would have called to say they 
haven't gone in.  Just a guess, though.  He has his computer at home, so I 
think if he was sitting around he would drop us a note.

Ron has requested a CA in connection with discussions regarding the proposed

Ron Tapscott@ECT
03/29/2001 07:58 AM
Terri,

In preparation for our meeting tomorrow, Friday, March 30, I want to provide 
you background on the company we will be discussing --

 Nuclear Management Company Llc (NMC)
 joint venture between -- NSP, Alliant, WEPCO and WPS
 services provided -- manage the companies (noted above) 7 nuclear facilities 
(5 sites)
 The Facilities are as follows:
Point Beach Units 1&2, owned by WEPCO, located in east central Wisconsin (30 
miles SE of Green Bay), mW 523 and 500 mW respectively
Kewaunee, owned by WPS, located 27 miles SE of Green Bay, mW 511
Prarie Island Units 1&2, owned by NPS, located in Red Wing, MN, mW560 and 500 
mW respectively
Monticello Unit 1, owned by NPS, located 30 miles NW of Minneapolis, mW 536
Duane Arnold, owned by Alliant (IES Utilities), located 8 miles NW of Cedar 
Rapids, mW 515
Michigan nuclear facility (no details)

They are looking for a physical hedge (they suggested a 600 mW gas fired 
peaking facility) but may be receptive to a financial hedge (especially for 
the Michigan site) as well.  Or, a combination.  I would like to explore 
leveraging the Arpin site if we could.  They want ownership (percentage or 
all) of the gas fired facility.  Based on the geographic location of the 
facilities noted above.  The Arpin site should work well.  I would imagine 
they have firm service for those sites and if they are looking for the gas 
fired facility to take up the slack when these units are out, we should not 
have a problem with transport from the Arpin site (even though there is a 
west to east issue).

They would also like to market the gas fired facility when the unit is not 
needed as a backstop!  From a physical plant standpoint -- I would suggest 
that we carve out the development with a slight ownership that has a put 
option (for the equity we retain) at a future date (but retain a percentage 
of the marketing arrangement for sale of excess power in the market).  I 
think NMC wants complete control based on their view of deregulation in 
Wisconsin.  I believe their long term strategy is to have a PPA with the 
above Utilities for the offtake (firm output w/ firm price) and the ability 
to market the excess (from both the Nuclear Units and peaking facility) at 
market rates. 

This arrangement should be able to flange well with your financial insurance 
product (since the addition of the gas fired facility would provide more 
liquidity).

The contact at NMC is Greg Palmer (I believe he is ex -- ETS).  I have asked 
that we have a confidentiality agreement in place before we agree to discuss 
a proposal.  He agrees.  I will ask Kathleen Carnahan to prepare a draft 
agreement.  

I look forward to the discussion tomorrow.  Please call if you have any 
questions prior to the meeting.  Thanks, Ron.

I only have you out on April 5 and 6 on my calendar.  Is there another day?

The Option looks fine to me with two minor exceptions.  In Paragraph 16,
change the references in the last line to Paragraphs 16 and 17, as opposed
to 19 and 20; and in Paragraph 22, sixth line change "its" to "their
respective" modifying agents etc.  Either finalize, execute and forward to
Ken for signature or forward an execution copy to Ken and he wil return for
your eecution.

Mike,

I'll try to figure out the conversion.  In the meanwhile, if you can email
me your fax number I'll send it that way.

Kay

ckm

Yes. I fly out at 2:30 on Monday the 9th and return 10:30pm Tuesday night. I
can try to attend another meeting if necessary. This is for all the officers
but they are doing it in small groups so I would think it would not be a
problem. Honestly, I would like to change it since I fly back to Houston
Sunday morning the 8th from Orlando. I'm not as good at traveling as you.

I only have you out on April 5 and 6 on my calendar.  Is there another day?

I'll nose around here.

I have not heard back from our HR rep yet.  Can you start down any paths you 
have and hopefully I will hear something today?

Thanks,

Mitch/John,

Here's the form of LOI I was thinking of using, in draft form.  I don't know 
how much information we are prepared to fill in on the term sheet.  If we 
don't have enough to fill in we can always skip the term sheet for now.

Per your request.
ozzie, see you tomorrow around 9:30am -  we can discuss attachments in
detail then.

No room at the inn for today and probably not tomorrow.  Carlos says he will

You shouldn't have told Ben.

   
	
	

I will be out of the office tomorrow and Monday.  I can be reached at home

Hi Carlos,

Jake called and said he wants to sign up Delta tomorrow (Friday).  I had a 
conference call with John, Carolyn and Rick Vincens, and we are pushing 
forward.  If you read this, could you tell me about any critical issues.  
Also, has there been a risk memo started, and has Accounting signed off on 
the structure?

I'll get up to speed on this during the evening, and will take your deal toy 
when the deal is done.

John,

Note their lawyers are Paul Hastings.  We need to take that into 
consideration.

Well, things are hopping around work!  Dan and I have barely had time to say 
hello, and you know how I am about getting my dose of Dan.  I've got several 
deals going great guns, so you know how that goes. I had lunch with Stuart 
and Kathleen today, and that was fun.  Neil and I have a date night tomorrow, 
so we are trying to decide what to do.  I suggested we just walk around the 
downtown hot spots, if the weather is nice.

I've got diamond seat tickets for next Tuesday's opener.  I'm going to tell 
Ben that I have female problems and have to go to the gyno so he will leave 
me alone.  I figure if that doesn't do it, nothing will.  Neil gets to go 
with me, which is really nice.  It is a 4 o'clock game, which I think is a 
neat time.  Daylight savings time starts next week, so I guess the sun will 
be setting as the game ends.  I'm glad baseball season is back, although I 
did gave away our tickets to tomorrow's game.

Carlos and his wife waited around all day to be called in to go to the 
hospital so she could be induced.  Texas Women's was too busy to take them.  
They finally called them in at 700 tonight to come in, so I guess they will 
have a late night.

You bottle of bubbly is in my kitchen.  I keep hoping to have an hour to 
bring it by.  I figure it will be good  no matter when you get it.

My transfer to Power Trading is back on.  I think some of the work I do is 
transferring with me, but I'm not sure.  In short, I don't know what the 
difference will be.  It isn't supposed to happen until May, so I'm not giving 
it too much thought.  Elizabeth gave me a brochure for another seminar - this 
one in Newport Beach at the Four Seasons.  I'm liking the sound of it!

I miss you terribly, as does Neil.

Take care and get well quickly.  It isn't the same without you!!!!!

Anything going on that I should know about.  Just 
checking in.  I'm doing fine, feel great!

Hi there,

I don't know who has or wants to look at the deal docs, but here's the main 
one.  I'm giving it a close look this am, since I haven't been involved in 
this deal for a little while.

Herman, this is the transaction we discussed on the phone a couple of weeks 
ago.  

Lisa and Catherine, I'm pondering the logistics of selling the new turbine in 
the pack with the current ones.  I have a call in to Lee Johnson to discuss 
it with him, just to make sure he is on board. I know it can be done, we just 
have to figure out the paper trail.  

Chip, I haven't received the Hancock letter yet.

Stephen, your close review of the document would be greatly appreciated.

Talk to all soon,

Kay

AC arrived around 200am today, weighing in at 7 1/4 lbs, 19 inches.  All are 
fine, with the exception of Papa, who suffered a slightly bruised ego when he 
fainted around 205.  As Carlos mentioned in his voice mail "the women were 
quite amused".  The syncope episode was attributed to a hot delivery room.  

Right.

Anyway, I don't intend to communicate with Carlos about the Delta deal.  He 
has his hands full.

Talk to you later today,

Kay

Hi Pete,

I have a fire drill for you.  This contract needs to between Salmon Energy 
LLC and GE, with no agency reference.  In other words, a CA Development 
form.  Any chance of getting this today?

The delivery dates on one of the turbines will be changing, as is the payment 
schedule.  Also, the designation of one of the turbines will change.  Salmon 
will be receiving units 19, 20, 23 and 28 (a new one).

Thanks,

Kay

Bill Williams has confirmed that the attached version of the LVC-2 contract 
is the final form.  I have added a footer stamp identifying it as "Rev 5 - 
3/27/01".  Everything else is identical to the draft circulated March 12.

The second attachment is to be inserted as Exhibit H-2 in the contract.  

Thanks.

Nancy,

Thanks for the wonderful turn around time!

I glanced through the interconnect.  It includes arbitration (poor Dutch) and 
equipment outage as force majeure.  Gee, what's good for the goose should be 
good for the gander.

Talk to you soon,

Kay

I don't know why I have trouble with your email address.

Hi again,

I'm going to have some tweaks on the letter agreement, but please go ahead 
and distribute to Delta for their review.

Thanks,

Kay

Yes.  How's that for an answer.  

I think you want to revise against this version, since this is the latest 
version Lee has seen, then blackline against the 20th version.

THANKS!!!

Kay

No problem.  I left you a voice mail message.  This looks like the
agreement that I made these revisions to and sent to Carlos Sole (and
copied you on) on March 20.  That agreement deleted the agency
references, etc. and included Lee Johnson's changes to some of the
specific performasnce guarantees in Article 10.  It did not, however,
include turbine 28. Let me know if you want me to revise the atached
document or the one I sent to Carlos.

I will be out of the office starting  03/29/2001 and will not return until 
04/09/2001.

My home number is 713-874-1244, but in the event of an emergency, please call 
Kay Mann at 5-7566.

Just go ahead and turn it, putting in a [Note:] for any missing pieces.  That 
will make it easy for me to search. 

Thanks, and have a good weekend.

Kay

Will do.  Do you have the serial number and delivery date for the new
turbine?  Do you have the specifics on how the payment schedule will
change? Do you want me to wait for that info before I turn the new
draft?  I need to leave the office today no later than 3:45 CST.  

Yes.  How's that for an answer.

Gentlemen:

Enclosed are clean and marked copies of the revised draft of the letter
agreement between ENA and DAL.  The blacklined copy is marked to reflect
revisions from the prior draft dated March 16, 2001.  In the interest of
time, the revised letter agreement is being circulated prior to review by
our client, and is therefore subject to further comment from ENA.  If you
have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to contact me.  Thank
you.

The following is just a reiteration of the Legal Department's procedure for 
handling Consulting and/or Service Agreements.  Attached are the current 
authorized approval forms for these types of agreements.

All executed consulting/service agreements should be sent to my attention in 
Contract Compliance & Administration Department for input into the Legal 
Database, filing and archiving.  Please direct any comments or questions 
regarding this procedure to me.  I am located at 3AC-1989 and my extension is 
6-7213.  

The policy for handling consultant agreements and fee payments is as follows:

 (1) The Consulting Agreement must have prior approval as indicated by the 
attached Consultant Approval Form before execution by the parties.   
  (Agreements which were entered into prior to August 8, 1999, required Joe 
Sutton's approval rather than the Regional CEO.)
  
  

 (2) The fully executed agreement along with the approval form is then sent 
to Contract Compliance & Administration in the Legal Department to 
                                my attention for inputting into the Legal 
Database.

 (3) Typically,  the consultant fees are not paid until the above has been 
accomplished.    

The policy for handling service contracts and fee payments is essentially the 
same.  

 (1) The Service Contract must have prior approval as indicated by the 
attached Service Contract Approval Form before execution by the parties.
  (Agreements which were entered into prior to August 8, 1999 required Joe 
Sutton's approval rather than the Regional CEO.)
  

 (2) The fully executed agreement along with the approval is then sent to 
Contract Compliance & Administration in the Legal Department (now to my   
attention) for inputting into the Legal Database.

 (3) As with Consulting Agreement, typically,  the service contract fees are 
not paid until the above has been accomplished.

When we receive the fully executed agreement, along with fully executed 
approval form, we will enter into the Legal Database.  We are unable to do so 
without these documents.

If you have any questions regarding the above, please do not hesitate to call 
me.

Thanks,

Dianne

Have I written you back yet?  It is such a zoo, I can't remember.  I've 
started this email 3 times.

I'm going to the Astros game on Thursday in the Diamond seats.  I'll watch 
for Ric.  Both Neil and I will be there.  I love those seats.  That's where 
I'm sitting on opening day, also.  I'm sure you will be at a game soon.  
Remember how nice it was this time last year for those first games?  It is no 
nice with the roof open. How many games do you have tickets to this year?

They have James Coney Island outside today.  I ate most of two hot dogs.  I 
bet I'll be sleepy soon.  I brought them back up here, so my office will 
probably still smell like chili when  you come back.  

Guess I'd better get back to work.  Rest up and get well.  

Kay

suzanneadams@att.net on 03/30/2001 08:21:13 AM
Things must be busy since I didn't hear from anyone 
yesterday.  Ric is going to the Rockets game on Tuesday 
with vendors and the Astros Diamond Seats with vendors 
on Thursday.  I was wondering if you could come over and 
visit after work next Thursday.  We could have drinks 
and visit.  That way I wouldn't be all alone!!!

Ruthie's surgery went well, but she isn't feeling very 
good.  She's throwing up from the pain meds I think.  We 
haven't given her any more, but you can see her cringing 
as she breathes.  Bless her heart, I know how she feels.

Well, you won't be moving until I get back, so it'll be 
interesting to see what happens.  I wonder if you'll get 
a promotion.  I bet women problems won't even phase Ben, 
but maybe, we can always hope!  Usually you say female 
problems, and the men run the opposite direction.

I just got finished paying bills!  Boy, do I have a lot 
of them!

I'm anxious to be able to go to the Astros game.  We 
have tickets for this coming weekend but I won't be able 
to go.  I can't remember when our next regular season 
tickets are since I don't have my calendar in front of 
me.

I'm going to venture out to get my nails done today 
(drive).  I feel pretty good, so it should be ok.  I'm 
sure I am going to be SO READY to come back to work.  
I'm so glad I have email so I can keep in touch every 
day so I won't miss you TOO much!

Tell Neil I miss his calls too!  Walking around downtown 
sounds like fun.  It'll be like in New Orleans.  We just 
go from bar to bar, restaurant to restaurant.  

Did Carlos' wife ever have her baby?  When is the 
seminar in Newport Beach.  Can I come with you to assist 
you?????????

Take care!  Miss you!

Here is the "Form B" that every employee signs.  I am not sure how helpful 
this will be, but I wanted to make sure that whatever we ask the Enron

Larry left me a voice mail.  Would you mind calling him and telling him that 
I am tied up on a conference call that is likely to last until 500, so I 
can't call him until after then.

I would really appreciate it!!!!!!!!

XXXXXOOOOOO

CKM

I'm on a conference call which I hope will end by then - a deal we are trying 
to close today.  YIKES!!!!

Kay

I would guess "yes".  I don't know that I like the idea either.

   
	
	

Kay,

Montana Power has been talking to the Westinghouse sales rep in MT and has 
asked SW to let Lynn DeKrey participate in a telephone call with MT Power, 
Enron and SW.  I told him I don't want to go there now.  My question is has 
MT Power violated their CA with us by talking to the SW rep in MT?

Chris

I feel bad.  I'll at least leave a message for him this weekend.

He has left town by now. They are going to a wedding in College Sta. and
will not be back until Sunday. I told him e-mail was the best way to talk to
you. He said he would try to call one time and if he didn't reach you it
wasn't a big deal.
Any more thoughts on what you would like to do tonight?

Kay,

What are your feeling about Montana Power's counter?  My comment would be to 
add a clause saying that MPC would have x (5?) many days to respond to ENA 
once notified that the turbine is again available for sale.

Chris

4.   If during the Term, MPC determines it does not desire to proceed with
the purchase of the Turbine, MPC shall promptly notify ENA in writing, and
this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the earlier of the date of
ENA's receipt of such notice or the expiration of the Term, without any
further liability of either Party to the other hereunder.  If, during the
Term, ENA determines in good faith that it is unable to negotiate for the
sale of the Turbine due to circumstances relating to the generator, it shall
notify MPC and refund the Consideration; provided, however, that if ENA
offers the Turbine for sale within 14 days of the termination in connection 
with the foregoing, then MPC shall be entitled to an additional exclusivity 
period of 10  business days to negotiate a definitive agreement in accordance 
with the terms of this agreement. (or something like that)

Gentlemen,

I have made the revisions to paragraphs 16 and 22 as suggested.  I have also 
changed the state designation of the Tarheel notary to Texas.

If this version is acceptable, we will execute originals and forward to you.  
Do you need more than one original for the optionor?

Thank you,

Kay

I'm on the phone with Mark H. (the big guy)

you still on the con call?

I'm on a conference call which I hope will end by then - a deal we are trying 
to close today.  YIKES!!!!

Kay

I would love to take you up on it, but I'm already lined up to go.  I'll take 
a raincheck!

Thanks for thinking of me.

Kay

My recollection is that each of you is somewhat of a baseball fan, as I am.  
I just happen to have 4 great seats for Opening Day at Enron Field, for which 
I very much need company to help me enjoy.  I would love it if each of you 
could join me.  The game starts at 4:05 pm, so it might require leaving the 
office a little early.  But of course we would be discussing serious business 
the entire time so that it would be fully justifiable to anyone interested.  
I will bring my legal pad to take notes. 

Let me know.  Hope you can come.

waiting for the Skipper to call for advice....

Sorry for the late notice - have been underwater this week trying to get 
Tex-Mex and Alamac buttoned up, and just realized today that I needed to get 
on this.  Will hope to see you there and try to find another time we can go.  
My understanding from all is that you are the resident baseball expert (next

We are trying to close with Delta, and they saw a March 20th draft.  Also, I 
had it  revised to take out E Next and substitute the llc.  So now I have two 
versions.  Just trying to get it clear.  I've spoken with Lee about revising 
the contract to pick up the new contract, leaving the "old" turbine in the 
master agreement, to be included in the LV Co Gen break out contract.

Couldn't be simpler.

Kay

   
	
	

The answer is yes-sort of.

The last thing I heard, 3 of the 4 current turbines are to go to Delta, with 
the 4th (August '01 delivery) to go to LV Cogen 2.

The real twist on this now will be the fact that we will need to somehow 
break the 4th turbine out from the contract.  At the same time, we have to 
confirm that the pricing (and related LD's, etc.) that would otherwise apply 
to the new turbines actually get assigned to the Delta turbines (in order to 
make our EPC contract for LV Cogen work right.

No headaches, eh?

Is this for the  turbines being sold to Delta as opposed to the new 
replacement equipment?

Bill Williams has confirmed that the attached version of the LVC-2 contract 
is the final form.  I have added a footer stamp identifying it as "Rev 5 - 
3/27/01".  Everything else is identical to the draft circulated March 12.

The second attachment is to be inserted as Exhibit H-2 in the contract.  

Thanks.

You have excellent sources.

I'm an expert at being a rabid fan and excellent arm chair manager.  I keep
waiting for the Skipper to call for advice....

Sorry for the late notice - have been underwater this week trying to get
Tex-Mex and Alamac buttoned up, and just realized today that I needed to
get on this.  Will hope to see you there and try to find another time we
can go.  My understanding from all is that you are the resident baseball
expert (next to Ken Lay).

Best regards.

Thanks for thinking of me.

My recollection is that each of you is somewhat of a baseball fan, as I am.
I just happen to have 4 great seats for Opening Day at Enron Field, for
which I very much need company to help me enjoy.  I would love it if each
of you could join me.  The game starts at 4:05 pm, so it might require
leaving the office a little early.  But of course we would be discussing
serious business the entire time so that it would be fully justifiable to
anyone interested.  I will bring my legal pad to take notes.

Let me know.  Hope you can come.

I have taken what I believe this is the most recent form of the GE turbine 
contract, changed to reflect the difference in purchaser, and filled in some 
of the blanks.  I have compared it against the Delta redline that Rick sent 
me this afternoon, after having accepted Delta's proposed changes for the 
purpose of running the comparison.   The notes included are placeholders 
since I wasn't clear if these items will change with the equipment swap.

Gentlemen:

We have enclosed the following documents for your review:

1.  Letter Agreement between ENA and PPL marked to reflect revisions from
the prior draft dated March 30, 2001; and
2.  Proposed form of acknowledgement letter from GE.

Greg, I think I included all of your comments, though perhaps not in the
exact places you described.  For example, the substance of your Rider 5(g)
appears in our revised Section 4(b); and the substance of your Rider 5(h)
appears in our Section 2 preamble and our new Section 2(g).

Please review and advise of any comments to same.  Thank you.

Comments from Enron Finance.

Kay and Catherine,  several comments jumped out from my quick review of the 
below for each of you.

Catherine and Kay:  What is the ENA Demand Note amount in 2(a) supposed to 
represent vs the Purchase Price in 2(d)?  Are the amounts correct?

Catherine:  Please confirm number in 9(a)(xviii).

Kay:  There seems to be a timing problem with several of ENA's reps in 9(a).  
Several state that the LLC has not engaged in any work/liabilities type stuff 
other than the Transaction which includes execution of the Turbine Contract.  
The Turbine Contract is an exhibit.  I assume it is the current contract 
which has been executed, through assignment, by E-Next Generation LLC. In 
9(a)(xvi), we say that we will have essentially "ownership" of the Turbine 
Contract "at closing".  This seems to also contradict the earlier reps on our 
execution of the Turbine Contract.  How could we make the first reps when our 
LLC didn't execute the Turbine Contract?

Thanks, Lisa

I came in too late to know whether it was offered or asked for, but yes, it 
is a deliverable.  The Delta deal is being financed, so they are asking for a 
lot of docs, including a letter from GE counsel.  

To make it more fun, there are complications with the GE consent on the 
Pastoria deal.  It is not a happy time between GE and Enron, but I hope it 
will smooth over quickly.

More to come.

Hi Kent,

I don't know whether Lee has mentioned the Delta Power deal that we are 
working on.  We are taking 4 turbines and putting them in an LLC, and selling 
some of the interest in the LLC to Delta Power.  Three of the turbines are 
turbines formerally known as LV Co Gen turbines, and we are buying new LM's 
to replace the ones we are using here.  In any event, Delta Power is 
financing the deal, and they have asked that we get GE sign off on the 
attached documents.  Therefore, I would be interested in your response to the 
attached.  

I understand that Lee is in New Orleans today, but I'll send him a copy 
anyway.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay,

Is Salmon LLC the Delta Power project?  The unit 25-28 prices are $
15,769,725 per unit.  Unit 28 Guaranteed Delivery Date (=ex-works ship date)
is 31 December, 2001.  A unit serial number has not been assigned to date.

I don't know how your business teams on LV and Delta agreements are
distributing pricing and want to show payment and termination schedules
between the 2 deals.  Maybe you can poll Steve Thome, Bill Williams and Jake
Thomas to get these answers.

For Salmon, the performance values in Section 10 will be per the 24 unit
master contract.
I'm in New Orleans today, reachable via cell phone 713-823-2055.

numbers must be specific to the site for the Las Vegas project.

Kay

I changed the performance numbers in Section 10.7 and 10.8 to reflect
the changes requested by Lee Johnson in his 3/12 e-mail that you
forwarded to me on 3/16. 

Hi Pete,

Are the performance numbers the same as the original master numbers?  I
recall some email traffic on this.

Thanks,

Kay,

Is Salmon LLC the Delta Power project?  The unit 25-28 prices are $
15,769,725 per unit.  Unit 28 Guaranteed Delivery Date (=ex-works ship
date)
is 31 December, 2001.  A unit serial number has not been assigned to
date.

I don't know how your business teams on LV and Delta agreements are
distributing pricing and want to show payment and termination schedules
between the 2 deals.  Maybe you can poll Steve Thome, Bill Williams and
Jake
Thomas to get these answers.

For Salmon, the performance values in Section 10 will be per the 24 unit
master contract.
I'm in New Orleans today, reachable via cell phone 713-823-2055.

Regards,

Lee

We've reserved the two upstairs bedrooms which are connected by a porch with 
telescope.  Do you have a prefence as to which you want (just is case we get 
there early)? 

You can look them up at http://www.bbhost.com:8008/moonlightbaybb/

We have Moonlight and Roses and Moonglow.

Ta ta for now,

Kay

I would think the policy would still be in place, but I don't remember what 
it is.

Rumor mill is working but you were the leak.  

On another point, on the PSEG deal, we're going to agree to a non-compete 
provision that limits the activities of ENA and it's affiliates with respect 
to the power project in Kendall county.  I recall that there was a policy 
requiring Mark Metts approval for such expanded non-competes.  Is that policy 
still in place?  I'll call after I get done with my PSEG call.

Units will be 19, 20, 23, 28 (no serial # on 28).  I think the amounts and 
pricing stays the same.

No problem.  Let me know how the pricing schedule will be affected.

I guess go back to the original contract performance numbers.  The other

Hi Danetta,

I heard a rumor that you are the one to look at this stuff.  I know that you 
recently went through the process in connection with the Fountain Valley

Hi Kent,

I don't know whether Lee has mentioned the Delta Power deal that we are 
working on.  We are taking 4 turbines and putting them in an LLC, and selling 
some of the interest in the LLC to Delta Power.  Three of the turbines are 
turbines formerally known as LV Co Gen turbines, and we are buying new LM's 
to replace the ones we are using here.  In any event, Delta Power is 
financing the deal, and they have asked that we get GE sign off on the 
attached documents.  Therefore, I would be interested in your response to the 
attached.  

I understand that Lee is in New Orleans today, but I'll send him a copy 
anyway.

Thanks,

Kay

I would like to see their opinion letter.

We have a conference call at 200 with Delta.  If you are interested in 
returning to the deal you are welcome to jump back in. I suspect the letter 
agreement will be signed sometime this week.  With closing to occur later 
this month.  It is up to you.

Yes, this stuff is for the purchaser's bank.

Hi Gaye,

We are looking forward to seeing you and Earl this weekend.  We will have 9 
for dinner, not counting the 6 year old who will have eaten (although he will 
eat a piece of bread, if offered).  I just hate to pay for a real dinner for 
him when I know he won't be interested in grown up food.

If it isn't too much trouble, could you email me the menu?

We will be bringing beer and wine.

See you soon (just not soon enough),

Sheila handled FV.  Today was the first day I had seen them.

We "took" her from El Paso, not that we like to steal from our customers (we
may have another opening, by the way!!).  She's been here a couple of
months.

Just to be sure, I never saw these before correct?  She's going to do this
job but Lee thought I had seen everything before and I could just sign off

We are going to hold the limits the same in this contract, and take the extra 
on the purchase on the replacement equipment.

The Unit Liability Amount for the Salmon Energy Agreement is currently
$14,103,675, yet Lee Johnson's e-mail (contained herein) indicates that
the price for Unit 28 is $15,769,725.  Looks like we may have to
increase the Maximum Liability Amount, Unit Liability Amount and the
payments under the payment schedule.  Let me know how what you think. 

Units will be 19, 20, 23, 28 (no serial # on 28).  I think the amounts
and
pricing stays the same.

No problem.  Let me know how the pricing schedule will be affected.

requested copies of the docs signed on the Pastoria deal, which is the most 
recent GE frame assignment transaction.  That should be our starting point.

reasonable efforts to obtain their financing as we discussed.  I will add
this prior to circulating the letter agreement to the other side tomorrow.

Kay,

1.) We are entering into a CA with BPUB, can we reference it in Article II, 
Paragraph 3?  It's term is "two years from the date of this letter", 
presumably  21 March 2003. 

2.) Under the "PRELIMINARY TERM SHEET"  where we define "Structure" do you 
think we need to elaborate on the phrase "appropriate project  structure"?  
Maybe we should say "appropriate project equity participation and finance 
structure".

Otherwise, I like the document.  I called John Davidson, outside counsel for 
BPUB, this morning and he's approved the CA.  I expect that we'll get a 
partially executed CA within the next day or so.

Thanks for asking.

I remember that the longer I played softball, the bigger the women were.  
When I was in my late 20's and early 30's, I played men's league, and I think 
they were smaller than the women!

Good Morning! Yes, that's the big girls. But, she's not as tall as the 
picture makes her look. The player standing right behind her is only 5 feet
tall. Some of the other girls are only about my height. There's a reason why
we encourage her to play softball and not volleyball. If genetics means
anything, I think her build will be more along the softball player lines! It
may also be the angle the picture was taken.

I think Annie is probably getting close to 5 feet tall, but I wouldn't swear
on it. Probably 4'10" or so.

Have a good morning!

Love you!
Lisa

The issue is getting an assignment agreement that GE will sign.  I've 
requested copies of the docs signed on the Pastoria deal, which is the most 
recent GE frame assignment transaction.  That should be our starting point.

Kay,

Once we sign the exclusivity agreement, I would like to get MPC a draft of 
the Assignment document for their review.  How long will it take to have a 
version ready for MPC.

Thanks,

Chris

Carolyn,

Please send to the counterparty (subject to further Enron review).  I suggest 
a conference call with Delta at 100 to discuss where we are.

Kay

Hi Wilson,

It would be great if we could talk this week.  I'm under the gun right now, 
but will you be available on Friday for a chat?

Thanks,

Kay

My conflicts check turned up no problems, so I'm looking forward to working 
with you. I have looked over the LOI you sent. Please let me know who you 
want to proceed from here.

Well, you know how casual lenders are about commitment letters...

Barry Welch left me a voice mail indicating that the commitment letters will 
be re-issued without the "credit committee out".  The language was left-in 
"by mistake".  I'll let you know when I receive the corrected letters.

I thought you were supposed to have your toes in the sand in Florida.  

I'll have to check with Kathleen on the details of the documentation for the 
various development companies.  If there are a couple most active we can put 
those on the top of the list.

What is the status of  Ben Jacoby's appointment as agent and attorney in fact 
for the development companies?

fyi
Attached is a draft of the SSEP standard packaging contract.  This is 
currently
being converted to our EDrafter Web-based format (The business person fills 
in a
database of information and populates the document, which is then sent to the
customer).  Our next phase in this process would actually be to make EDrafter
available to the customers for them to fill it in and work from it in a
ProjectNet extranet workroom environment.

Regardless of what document we end up with in our process, I think we should
consider a similar process for our "template document".  It would be efficient
for the business people (for example, the SSEP sales force can generate the
attached contract in about 10 minutes) and would free up legal time for both
parties.  Just food for thought.

Lets at least get the Florida ones done.  Any idea why she didn't go?

   
	
	

Want me to print them and bring them up some time tommorrow or later this

adjustments).

Attached is a slightly revised turbine contract.  The performance values have 
been modified, as I believe the previous draft had site-specific numbers.  It 
is redlined against the version you received last Friday.

Gregg:

Here is a very brief summary of my review of the LLC Agreement.  It appears 
that the only thing we really need in order for Enron to more actively manage 
enovate's funds is a resolution by enovate's Board of Managers approving 
Enron Corp.'s investment of enovate's funds according to a policy that 
mirror's Enron's investment policy.  This would enable our treasury group to 
invest enovate's funds in the same manner that they invest Enron's.  I 
believe the following provisions of the LLC Agreement already contemplate 
such an arrangement:  

enovate is managed by the Board of Managers, which delegates its management 
rights to the Managing Member (which is an Enron entity) (Section 6.1).
The Board adopts various policies and guidelines for certain activities of 
enovate, and enovate has apparently already adopted Enron Corp.'s risk 
procedures and control guidelines (see def'n of Risk Procedures and Control 
Guidelines).  The mechanism is already in place for enovate to adopt Enron's 
investment policies.
The Managing Member has the express authority under Section 6.1.2, subject to 
the risk guidelines, to (among other things) open and maintain bank and 
investment accounts (Section 6.1.2(c) and invest Company funds in the name 
and on behalf of the Company (Section 6.1.2(j)).  The Managing Member is also 
required to establish and maintain certain accounts for the Company (Section 
10.4).  
The Managing Member has the obligation to provide reports to the Board of 
Managers, which will enable the Board of Managers to ensure that Enron is 
complying with the investment policy.
The LLC agreement does prohibit the Managing Member from commingling 
enovate's funds with those of any other member.  Our treasury group has 
confirmed that any investment of enovate's funds by Enron will be as agent 
for enovate and investments will be held in enovate's name.
Enron's treasury group already provides a similar function to several other 
entities with third party investors in which we are the managing member.  I 
am certain that they would be happy to answer any questions that Peoples may 
have about how the investment program would be implemented and conducted.

Therefore, I think that the LLC agreement already provides the basic 
authorization for Enron to invest enovate's funds; in fact, Enron could 
really just go ahead and start an investment program without any action by 
the members whatsoever -- adopting an investment policy and investing funds 
is clearly within the authority already granted to the Managing Member.   
Obviously, though, it is in our best interests to make sure that Peoples is 
comfortable with what we are doing,  We could probably also "customize" the 
resolutions authorizing Enron to provide this service to address any concerns 
that Peoples may have; however, I think it would be best if we did not 
substantially depart from the existing Enron guidelines, as it may make it 
more difficult for the treasury group to manage the funds if they are 
required to operate by different rules.

Feel free to pass this message on to Peoples, and feel free to call if you 
have any questions before our Thursday call.

Please see the two additions below.

   
	
	

Kay and Ben,

Per my conversation with Ben, I have revised the offer to now read:

Lynn ,

In an effort to expeditiously resolve our issues regarding the damaged 
generator, we suggest the following offer, subject to ENA Management approval 
and the execution of the appropriate documents:

Enron will pay Siemens Westinghouse $1,500,000 towards the cost of the 
Replacement Generator.
Enron and Siemens Westinghouse agree to split the proceeds of the insurance 
claim on a 50/50 basis up to the point where Enron has recouped their 
$1,500.000 payment
Any insurance proceeds recovered in excess of $3,000,000 ($1,500,000 to 
Enron, $ 1,500,000 to Siemens Westinghouse) are to Siemens Westinghouse 
account.
By Siemens Westinghouse acceptance of this offer, Enron waives its claim to 
Delivery Liquidated Damages

Example:

Enron Payment to Siemens Westinghouse:   $1,500,000

Insurance Proceeds from Damaged Generator   $4,000,000     
 Enron's share of insurance proceeds:   $1,500,000  =($4,000,000 x 0.5) up to 
$1,500,000
 Siemens Westinghouse's share of insurance proceeds: $2,500,000  = 
($4,000,000 - $1,500,000)

This suggestion is for settlement purposes only, and is without prejudice to 
any rights or positions of Enron or Siemens Westinghouse.

Hi Rhett, I'm working on one of these turbine transfers via the sale of 80% 
of the equity of the LLC.  I'll forward the operative docs to you right 
away.  In any event, here's a change the counterparty wants to the tax 
language in the letter agreement.

Kay
Hi, attached is draft language:

Hi Bobby,

Ok, here's another detail:  what's your web address?

Maybe Annie and Katie can come for a visit when things settle down.  I know 
Michael would be delighted. We could take them to the Pink House, if they 
preferred. Neil and I have talked about wanting them to visit for awhile.

I realize there are lots of detail to attend to in the next several weeks.  
If there's anything I can do, please let me know.

You and your family stay in our thoughts and prayers. I can't imagine what 
you, your dad and sister must be going through. I can relate to Katie and 
Annie, though, as the loss of each of my grandparents caused me a lot of 
sadness. I know they were close to your mom, and spent a lot of time with 
her.  What a wonderful gift of memories they must have, and what joy they 
must have brought to her life.

Love to all,

Kay

Hey Kay - 

    Lisa will chat more later. The service is Saturday at 1PM at Hope
Presbyterian. I'll have a map up on our web site later this evening.

    I think Annie needs to stay with us for a few days. As good as that
sounds for Lisa and me, she's pretty upset at times (last night was the
first night she was able to sleep by herself).

    Thank you for your thoughts and concerns, and your cards, and for
talking with Lisa. It was tough for her being away from everything, and she
really needed you and your mom and dad. And I don't think I've ever been so
glad to be home as I was yesterday.

Thanks again, and please give my love to your family (including your your
executive in training) -

Bobby

Not that this is a big deal, but I heard a voice mail from Mark stating that 
Lance is the DASH guy while Mark is in DC.  Maybe that was deal specific.

Maybe we can grab something quick and eat upstairs.  I am underwater.

I'm going in today, can we meet for lunch?

Also, please review attached form of risk memo in which I outline the risks 
that I see in the PSEG transaction.  I have not elaborated the details yet 
because I wnated to first confirm the outline with you.  I only expect to use 
bullets below the issues I've identified.   Also, how much if any of this 
should be added to the DASH which is also attached.  Lastly, since Mark is 
out this week, I've addressed the memo to Julia since she will sign the DASH 
(I gave her a heads up yesterday).  Thanks.  I've got a 10:30 call, but will 
stop by may be before or more likely after.

I'm swamped.  I got up at 430 to work this am.  Got here at 7 yesterday so I 
could go to the game. 

Those young uns recover quickly, don't they?

Still missing you,

Kay

suzanneadams@att.net on 04/04/2001 08:44:16 AM
How are you guys doing?  Nothing new here, I'm just 
hanging out recuperating.  I was up all day yesterday 
and didn't feel too tired.  Of course the real test will 
be when I have to walk a lot!  My incision is still 
pretty tender, but I'm sure that's to be expected.  My 
waistline has gone down about 2 inches though since I've 
lose all that swelling from the infected gallbladder.  
You guys won't recognize me when I return (ha)!

Ruthie is recovering from her surgery a whole lot faster 
than I am.  She's not yelping any more when she gets off 
the bed.

That's about all of my news.  What's going on over there?

Warren helped a little yesterday, and Theresa has offered to do my expense 
account.  I'll limp by miserably until your return.

Kay

suzanneadams@att.net on 04/04/2001 09:11:09 AM
I wasn't up that early, but I was up about 7am.  Girl, 
you are putting in the hours.  Is Warren helping you at 
all or is there anything he can do.  

We are on for lunch on Monday aren't we?  Still miss you 
too!  I wish I was there to help you!!!!

$705,200 per.

Best wishes!

I don't have an electronic version yet either.  If you don't get it today, 
I'll fed ex a copy to your office for when you return.

Nancy,

Thanks for the wonderful turn around time!

I glanced through the interconnect.  It includes arbitration (poor Dutch)
and equipment outage as force majeure.  Gee, what's good for the goose
should be good for the gander.

Talk to you soon,

Kay

Hi Carlos

If things aren't better next week, I may need ask for your help (ie, dump 
this).  It depends on how Delta and Yazoo City shake out.  Hopefully, it 
won't be too bad.

I hear your deal blew up.  What happened?

Hi Jeff,

I'm tied up on an endless phone call, but wanted to drop you a note to let 
you know that I got your voice mail, and will get back to you shortly.

Gentlemen,

I have received a fax confirmation of Mr. Bruciak's execution of the 
Confidentiality Agreement this afternoon.  Thank you.

Attached is a draft Letter of Intent ("LOI") pertaining to our discussions 
about the feasibility and development of an approximate 500 MW power station 
sited at or near the Port of Brownsville.  The LOI is structured similarly to 
the existing Participation Agreement, wherein BPUB and ENA exclusively 
collaborate to investigate the feasibility of the power station and secure a 
suitable site, if justified.  It is proposed that ENA cover the costs of the 
development effort, including permitting and site acquisition, with such 
costs being eventually treated as either Project construction costs or 
operating costs, depending upon the nature of the expense.  I have also 
proposed that ENA pay BPUP a $10,000 Consulting Fee to cover any outside 
expenses associated with the drafting and execution of this agreement and the 
site option agreement(s).  The proposed term of the LOI expires 31 December 
2001, unless either of us determines earlier that the joint effort will not 
be successful.  During the term of the LOI, it is proposed that BPUB and ENA 
will determine and agree upon an appropriate Project equity participation and 
finance structure.

Something we may want to consider is the transfer of BPUB's equity in the 
Oklaunion plant in exchange for equity in the new Cameron County plant.  This 
would be especially appealing if BPUB's interest in Oklaunion also included 
switching rights through the nearby DC Tie and if there are additional 
Oklaunion interests available with DC Tie switching rights.  

Please let know a convenient time when we talk through the proposed LOI and 
address any of your questions.

JMoore

Steve is in my office and he agrees with the approach.

Kay:

I have left two messages with Steve Thome but have not heard back from him.
In the meantime, Greg Lang called.  I advised Greg that our tentative
proposal is to pay half (not to exceed $25,000) of the HSR filing fee, but
that this has not yet been approved by Enron.  He balked at the $25,000
maximum, and said he would let his client know.  I am to get back to Greg
when Enron approves a proposal on the issue.

Kay:
 
I advised Greg Lang that Enron had approved our tentative proposal on
splitting the HSR fee, with Enron bearing a maximum of $25k. 
 
Bill Blumenthal (our HSR expert) has now spoken with Dave Burns (Paul
Hastings' HSR expert), and Bill reports back that Mr. Burns now agrees that
there is exposure to an HSR filing requirement upon exercise of the
put/call.  Apparently, Mr. Burns had not previously focused on the transfer
of the remaining 20% interest in the LLC pursuant to the put/call in his
analysis.  They also agree that the filing fee will be determined by the
fair market value of the assets in the LLC at that time.
 
Greg Lang called after his report from his HSR expert and now proposes the
following alternatives:
 
1.  Straight-up 50/50 split of fees (with no $25k maximum on Enron's
contribution), so that the parties are equally incentivized to minimize the
fee; or
 
2.  Draft additional provisions whereby Enron consents in advance to some
structure such that upon exercise of the put/call, the value of the assets
owned by the LLC are as low as possible.  This may involve transferring one
or more of the turbines to another LLC wholly owned by the LLC.  (Greg
thinks that the value of the assets of wholly-owned subsidiaries need not be
included in the threshold calculation, but I have not confirmed this).  I
indicated that this could be viewed by the FTC as a subterfuge for avoiding
filing requirements.  He called back and subsequently advised that the
solution may then involve transferring each of the turbines to a separate
LLC owned 80/20 by PPL and ENA (to be in compliance with GE requirements)
and that Delta would have a business justification for doing this on the
basis of flexibility to put these turbines in various different projects.  
 
Please advise of your thoughts on this issue.  Thank you.

Nancy,

I've made a list of the transactions I see in the VEPCO deal.  Perhaps you 
can think of more.  I would appreciate your suggestions for B & P lawyers to 
assist with these various aspects of the deal, with local counsel input as 
necessary.  Additionally, I would like to have someone in the Houston office 
involved for backup. last minute meetings, etc.

Thanks for your help.

Here's my list:
 
Power Purchase Agreement with Virgina Power (VEPCO)

Interconnection Agreement (VEPCO)

Land option/due diligence/purchase (Electicities)

Sale of land to the City of Rocky Mount (CRM)

Possible Annexation Agreement (CRM)

Payment in Lieu of Taxes Agreement (CRM)

Gas Supply Agreeement (CRM)

Land lease (CRM)

Fuel supply (oil)

EPC Contract (NEPCO or other)

Assignment of turbine contract (GE?)

Purchase of other long lead items

Permitting

Operations and Maintenance Agreement

Hi Carolyn,

I can't recall whether Delta et al have seen a draft of the escrow agreement 
(and instructions) yet?  Is this one in the works?  I suspect GE may want to 
see it in connection with the giving of their consent.

Thanks,

Kay

Hi Pete,

Per my voice mail.

Nice try getting us to sign up for four more.  What a salesman!  I have made 
some changes to reflect the First Amended and Restated  Agreement in 
Principle.  Unless we hear back from you (call Steve) we will sign the 
attached. I am also corrected the dates in the first paragraph of Appendixs C 
to "April 4" . OK?

I had that same version, so I accepted changes and updated to reflect our
current agreement.

Here's a starting point.  I've tried to bracket stuff with open issues like 
this [ ], but I'm sure there are more questions than [ ]s.  I'm really 
unclear on the financial aspect of the deal.  

Reagan, I didn't stop to put the exhibits you sent in, as I thought it was 
better to get the doc in your hands (and Mr. Fairley's) for a detailed review.

I've sent a draft to you and Reagan via email.  There are questions and 
blanks in it. Kay

Will be at FMPA/FT.Pierce meeting in Orlando on Thurs.  Take care and thanks.

David Fairley

Well, don't get too excited until you read it.  There's lots of stuff I just 
had to put place holders on, but we'll get it all filled in.

Wow!  This is big.....remarkable effort.

I don't really like the organization of it much.  I think things need to be 
moved around and re-organized.

Kay,

I have gone through the first 37 pgs and landed on the Energy Mgmt Svcs Agmt 
when it occured to me that I really could use an education on the contract 
structure.  So I am backing up to outline the doc(s) to see how everything 
fits.  Call me when you get a few minutes...I need a lesson.

Kay:
 
I just spoke with Bill Blumenthal (our HSR expert).  He and Paul Hastings'
HSR expert have traded voice mails exchanging information, but have not yet
spoken.  Bill says that Delta is apparently relying on the "ordinary course"
exemption, which may be fine if all the LLC wants to do is hold turbines for
re-sale.  If the LLC works on development of a power plant, the analysis
would be different.  In any event, Bill agrees that the only safe thing to
do is provide now for the possible requirement to file later.
 
Prior to speaking with Bill, I also spoke with Greg Lang.  He agrees that we
should provide now for the possible requirement to file later.  He again
asserted that since this is "Enron's structure," Enron should agree to bear
50% of any filing fee.
 
Steve Thome indicated earlier today that Enron may be willing to bear half
of the filing fee.  Under current regulations, the filing fee will be $45k
if, at the time the put/call is exercised, the assets have a fair market
value of $50-100 million, and the filing fee will be $125k if, at the time
the put/call is exercised, the assets of the LLC have a fair market value of
$100-500 million.  
 
Please let me know whether to advise Greg that Enron will accept
responsibility for half the filing fee.  Thank you.

We have enclosed what we hope is the final draft of the letter agreement
between ENA and PPL, marked to reflect revisions from the prior draft dated
April 3, 2001.  In the event these revisions are acceptable, we have also
enclosed a clean copy for execution.  We would recommend execution in

It may be closer to 630.  Is this still ok?  I'll call first, of course.

Mitch,

Has the letter gone out?  

Kay

If this letter has not yet gone out, we should include the kitchen sink of 
perceived problems. I agree that the letter should be short, but lets 
eliminate their argument that we did not give complete notice.

Mitch,

Here's a first draft.  Please suggest any additional complaints/shortfalls 
which we need to raise.  It is better to be all inclusive than leave 
something out.

Richard, any ideas or comments?

Kay

Hi Lee, 

Pete Thompson is preparing the LV Co Gen break out contract based on the 
version generated last week that you and Bill Williams had agreed to (or so I 
think), but incorporating the AIP stuff where approproiate for the new 
turbines.  We need to have the Delta break out contract signed by April 11th, 
so I'm hoping to have the LV Co Gen contract today or early tomorrow for all 
to review.  That way, you can look at both at the same time, and sign both at 
the same time.  Pretty nifty! 

Thanks,

Kay

Kay,

I fiddled a little with the BPUB LOI.  You can see the redlined changes in 
the attached document.  Kathleen FEDEX'ed two CA orginals to BPUB yesterday 
evening and the plan is for them to sign the CA today, I will then email a 
clean LOI to BPUB and to their outside counsel, Davidson, in 
San Antonio.

JMoore

Hello there,

Here's the LV Co Gen break out contract with the assortment of turbines, 
including the 3 turbines from the new order.  I haven't quite figured out the 
route, but I think this is the correct destination.

Due to the Delta schedule, it would be very helpful to get closure on this 
form by April 10th.

Kay
 Attached please find the latest LV Cogen Turbine Agreement
(second document below), as well as a blackline (first document below)
showing changes made to the March 27 version. I have included Lee's
changes to the performance values in Sections 10.7 and 10.8  In addition
I have made changes to the Maximum Liability, Unit Liability and
Purchase Amounts and payment schedule. For the Guaranteed Delivery
dates, I have used the Ready to Ship Dates contained in the Agreement in
Principle.  To complete the agreement, we will need to insert the date
of execution and Exhibit H-2.

Agreement.DOC>> 
 - DVComparison_WAS_86024_1-WAS_86024_2.DOC
 - LV Cogen Gas Turbine Agreement.DOC

This is the form which needs to be cleaned up.  I may have a cleaned up 
version.  I'll check.

Here you go.  It's pretty specific to the Pastoria contract, but has been 
blessed by Mike Barnas (subject, of course, to GE getting what they want on a 
guaranty!!!  grrrr).

Kay Mann@ENRON

Hi Karen,

Could I get a copy of whatever the latest version is of the GE consent for 
Pastoria?  We have a potential deal coming up to move some frames out of 
TurboPark, so I would like to see the current state-of-the-are version.

Thanks,

Kay

Roger Ondreko left the company (or is leaving soon).  Herman brought Billy

Well, I believe I'll bring something cool, comfortable, and casual.  Or, 
maybe jeans.  I don't have a very large selection, since most of my clothes 
are either work clothes or beyond casual (yard stuff).  I have a couple of 
Hawaiian shirts, so I'll probaly pick one of  those.  Neil will wear shorts 
and probably a Hawaiian shirt, since that is what he almost always wears when 
he isn't working!

What do you want to do about lunch tomorrow?  I can bring something, or we 
can just tell Mom we ate on the way.  You know how she frets about such 
things.  Or, we could pick up Sonic if someone is hungry.  We'll have some 
type  of snacks for Michael, I guess, since he's at the age where he eats 
constantly.

HMMMM.  More to think about!

WOW!

Who would have thought that you could get food like this in Palacios??????
It sounds delicious. What are you guys bringing to wear to dinner? I was
thinking nice shorts or something like that?

Cake's in the oven. I think Bobby has a computer working for the Pink House.
I think we will be ready to go in the morning.

I'll call you when we leave.

They have a financing out in the letter agreement.  We have to use 
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver GE consents, but I don't recall 
anything about in other financing docs.

Is someone in the dept designated as the opinion reviewer?

I guess I'm not sure I know what's in the letter agreement.  If it's a done 
deal, I'd say no or at least maybe.  We only give due authority opinions and 
we try to narrow our obligations to lenders under Consent Agreements

so here 'tis.

Thanks,

Kay-attached is the LLC Agreement compared against the draft we originally
sent to NorthWestern (as opposed to the draft sent to us by its counsel).

Hi again,

I just called Mom and told her our plans.  She says Dad has no clue.  She 
vacuumed on Monday or Tuesday, and he asked her who she was expecting to 
visit the next day. HA HA HA.

I told her that we are all very proud of ourselves for not blowing it.  

Dad doesn't know I called today, so I can call him tomorrow when we are on 
the way, talk to Mom and let her know when we will be there.  It won't be 
that weird for me to call on a Saturday morning.  She say Larry and Beverly 
left today, so we can park in their driveway and be sneaky.  

I'm so excited!!!

Okay.  My exit strategy didn't work and I got these back.  Lee said to ask
you to send to me the Salmon Facility Agreement.  Is this the same as Delta.

Also, what other documents will we have here.  Will there be any override
letters, assignments, consents (other than below)?  

Do I have any hope of getting out of the opinion.  What good is an in-house
attorney's opinion anyway.  It may be a stumbling block as we've never given
one before and I don't know how long approval procedures may take.

Are the documents below up to date.

Too fun!!

Kent

Hi Kent,

I don't know whether Lee has mentioned the Delta Power deal that we are
working on.  We are taking 4 turbines and putting them in an LLC, and
selling some of the interest in the LLC to Delta Power.  Three of the
turbines are turbines formerally known as LV Co Gen turbines, and we are
buying new LM's to replace the ones we are using here.  In any event, Delta
Power is financing the deal, and they have asked that we get GE sign off on
the attached documents.  Therefore, I would be interested in your response
to the attached.

I understand that Lee is in New Orleans today, but I'll send him a copy
anyway.

The balance due to GE is being escrowed at closing, with standing 
instructions to release payments to GE on a fixed payment schedule.  I will 
email you the current draft of the instructions.

Kay:

This financing transaction is much more "involved" than others. I know
nothing about Pegasus Power or Salmon.  What comfort are we getting that we
will get paid.  Is there an LOC in place.  Are there guarantees to back up
these debt financing.  Is GE secured in preference to this debt.

Hi Reagan,

Could you locate, cut and paste and email me the definition of "native load" 
from the Entergy tariff?

I need the location of the interconnection for the defn of delivery point.

Aren't we missing some time in the defns of On/Off Peak that you gave me.  
Aren't 2 hours missing?  Is on/off peak an everyday thing, or seasonal?

What are we going to do about defining profit (and costs)?

Do we need to give a place for meetings, and if so, where should these 
meetings be? (13 c).

More to come...

Thanks,

to give them any room to wiggle. We can always send another notice later.

I would include reference to two (2) major issues, the one stated on the unit 
non-performance at varying ambient temperatures and second being excessive 
vibration.  The rest of the letter looks fine.

Not yet.  I wanted to wrap up the repairs on unit 1 first to see if we should

I feel puny now,  but maybe I'll feel better later.

How do you feel about making Enron an advisory member of the Marketing 
Committee?  I'm concerned that we will run afoul of Miss law regarding 
control.  Would this create a problem for us?

Kay

Big hole in the doc without the profit stuff.  Any ideas?

I'm sure Friday will work well.  It should be quiet at work since it will be 
Good Friday.

I know your pictures will be spectacular.

suzanneadams@att.net on 04/09/2001 10:22:32 AM
Kay, I just talked to Dan and told him we were both 
puny.  We have tentatively rescheduled for Friday.  How 
does that look for you?  He said to PLEASE hurry and get 
well. I feel so needed!

Oh, we went to Brenham and shot some bluebonnet pics 
yesterday.  I hope they come out good.  Linda Simmons 
has been requesting them for a while now.  Did you see 
the Masters golf tournament. Tiger won and it was 
exciting.  I never thought I would actually like 
watching golf.  

Get to feeling better!

Christi is the one who told me to ask you about native load since you have 
the tariff.  Small world.

This is getting tricky.  We could ask Oz but I wouldn't want to upset DF.  It 
just seems like a big deal to leave out of the draft.  

Kay

tick, tick, tick.............I am waiting on Fairley...and getting nervous.

RE:  the delivery point--we should reference the valid MDEA interconnection 
point as defined in the Interconnect Operating Agreement. 

RE: native load--I am getting with Christi, more later.
Big hole in the doc without the profit stuff.  Any ideas?

my printer just froze, and I want to look at the doc to finish the 
reorganization.  Could you pretty please fax me the first 14 pages (I have 
the last).  Also, could you look at the stuff I've highlighted in yellow.  

I haven't put all your comments in, but I will in a minute.  Don't get 
discouraged, the draft is closer to finished than it looks, it is just the 
changes are in my head.  It won't take too terribly long now.

I've set up the exhibits as a separate document to make it easier to move 
around the doc.

I think it would be kind of strange to send a draft without the most basic of 
commercial terms included.  Stranger things have happened of course!

Many thanks.

Kay

I heard Pat Radford is leaving, and you know Bob Carter is leaving, right?

I don't feel as bad as I did when I woke up.  My face hurt so badly.  Neil 
was so sweet bringing me hot washcloths.  It really helped. I'm running a low 
grade fever, and I know it is a sinus infection.  I took a really hot shower 
around 5 this morning, but it didn't help much.  Advil helped!  I spent a lot 
of time outside yesterday, and I'm paying for it.

suzanneadams@att.net on 04/09/2001 12:09:28 PM
Yes, I knew about both of them.  You know I have my 
sources to keep me informed as to what's going on.  I 
figured Bob Carter would leave.  It was just a feeling.  
I guess Sheila will have to replace him and Al Larsen in 
Portland.  I bet she's a crazy woman.

Oh, you should see the roots on my hair!  I'm so glad 
I'm getting it done on Thursday!  I look like a skunk!  
Thank goodness my hair is curly!!!!!  I was thinking 
about putting on some makeup to go to the doctor, but I 
think not.  I'll do good to get my hair dry!  I'm 
feeling tired today, but maybe it's because I didn't 
sleep all that well last night.  I've been so hot lately 
and having nightsweats.  What fun getting older is!

Are you feeling any better?

> I heard Pat Radford is leaving, and you know Bob Carter is leaving, right?

I figured you knew, but I thought I'd better be certain.  I'm wondering about 
Bart, too.  Bob said he (Bob) is getting a nice raise, and I heard he got a 
signing bonus.  Oh, I heard it from Dan,, so you probably know.   

Are they looking for someone to replace Pat?  I like Glenn, the temp on 31 
who was working for Ben.  I don't know his skills, but he is great on the 
phone.

This is a BIG deal!
Current negotiations with AALLP has provided us " a new look " at the current 
lease model.  It has loosened up somewhat to our benefit.  AALLP has agreed 
to a "two bucket" approach as indicated on the attached matrix.  Note that we 
may operate under this model until the EITF provides definitive guidance 
which is expected in December 2001.  

We should now focus on the O&M aspect of an existing or development project.  

If we pass bucket one as it relates to O&M and offtake limits of 95% or less, 
we will not be in a lease and do not proceed to bucket 2.  Bucket two is 
essentially where we have been up to now.  

In a nutshell, if Enron does not operate, does not have the ability to hire 
and fire the operator (must have less than 50% voting on this), does not set 
or approve operating policies and procedures and takes 95% or less of the 
offtake, we should not be in a lease and we stop there.  If we supply the 
fuel and take 95% or less of the offtake and pass O&M criteria, the fuel 
supply agreement must have significant LD's.  See specifics for Bucket 1 on 
the attached.

NOTE:  Please keep us in the loop on new deals as we roll out this new 
model.  We still need to scrub the deals in order to keep AALLP informed.

Please distribute to those I have missed.

Hi Carolyn,

GE has asked for an explanation of the relationship of Pegasus to Delta Power 
(in other words, the equity structure).  Could you please ask Greg if DP can 
send an email with that explanation, so that I can pass it along to GE.

No.  I'll have Neil check (he does all that stuff).

and will get them to you.  Have you checked to see if the checks cleared the

I think I'll just take off until you get back!

I went to the doctor today for my checkup, and he said I 
was doing good (a very fast healer).  However, he still 
wants me to take it easy for a couple more weeks.  
Therefore, he's released me to return to work on Monday, 
April 30!  I'll be ready!!!!!!!

I checked with Chris earlier today and he hadn't heard anything.  The ball is 
clearly in their court, so I guess we just stand by.

I plan on being back in the office tomorrow.  Talk to you then,

Kay

Heard you were ill-sorry to hear that.  I haven't heard a thing re Blue Dog.
Have you?  Tick tock, tick tock.

hovering.

Boy, you sure know how to make me feel good!  Sheila 
said she was so sad I wouldn't be back until the 30th.  
The doc said my abs were good and tight, but I can't do 
any ab work until one more month.  Wait until you see 
me, I'm a shadow of my former self with all that 
swelling gone.  I feel so much better.  I can't eat very 
much any more either.  I can drink though!!!!!!!!!

Well, if you aren't going to work until I get back, then 
you need to come over and we can go hang out!!!! 
Wouldn't that be a hoot!

I've redline the Salmon contract for Exhibits A and B, Purchase Amount,

Stabilizer has been struck from scope, because I can recall Bill Williams
advising that LV would need them, Delta/Salmon would not.  That's consitent

CC,

Do you still have the contact info for the escrow agent?  If so, it would be  
great it you would contact them directly.

The turbine contract is going back and forth between us and GE.  I expect 
that it may well be ready tomorrow.

I expect the Enron opinion letter to be an issue.

Kay

Kay:

Note the following timetable from the final version of the ENA/PPL letter
agreement:

(1)  ENA agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the final
form of the turbine contract on or before April 11, 2001.
(2)  The parties agreed to commercially reasonable efforts to execute an
escrow agreement on or before April 16, 2001.
(3)  The escrow account must be funded 3 business days after the later of
(a) ENA's delivery of the final form of the turbine contract and (b) the
closing of PPL's financing.
(4)  ENA can terminate if the escrow is not funded on or before April 19,
2001 (but this date gets pushed back by one business day for each business
day beyond April 11, 2001 that ENA delivers the final form of the turbine
contract).
(5)  The closing occurs at least 5, but not later than 10, business days
after funding the escrow account.
(6)  Either party may terminate if the closing has not occurred on or before
May 3, 2001.

If ENA delivers the final form of the turbine contract on April 11, 2001,
then the April 19, 2001 right to terminate stands.  PPL's obligation to fund
the escrow would then be determined by the date of its loan closing.  Greg
Lang advises that they are working on PPL's financing, but he did not give
an estimated date for financial closing.  

I advised Greg on Friday that the legal opinions from both GE and Enron were
causing heartburn.  He agreed to pass this along to Isabel Parker.  He asked
today about GE's reaction to the consent document and if it would be
appropriate for Isabel Parker to contact GE directly at this point.  He also
requested a draft of the escrow disbursement instructions.  When you get a
chance, please advise of any comments in order that we can circulate for
PPL's review.  Also, we need to contact Citibank to clear the proposed form
of escrow agreement (and the anticipated disbursement instructions) and to
negotiate the fee.  Let me know if we can assist in this regard.  Thanks.

Hi David,

Reagan struck all the references to the Fuel Plan.  

I think the specific obligations would fit nicely in the scope exhibits, but 
we can put the stuff in the body of the contract if that's better for you.  
It just seemed that it would easier to work  with in the exhibits.

Kay

Kay -- Do you want detail about our specific power and gas activity 
obligations in the body of the contract, or in the Marketing Plan?  Is the 
fuel plan included in the Marketing Plan?

Does Bill know this?  Lee is going to want to know that you guys are on the

Bill Williams@ECT

Kay - sorry I have taken so long to review the attachments to your e mail.

I have comments that I would like to address in a conference call with GE 
(Lee Johnson), Peter Thompson of AKLLP (history of changes - especially in 
the guarantees for HR and MW output).
 Basically, the figures for HR and Output should remain as was struck. 
(Trivial - but Lee knows what I have gone through with the EPC contractor on 
HR and MW (kW) guarantees.)
Electrical Output should stay at 43,994 kW rather than change to 43,988 kW. 
Same goes for the specific value, and H/R guarantee (8969 btu/kWh) and 
specific value.
What is really puzzling is when I went back to a December BO contract, I had 
a kW guarantee over 48 MWs each, at an 8800 + HR.  This is with conditions as 
set in the existing version.  Where did the MWs go?

I need to understand the history of changes to the BO contract, and be sure 
we are not leaving value on the table.  That is why Kay, if possible _ I'd 
like a quick conference call that would include the party making the changes 
to HR and MW output guarantees.

Also - I did not see the addition of 4 more HMI's as needed for LVCII.  The 
power system stabilizers were in the scope of supply - but I could not find 
additional HMI's (whatever that entails).

I believe we can knock this out by tomorrow to meet the April 10 date listed 
in your e mail.

Please call me should you have any questions.
Regards

Bill W.

I have spoken to Matt Gockerman in Tax who's comfortable with West LB 
creating a presence in Texas through a partnership owned by Delaware LLCs in 
order to register with the Comptroller prior to receipt of the LM6000 
turbines (which is estimated to be 6/20). Matt will provide the necessary 
forms to West LB/Winston and will coordinate with them for timely completion. 

West LB will be putting together a closing check list for this to occur, 
including registration forms, ADA assignment agreement and West LB guaranty, 
etc. Kay and Rob, can I ask you to coordinate what if anything needs to be on 
the list from the commercial side beside the assignment under LM6000 turbine 
purchase agreement.  We'll schedule a call in the next few days to coordinate 
with Winston and West LB on this matter.

Thanks,
Matt

Chris,

I haven't heard when they expect to have their financing.  We are finishing 
up the break out contract with GE, and assuming we tender it tomorrow, they 
will have until April 19th to fund the escrow.

Steve and Kay,

How are things going with Delta?  I want to push them hard to close.

Regards,

Chris

Sounds like both need to stabilizers.

Kay

   
	
	

Lee  - I agree with your statement that LV needs the PSS.  But not with 
regards to Delta.  I do not know what Delta needs for siting their 
generation.  It is my understanding that generators in the WSCC need PSS's.  
I am trying to locate chapter and verse on that requirement.  It may be a 
size issue (ie - greater than "x" MWs of generator size). Don Hammond will 
help me locate the requirement in the morning, and I will get back to you.  
My concern was your e mails seemed to imply I said Delta doesn't need PSS. I 
want to stay silent on that issue.

In any regard, Nevada Power Co requires PSS, that is the reason we are 
obtaining them for all the generators at LVCII.

contract.

Kent/Kay-

I've redline the Salmon contract for Exhibits A and B, Purchase Amount,
Maximum Liability Amount, and Unit Liability Amount.  The Power System
Stabilizer has been struck from scope, because I can recall Bill Williams
advising that LV would need them, Delta/Salmon would not.  That's consitent
with the other units going to CA (w/ Intergen).

I was referencing your question about power and gas activity obligations when 
I raised the issue of putting it in the exhibits (which we have done pursuant 
to discussions we had last Friday)  My point on the fuel plan  was that 
Reagan deleted it, which was fine with me.  There is language in the contract 
addressing Enron's responsibility to buy gas and fuel oil for the facilities.

Kay

Kay -- The fuel activity is so limited in scope that a separate Exhibit is 
questionable.  If you don't want fuel in the contract body, then why not make 
it a subset of the marketing plan.  Fuel activity is directly linked to power 
marketing when running their units. Thanks -- david

Hi David,

Reagan struck all the references to the Fuel Plan.  

I think the specific obligations would fit nicely in the scope exhibits, but 
we can put the stuff in the body of the contract if that's better for you.  
It just seemed that it would easier to work  with in the exhibits.

Kay

Kay -- Do you want detail about our specific power and gas activity 
obligations in the body of the contract, or in the Marketing Plan?  Is the 
fuel plan included in the Marketing Plan?

Greg Lang called this morning to request financial statements from GE
Packaged Power, Inc.   

FYI - I have spoken with Estelle Lawrence, our contact at Citibank, and she
advises that the process must start with one of their sales representatives.
A sales rep will call me back to get an understanding of the transaction and
provide an estimate of the required fees.  I will let you know.

Team Salmon,

Carlos will be working the Enron consent/opinion docs.  I suspect he is 
looking for a seat at the closing dinner, but the help is appreciated 
regardless of motive.

Carolyn, the form of the escrow instruction letter looked fine.

I spoke with GE about the turbine contract, and I am optimistic that we will 
have the "final form" today.

Ciao,

Kay

fyi
Kay:

Note the following timetable from the final version of the ENA/PPL letter
agreement:

(1)  ENA agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the final
form of the turbine contract on or before April 11, 2001.
(2)  The parties agreed to commercially reasonable efforts to execute an
escrow agreement on or before April 16, 2001.
(3)  The escrow account must be funded 3 business days after the later of
(a) ENA's delivery of the final form of the turbine contract and (b) the
closing of PPL's financing.
(4)  ENA can terminate if the escrow is not funded on or before April 19,
2001 (but this date gets pushed back by one business day for each business
day beyond April 11, 2001 that ENA delivers the final form of the turbine
contract).
(5)  The closing occurs at least 5, but not later than 10, business days
after funding the escrow account.
(6)  Either party may terminate if the closing has not occurred on or before
May 3, 2001.

If ENA delivers the final form of the turbine contract on April 11, 2001,
then the April 19, 2001 right to terminate stands.  PPL's obligation to fund
the escrow would then be determined by the date of its loan closing.  Greg
Lang advises that they are working on PPL's financing, but he did not give
an estimated date for financial closing.  

I advised Greg on Friday that the legal opinions from both GE and Enron were
causing heartburn.  He agreed to pass this along to Isabel Parker.  He asked
today about GE's reaction to the consent document and if it would be
appropriate for Isabel Parker to contact GE directly at this point.  He also
requested a draft of the escrow disbursement instructions.  When you get a
chance, please advise of any comments in order that we can circulate for
PPL's review.  Also, we need to contact Citibank to clear the proposed form
of escrow agreement (and the anticipated disbursement instructions) and to
negotiate the fee.  Let me know if we can assist in this regard.  Thanks.

Good Morning Margaret,

I wanted to get your permission to come in by 9a.m. this Friday, April 13, 
2001.  I have been asked to preach that morning for my church's Passion 
Service.  Passion Service begins at 6a.m.  I should be up preaching by 6:45.  
It is very possible that I could be finished around 8a.m.  However, just in 
case things move slow, I may need the 9a.m time.  Passion Service reflects 
the crucifixion, death, and burial of Jesus Christ.

Please advise me.

Thanks in advance, Warren.

John,

The fax is coming in as we speak.  Guess it takes a while to fax it to all 
those addresses.

reason to kirk the whole clan for that experience.

anything about in other financing docs.

Is someone in the dept designated as the opinion reviewer?

I guess I'm not sure I know what's in the letter agreement.  If it's a done 
deal, I'd say no or at least maybe.  We only give due authority opinions and 
we try to narrow our obligations to lenders under Consent Agreements

FPL, Entergy Merge in $7 Billion Deal 
NEW YORK (Reuters) - FPL Group Inc., the parent of Florida Power & Light Co., 
said on Monday it would merge with Entergy Corp. in a stock deal worth $7 
billion to create the largest U.S. power generating company. 
The combined company would have a total enterprise value of more than $27 
billion, consisting of $16.4 billion in equity market capitalization and 
$10.7 billion in debt and preferred stock, the companies said. 
The merger is expected to immediately boost earnings for both companies. 
Under the terms of the agreement, FPL shareholders would receive one share of 
a new holding company for each FPL share held. Entergy shareholders would get 
0.585 of a share of the new holding company for each Entergy share. 
Based on the companies' closing stock prices, the deal would value Entergy at 
its market value of $7 billion, or about $30.89 per share. FPL shares closed 
Friday at 52-13/16, off a year high of 56-5/8 but up from a low of 36-3/8. 
Entergy stock ended at 30-5/16, off a high of 31-3/16 but up from a low of 
15-15/16. 
SHAREHOLDERS' APPROVAL REQUIRED 
The combination must be cleared by shareholders as well as federal 
regulators. FPL and Entergy said they hope to complete the transaction within 
15 months. 
``The merger combines two strategically aligned, financially healthy 
companies into an organization that has no equal in the industry,'' said J. 
Wayne Leonard, Entergy chief executive. 
Leonard will serve as president and chief executive of the combined company 
while FPL's chief executive, James Broadhead, will serve as chairman. 
The deal was billed as a merger of equals but gives FPL shareholders 57 
percent of the combined company and eight of 15 seats on the board of 
directors, the companies said. 
Once combined, the new company is expected to see annual cost savings of $110 
million to $150 million in its regulated businesses derived from eliminating 
duplicate corporate and administrative positions and programs. 
Competitive businesses should see annual cost savings and revenue 
enhancements of $40 million to $125 million and capital expenditure savings 
of $50 million to $100 million, the companies said. 
FPL and Entergy said they will seek to ``minimize workforce effects of the 
merger'' through a variety of unidentified efforts. 
In addition, both FPL and Entergy have authorized stock buyback plans, 
together worth $1 billion. FPL plans to repurchase $570 million shares while 
Entergy is looking to buy back $430 million in stock, the companies said. 

Of course, this doesn't apply to any funds held in a jointly owned  bank or 
trust account, right?  And when you say "do not", what do you mean?  Does 
that mean do or does it mean not?  You are confusing me. What does "is" mean, 
after all?

As I'm sure you recall, Bob Vote handled the last one.  Richard Sanders is 
the EWS litagation manager, so Mark would probably like for him to know about 
it.  Richard seems decent.

EECC has just been served with a writ of garnishment from the 333rd Judicial 
District Court of Harris County  in connection with a judgment against 
certain CIGSA entities. In the writ, the court very unambiguously and very 
plainly commands that EECC is not to pay any debt or deliver any property to 
CIGSA pending further orders from  the court. The writ was issued to enforce 
an judgment  for $1.3 million awarded by the court against CIGSA in favor of 
Richard P Estrada. EECC is also commanded to appear before the court and list 
all funds/assets in our possession that might belong to CIGSA,  and to 
disclose what other persons we know ofif any, that might have such funds or 
assets.  The lawyer for Mr. Estrada is the same lawyer who successfully 
garnished EECC in the past to collect sums owed other CIGSA judgment 
creditors. 

Please take this prohibition as applying even to cases where CIGSA might be 
entitled to the money or the property under our contracts with them, or where 
the funds or property are in joint venture acounts or custody in the US or 
Mexico until we have had a chance to review matters in detail and make a more 
accurate assessment. In the meantime, effective immediately, do not make ANY 
payments to or on behalf of, or release ANY property to or on behalf of, any 
CIGSA entity without first obtaining legal department approval. The court may 
impose penalties for violations  of its garnishment order.

We will assemble an appropriate litigation team to work onthis matter. Randy 
Pais will be handling this for EEOS legal. I suggest that Mike Pearson and 
Mark Brand get the word out to the Project Management and Project Control 
teams on  this matter ASAP.

this little note, but of course I am fighting the last war now, aren't I? (we 
won, but it killed us. we had to destroy the company to save it)

I have a 300 meeting, so I'm sending this as is so that David can print a 
copy.  I have not yet integrated all of his changes, although I have dealt 
with the profit/savings and QSE.

Is the scope of scheduling services in the exhibit the same as the Scheduling 
(aka QSE) stuff?  

Later,

Kay

ps Reagan has the latest exhibits.

When we were part of Julia's group, waivers of consequentials in CA's were 
not standard. I don't know if this was due to an ENA policy (doubtful).

 If we are the one giving important information, we shouldn't want to waive 
it automatically, because consequentials will be the most likely result of 
the other party's breach. Therefore, in unilateral agreements where we are 
giving the info, I wouldn't want the waiver.  In the reciprocals it would 
depend on the circumstance.  If the other party is doing most of the sharing, 
I would want it.

What say you, Carlos?

Kay

   
	
	

I am going to add this to our forms of CA's, okay?

for any indirect, special, consequential, punitive or other delay-related or 
performance-related damages including, without limitation, lost earnings, 
production or profits allegedly caused by any claim or action, whether it is 
based in whole or in part on contract, negligence, strict liability, tort, 
statutory or any other theory of liability.

K-

Wow.  I wonder how long it will take for me to get a good handle on this 
stuff?

Thanks,

Kay

   
	
	

some comments

A.  1st sentence --Remove "a" before dual fuel.  Change delivers to deliver
"Costs"  (xi)  Add "SPP or" before "Serc-imposed
"Protocols"  I don't think there are SERC Protocols (this may be from ERCOT 
agreement).
"Serc ISO"  There is not such thing yet.
"SPP"  Add "Reliability" after Electric

Here is the latest.

Let's see if I can attach it this time.

I have a few comments from our finance folks which I am reviewing now.

Kay

Attached please find the latest LV Cogen Turbine Agreement (second
document below), as well as a blackline (first document below) showing
changes made to the version circulated on April 5. The only changes are
to the performance guarantees in Sections 10.7 and 10.8.  To complete
the agreement, we will need to insert the date of execution and Exhibit
H-2.
 <<Comparison of LV Cogen Agreement - Versions 2 to 3.DOC>>  <<LV Cogen
Gas Turbine Agreement - Version 3.DOC>> 
 - Comparison of LV Cogen Agreement - Versions 2 to 3.DOC
 - LV Cogen Gas Turbine Agreement - Version 3.DOC

Cool.

Believe it or not, they have not mentioned an extension.  They figure we can 
sign on Friday.  

When do you want to talk?

Kay

Kay:

I'd like to talk through the points below so I can make sure I understand the 
issues. By the way, I did not agree to anything with Michael, in fact I told 
him it was easier to not include any change order provisions. Have they asked 
for an extension yet?

Regards,

Ben
Chris and Ben:

Since Kay is tied up on a 3:00 conference call, she asked me to summarize
the issues raised by Marguerite's latest mark-ups.  The issues are as
follows:

1. In Section 6(h) regarding the Change Order, Marguerite has added a rider
pursuant to which ENA would be required "to cause the Original Purchaser
and/or the Agent to use commercially reasonable efforts to afford NorSub (or
its agent or representative), upon request of NorSub, such opportunity or
opportunities to discuss with GE (or to consult with GE concerning) such
matters pertaining to the Turbines and/or the Original Turbine Contract as
NorSub desires to discuss with GE (or to consult with GE concerning) and
which GE is obligated under the Original Turbine Contract to discuss with
(or concerning which GE is obligated under the Original Turbine Contract to
consult with) the Purchaser and/or Agent thereunder; provided, however, that
each of ENA, the Original Purchaser and the Agent shall have the right to be
present at, and to participate in, each such discussion (or consultation."
According to Jerry DeBerry, Michael Young raised this concept with Ben, and
Ben accepted it in principle.  Please confirm if you are okay with this
rider going into the Letter Agreement.

2.  In Section 8(a), Marguerite has added a clause whereby ENA agrees to be
responsible for, and to pay GE when due, and to hold the LLC and NorSub
harmless from any damages or indemnification payments which become due and
payable to GE on and after the Closing Date as a result of any event
occurring, or any circumstance arising, prior to the Closing Date.  Since
this provision effectively shifts the Change Order risk onto ENA, Kay
suggests that we only accept the provision if a reciprocal provision is
included that allows ENA to terminate the agreement as a result of any event
or circumstance that increases the Purchase Amount.  Do you agree?

3.  Finally, with respect to the LLC Agreement, NorthWestern would like to
be able to exercise its call rights with relative freedom while forcing ENA
to wait until Takeover or 12/31/02 before being able to exercise its put
rights.  Neither Jerry nor Marguerite understands why ENA cares when
NorthWestern takes ENA out.

Jerry and Marguerite were working on scheduling a conference call for
sometime tomorrow, so I will send you an e-mail confirming the details as
soon as I hear back from them.

Best regards,

Marisa     

Michael,

We (Enron and outside counsel) have not received any documents either faxed
or via e-mail as of Tuesday morning.  Once we receive the documents, we
would like time to review the comments before we engage in a conference
call.  Please either resend the documents to Kay Mann, John Keffer and
myself.

Regards,

Chris

Chris, in case Kay is not in today, I provide this to you.  Please forward
to Ben at your earliest convenience.  Thanks.
We have forwarded to you via facsimile our comments to the Letter Agreement
and the LLC Agreement. The majority of our comments, as you will note, are
intended to clarify the understanding of the parties with respect to the
various matters set forth in such documents and are not intended to "change
the deal". Except that, upon the advise of our tax counsel, we have
adjusted the amounts of the promissory notes to be issued in connection
with the transaction in order to maximize the LLC's basis in the Turbines.
We believe this is consistent with your initial draft of the Letter
Agreement.

Also, please note that we have included additional language in Section 6 of
the Letter Agreement which provides NorthWestern with the opportunity to
consult with GE on matters relating to the Turbines. This reflects our
understanding of an agreement that had been reached among the parties.

With respect to the LLC Agreement, we would like to discuss with you the
following: (i) the timing of the exercise of the Call Right and (ii) the
intent of your proposed language in Section 7 relating to the rights of
each Member to act in its own best interests with respect to the Call and
Put Rights.  To that end, we propose scheduling a conference call on
Tuesday afternoon, April 11, 2001.  Please contact me as soon as possible
with a time that is convenient for your team.

We look forward to hearing from you.

Note: We will forward to you shortly, revised drafts of the documents for
which we have drafting responsibility.

Scott,

Carlos Sole' is supporting Mitch and John's efforts relating to BPUB, ie, 
coal fired generation.  Any contracts for that effort should be coordinated 
through Carlos.  Carlos will assist with the coordination of the finance and 
accounting requirements.  Due to the complexity of the issues some lead time 
is necessary.  Unfortunately, there are no "forms" for generation projects 
(given accounting/finance requirements), or any assurance that a contract 
that worked a month ago will work now. 

My preference is that contracts not be sent to counterparties prior to ENA 
(or EECC) Legal review.

Thanks,

Kay

Scott,

Please find attached below a copy of the Amendment 2 and Transmittal letter 
that I just sent to Burns & Roe today as well as an electronic copy of their 
PSA Agreement.  Hard copies are in interoffice mail.

I am also attaching the latest standard Tasking Letter form for work being 
done for EECC.  If work is to be done for another Enron entity, an affiliate 
Tasking Letter for would be used.  Bart Clark has used the Tasking Letter 
form on an exception basis for Turbo Park projects; however, ENA needs to 
review the language within the Tasking Letter prior to execution to ensure 
that it conforms to the accounting requirements of off balance sheet 
financing.  You need to ensure that an ENA attorney has reviewed everything 
prior to your sending it out because one error in a contract could cause the 
entire project to be put on the balance sheet.

Let me know if you need anything else.

I am also copying those ENA attorneys which you mentioned were assisting with 
the Coal Initiative so that they have the opportunity to review and comment 
on this Agreement and how it relates to that project.

Hey Rob, it's like deja vu all over again. 

You know, I tried to put spot lights and alarm sirens in the e-mail this 
time, but this should do it.  God save the fool that sends CIGSA money after 
this little note, but of course I am fighting the last war now, aren't I? (we 
won, but it killed us. we had to destroy the company to save it)

EECC has just been served with a writ of garnishment from the 333rd Judicial 
District Court of Harris County  in connection with a judgment against 
certain CIGSA entities. In the writ, the court very unambiguously and very 
plainly commands that EECC is not to pay any debt or deliver any property to 
CIGSA pending further orders from  the court. The writ was issued to enforce 
an judgment  for $1.3 million awarded by the court against CIGSA in favor of 
Richard P Estrada. EECC is also commanded to appear before the court and list 
all funds/assets in our possession that might belong to CIGSA,  and to 
disclose what other persons we know ofif any, that might have such funds or 
assets.  The lawyer for Mr. Estrada is the same lawyer who successfully 
garnished EECC in the past to collect sums owed other CIGSA judgment 
creditors. 

Please take this prohibition as applying even to cases where CIGSA might be 
entitled to the money or the property under our contracts with them, or where 
the funds or property are in joint venture acounts or custody in the US or 
Mexico until we have had a chance to review matters in detail and make a more 
accurate assessment. In the meantime, effective immediately, do not make ANY 
payments to or on behalf of, or release ANY property to or on behalf of, any 
CIGSA entity without first obtaining legal department approval. The court may 
impose penalties for violations  of its garnishment order.

We will assemble an appropriate litigation team to work onthis matter. Randy 
Pais will be handling this for EEOS legal. I suggest that Mike Pearson and 
Mark Brand get the word out to the Project Management and Project Control 
teams on  this matter ASAP.

I'm back.  Last night my little boy was sick, so I guess it was a virus.  I

Have you made it back into the office today?  Just checking on the CA.

Thanks!

Welcome back.  I know you are probably really busy.  

Paige will be coming home on Thursday.  I told her we might not be leave for 
PH until Saturday.  I want Michael to be able to go to the Easter egg hunt 
here if he wants to.  I don't know Paige's plans beyond Thursday.

Since you've been out of town so much, would it help if I took off Friday so 
that you can catch up?  That still leaves Monday.  

Glad you are back!

burns & roe - greetings.

our understanding is that our current PSA with you has lapsed.
however, ms. renee alfaro has sent an extension letter to extend that PSA.
at this time, enron's position is that we are unable to use the 
lapsed/extended PSA for work on the coal initiative - i.e., accounting rule 
requirements.

however, we'll be sending you soon a cc of a PSA that is compliant with our 
off-balance sheet accounting requirements.  plz stay tuned.

but, in the interim, let's get started on the "short fuse" request for info 
from enron using just a tasking letter with a not-to-exceed without prior 
approval price of $10,000 and a commitment from enron to pay said related 
invoice(s).

attached is a copy of the tasking letter that we discussed on the phone.  plz 
sign, date and return fax this tasking letter back to me.  upon receipt, i'll 
sign, date and fax you back a record copy.

plz call with any questions.

regards.  scott.

Hi Wilson,

I haven't forgotten you, I just got tied up.  

This is a very preliminary draft, but thought you should take a look at it.  
I don't need a detailed analysis, I just want you to have it so that we can 
discuss the impact of Mississippi law.

I am specifically interested in discussing the following:

waivers of consequential damages, limitations of liability

legal status of MDEA (I'll send you the info of what I have)

dispute resolution and jurisdiction

restrictions on confidentiality restrictions

any other aspects of the agreement impacted by Mississippi law

I don't need any memos, just a discussion.

Thanks,

that Enron is still working on them.

Kent/Kay-

I've redline the Salmon contract for Exhibits A and B, Purchase Amount,
Maximum Liability Amount, and Unit Liability Amount.  The Power System
Stabilizer has been struck from scope, because I can recall Bill Williams
advising that LV would need them, Delta/Salmon would not.  That's consitent
with the other units going to CA (w/ Intergen).

Michael tried to push the envelope this am.  He wanted to eat some more after 
he had brushed his teeth (I told him breakfast was over, so no more food) and

Thanks for writing - I deleted your message and then hopped on another 
conference call.  How about 330?

Kay:

Per my voice mail, Greg Lang wanted to schedule a call for 3:00 central time
today to raise something that the lenders brought up.  Please advise if you
are available, or if not, what time would be convenient later today.  Greg
says it should be a 15 minute call.  Thanks.

This is the first of two emails I'm sending you.  Lee revised the Salmon 
contract you did, and now it needs to be "unrevised" in these ways.

Kay
Kay:

I'm on the phone with Lee and he agrees that we need to put the stabilizer
back in.

This will change the various amounts, I think, as follows:

Unit Liability Amount:  14,103,675
Maximum Liability Amount:  56,414,700
Purchase Amount:  50,785,900

The rest of the document is okay.  We are still waiting for the lender docs
back but don't expect any show stoppers.  Lee will be back in the office
tomorrow and can sign documents (if the agreements are okay), and date
effective today if that is a requirement for Enron.

Otherwise, we'll wait for your instructions.

Kent

Me again.

Here's the version I referenced in my earlier email.  I believe we need to
restore the stabilizer stuff, but I wanted to get agreement.

Thanks,

Kay

Kent/Kay-

I've redline the Salmon contract for Exhibits A and B, Purchase Amount,
Maximum Liability Amount, and Unit Liability Amount.  The Power System
Stabilizer has been struck from scope, because I can recall Bill Williams
advising that LV would need them, Delta/Salmon would not.  That's consitent
with the other units going to CA (w/ Intergen).

Hi Ben,

The conference call went fine with NorthWestern.  They really want to get 
their hands on the contract and the change orders.  I told them you were 
talking to GE about it, and we will get them the contract ASAP.

Here are the issues:

If we terminate due to their default, they want the additional $5m to be 
liquidated damages (ie, our exclusive remedy).

They still want the right to talk to GE, specifically about the terms of the 
assignment to the LLC if we are having difficulty getting GE consent.

They want to be able to exercise their call (or take an assignment) of the 
turbine contract earlier.  They are willing to take the risk with the GE 
warranties.  This is a relationship issue.  It is also their biggest issue.

On an interesting note, Intergen wants you to sign a consent to the transfer 
of all the equipment to Sweetgum. Do you know if Lee knows about this?  

Ciao,

Kay

This is preliminary.  I'm supposed to get with our finance folks tomorrow to 
get it finished.  This is ok to send to NW with that understanding.

Kay

Good morning.

Please call these folks and see if you can set up a meeting of the East 
Development team either Tuesday or Wednesday:

Ann Elizabeth White

The meeting shouldn't last more than 45 minutes.  Please reserve us a 
conference room on this floor.

Thanks,

I think Lima would make a great bobble head.  You better get there early.

I received an email from Alfons telling me he was resigning from Technip.  
I'm clueless why he sent it to me.  Talked to Gerry last week.  He says he is 
going to put his Kingwood house on the market.  Hmm.  I hear lots of the old 
gang is working with him now.

Have you gone to your reunion yet?  How was it?

Gotta go home but I didn't want to not write back today.  Hope you find all 
your Easter eggs.

see if we need to be aware of any issues in the contract. Do you have a 
copy?  If not, I can probably get a copy from EECC. 

Thanks,

Nothing from Ben yet.  If I don't hear from him in the next couple of hours, 
then I think we should be ready with an extension letter, giving them a 
couple of days extra for free.  Ben indicated to  me last week that he would 
give them some time once they asked.

MK called with questions on the assignment - nothing serious.

Just in time for the weekend.

I hope to take tomorrow off, by the way.  Paige is coming in tonight, and

Kay,

I spoke with Jake and Lee about the payment schedule.  Lee currently is happy 
to give us 6% to repay everything on 15 May.  I told him we were shooting for 
the end of April, but he is attempting to maintain some continuity with the 
existing payment schedule.  We can probably push him to get it earlier.  

Jake is a little unhappy with 6%.

Steve

Me again.  I forgot to ask you to look at 4.7, 8.3 and article 6 of the LLC 
agreement.  Just want to check.

Kay
Kay:

Attached please find revised copies of the LLC Agreement and Letter
Agreement that are marked to show the changes that we have made to Paul

 Ben,

We are waiting for the insurance information necessary to perform a risk
mitigation analysis. The insurance report received  indicates that their
position is that only a partial repair is necessary. Siemens Westinghouse's
position is that a complete repair is required to restore design reliability
and operational capabilities. A budgetary estimate to perform the required
repairs has been submitted to Enron.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

I may take Michael to the hunting show or movie (Thomas the Tank Engine).
You are welcome to join us. NM

Hi.

I'm kinda tired this morning.  I guess I just need a bit more sleep.

Michael tried to push the envelope this am.  He wanted to eat some more
after he had brushed his teeth (I told him breakfast was over, so no more
food) and wanted to go back in to get a toy to take (nope).  He handled the
frustration ok.

Do we have anything planned this weekend?

With respect to the Northwestern transaction, I'd like to understand what it 
would take in the letter agreement to allow us to recognize the entire $8MM 
upon execution of the letter agreement. In my conversation today with Kay, we 
talked about making sure we could at least recognize the $8MM in equal 
instalments between the execution of the letter agreement and September 1, 
2001 (the outside date for closing). If at all possible, I'd like to take 
this one step further so that the entire amount could be recognized in Q2. 
Let's plan to talk about this on Monday. Any thoughts on this prior to Monday

Kay:

E-mail delivery sounds fine.  Per the letter agreement, we need to submit
the final form of the Turbine Contract and a blacklined version of same
reflecting changes from the form attached to the letter agreement.   I have
assumed that the version to be attached to the letter agreement is the
version #3 that you sent by e-mail on April 3 @12:45 to Greg Lang et al., a=
s
I believe this was the last draft circulated prior to execution of the
letter agreement.

Would you prefer to send these documents to Greg directly or would you like
for me to handle this?  It appears that the blackline attached to this
e-mail is the appropriate blackline (comparison of version 3 to version 4),
so please confirm and let me know if you would like me to send those
documents along to Greg.  Our transmittal will officially reference that
"pursuant to Section 4(b) of the Letter Agreement, we have enclosed...."

Please advise as to handling.  Thanks.

This triggers Delta's obligation to fund the escrow, which now must occur on 
or before April 20.  If they get their financing in order, it will fund 
sooner. Therefore, Carlos is working on the drafts of TurboPark documents.

I would go with Sheila's approach.  I don't see a reason not to.

Kay

Lender's counsel indicated to Caroline that not getting an opinion letter may 
be acceptable, but it needs to be confirmed.  As for the consent agreement, 
the one pending issue is whether we will consent to jurisdiction somewhere in 
connection with actions involving the consent agreement.  Sheila's edits to 
the document had venue in NY federal court but eliminated the text concerning 
waiver of forum non-conveniens defense.  We did not present that but rather 
argued against it in its entirety.  Lender's counsel worked on another deal 
in which we allegedly agreed to jurisdiction in Delaware.  Need your views on 
how to address this issue, Kemosabe.  You can do so via email or we can wait 
until Monday.  Happy Easter and I'll be in tomorrow.

I have some folks who want to option some land in New York.  Do we have a 
company for New York yet?  If not, I seem to recall that we were going to 
start using one of the existing companies for land options instead of 
creating a new one every time.  Am I remembering that correctly?  

Basically I'm looking for the company name to use in an option.  Any 
suggestions?

Thanks,

Kay

I think this will change a bit, but it gives you some history.

We had our daily phone call with NW.  I don't know that we really have 
significant  points of disagreement.  They understand that we are working 
some accounting issues, and they have a general idea of what we want to do.  
I suggested that we come up with the work arounds with our accountants, and I 
will think about it this weekend.  I have a couple of ideas but I really want 
to mull it over.

They look forward to receiving the turbine contract.  Chris, could you 
forward the draft change orders with it?

One point they raised is that they want the ability (with GE consent) to have 
us refund the future payment due to GE (less 7% for time value of money), 
retaining the payment obligation.  All of this is post closing.  They are 
putting up a full blown parent guaranty to GE for the turbine contract, and 
since the payment should only be around $4mm, that would probably be 
acceptable to GE.  

Keffer et al will issue revised documents tonight.  There are no calls 
scheduled tomorrow or this weekend, giving everyone "quiet time" to review 
the contract.  Other than the accting issues, this should be about it. 

We deferred discussions about an extension until Monday.

Kay

Here's the electronic file.

I'm sure this doesn't  matter, but I'm in Jeff Hodge/Barbara Gray's cost 
center.  Just so long as I get paid!

4-13 was a vacation day.

Thanks again,

Sounds good to me.

I have received the draft documents and will look at today or Monday ( we're  
closed 
 day today). Can we talk early next week?

I think we'll still have the breakout contracts, which are essentially 
finished.  

Kay

Kay:

I'm sure there is a problem with converting AIP to Change Order, but Lee and
I can't think of any.  Will there still be the full Breakout agreement.
It's okay with us.

Also, we have no further issues with Bank documents

Kay - 

I just spoke with Marvin, he seems pretty happy--just a few comments so far:

? the arbitration/dispute resolution clause needs to reflect what is in the 
LOI
? weekends are not included in the definition of off-peak hours

Marvin, David and Robert are still reviewing and look to have additional 
comments by early next week.

fyi, Steve should work with Ms. Clark to determine amount of payoff is 
required for TurboPark.  Obviously, this is impacted by the date of payoff.

We have discussed with GE et all the prospect of a changed order to the 
existing master contract for the new ones.  So far, no one can find a problem 
with that approach.

Kay

FYI.  I haven't read it yet.

IT IS RAINING!!!  I hope it is raining at the house.  It looks like it 
probably is raining all over town.  Hope you get some there.

Neil's address is nmann@erac.com.  Paige's address is

how).

We had a great time this weekend, too.  I'm glad it worked out so well.  I 
thought it was very relaxing.  I would love to have the recipe for the beef.

I will probably go to North Carolina Wednesday, returning Thursday or Friday.

Take care!

Love,

Hi Bruce,

There's a Christie Patrick who is a VP of Government Affairs.  I'm wondering 
if this isn't the same person you referenced.  I don't know her.

We have our staff meetings the 1st and 3rd Wednesday at 130.  I missed the

Kay

Thanks.  I've been trying to puzzle my way through this.  

Kay

I don't think she's in.  You might want to leave her a voice mail.

Sheila, in connection with the Delta turbine sale, we have one pending issue 
with respect to the jursidiction clause that would have us consent to either 
NY state or federal court (you had revised the document to only have NY 
federal courts apply, but the Lenders have responded that they need the state 
court reference in the event that the federal courts will not take the 
case).  Attached is the redline to show how the clause has been revised to 
eliminate the waiver of forum non-conveniens and how the jurisidiction will 
only apply to the consent agreement, but I'd like your approval to accept NY 
state court as well.  In the alternative, Lender's counsel has commented that 
in another Enron transaction they were involved with, they accepted Delaware 
state and federal courts.  Also, please note that the opinion letter is no 
longer required.  Thanks in advance:

Carlos:

The only two changes we requested to the ENA Consent that Isabel Parker did
not make were as follows:

1.  Section 2.1(f) - no deletion of "best" from knowledge; and
2.  Section 5.8 - no deletion of NY "state court" jurisdiction.

I have not spoken to Isabel about these last items, so I don't know if they
were inadvertent or intentional, although my e-mail to her was fairly
specific about Enron accepting federal court jurisdiction in NY but not NY
state court.  Note that it is rather unusual to object to NY state court
when federal courts in NY are considered acceptable.  Please review and let
me know.  Thanks.

Please call, I have 4 four unrelated issues which I need to discuss:

1.   Whether in CA Power Development and Salmon, Enron will appoint any 
officers or directors after it has reduced its ownership interest to 20%?

2.  Who besides Christy Nicolay and Herman Manis should review Ameren 
interconnect agreements?

3.  Handling and payment of Piper Marbury past legal bills.

Hi there,

I am meeting with Ben tomorrow to discuss NWestern.  I'm fairly confident 
that he will be willing to extend the letter agreement, but he hasn't called 
me back today to confirm.

Ms. Kahn and I have exchanged voice mail.  Could one of you return her call 
for me?  I'm tied up.  You might get an idea on some times tomorrow for a 
call.  I'm booked until around 130 for anything which would last more than a 
few minutes.  I'll check with Ben.

Thank you,

Kay

Thanks.  I'll prepare Ben.

Kay

I've talked to Marguerite.  She agreed to a call tomorrow at 2 PM central.
She is sending to you and me a draft of an extension.  No need to do
anything with it tonight, but I suspect that Mike will begin calling Ben
about it in the morning.

I heard a rumor that there is a new leader for EEOS.  True?

Kay

Please change the FPA designations of the following entities to add the 
designation of ELEQ.

CA Energy Development I, L.L.C.
CA Energy Development II, L.L.C.
Salmon Energy LLC
Merchant Energy Ventures LLC

I noticed that CA Energy Development I and II have a list of Enron employees 
as officers.  I believe that when ENA sold part of its ownership in these 
entities that the co-owner may have appointed a new slate of officers. Could 
Matt please verify that the Corporate Secretary has been given current 
information for the data sheets.  I understand that one Enron employee is a 
director of each of these entities.  I believe that it will be important for 
FPA Interlocking Position Reporting for the Corporate Secretary to reflect in 
the Data Sheets the name of any Enron employee who holds an officer or 
director position.

Yes, this is issue is still around.

Thomas, I had some correspondence faxed to you today.  In it SW is clearly 
taking the position that the damage to the generator occured after delivery 
under the contract.  I thought you addressed that well in your memo, however, 
I have another question.  What impact does the use of DDP (Incoterms) have?  
Is it just one more part of the contract to be taken as a whole, or might it 
have some greater significance?  

Will the passage of ROL impact the LD claim?  I assume not, but I want a 
sanity check.

Thanks,

Kay

Attached is a legal memo regarding Westinghouse's delivery obligations with 
respect to the 501D5A gas turbine generator package.  I will forward you an 
additional copy by fax.

Gentlemen:

We have enclosed drafts of the following documents:

1.  Resolutions of sole member of Salmon Energy LLC authorizing the turbine
acquisition and related documents;
2.  Incumbency Certificate of ENA for the escrow agent; and
3.  Incumbency Certificate of PPL for the escrow agent.

The resolutions authorize the turbine contract, the loan from PPL, and the
G/E consent and agreement.  I have also drafted resolutions to be dated the
day following closing to elect as directors the persons named in the Amended
and Restated LLC Agreement (need the names of these persons - three
designees of PPL and one designee of ENA) and to replace the officers of the
LLC with persons designated by PPL.  If the lender desires Salmon
resolutions authorizing a security agreement to be signed by Salmon, we
would recommend that the new Salmon board controlled by PPL sign resolutions
ratifying and approving the security agreement, rather than have ENA approve
a security agreement that it has not negotiated and is not familiar with.

From a timing standpoint, we need to focus on the documentation required to
set up the escrow account, as I understand that the escrow may be funded on
the same day as the financial closing, namely, Thursday, April 19.  Citibank
will need (I) the escrow agreement, (ii) an incumbency certificate from each
party to the escrow agreement, (iii) a W-9 signed by each non-corporate
party to the escrow agreement, and (iv) a signed fee agreement.  The
incumbency certificates are enclosed.  Please insert names and other
information as appropriate.  We need comments to the Escrow Agreement in as
soon as possible in order that we can provide these documents to Citibank
for approval.

Thank you.

Yikes!  I just realized that tomorrow is Mason's birthday party.  I know 
Michael would love to go.  Both my husband and I work, but I will attempt to

Here it is.  I guess she didn't make my reservations. You might want to

Obviously, I do not need a car.

I would like to get these reservations asap for the upgrade.

Ben is ok with the extension.

Ben and I have a meeting with the accountants at 200 (just got scheduled - 
got to take the apptment when we can).  I'm happy for you guys to go forward 
with the call. Ben and I will join later if we finish in time.

Kay

I've talked to Marguerite.  She agreed to a call tomorrow at 2 PM central.
She is sending to you and me a draft of an extension.  No need to do
anything with it tonight, but I suspect that Mike will begin calling Ben
about it in the morning.

Hi there,

I am meeting with Ben tomorrow to discuss NWestern.  I'm fairly confident
that he will be willing to extend the letter agreement, but he hasn't
called me back today to confirm.

Ms. Kahn and I have exchanged voice mail.  Could one of you return her call
for me?  I'm tied up.  You might get an idea on some times tomorrow for a
call.  I'm booked until around 130 for anything which would last more than
a few minutes.  I'll check with Ben.

Thank you,

Kay

I say go ahead with the call to work through any nits etc.  We will need a 
follow up call anyway, once we know what to do to meet the accting 
objectives.  This means you won't be available at 200 to talk with the accts, 
but that's ok.  

Finalizing the extension sounds good to me.

Kay

Do you want me to postpone the call (I expect they are flexible)?.  Do you
want me to listen in on the meeting with the accountants?

Do you want me to communicate with Marguerite to get the extension in shape
for signing?

Gentlemen:

We have enclosed drafts of the following documents:

1.  Resolutions of sole member of Salmon Energy LLC authorizing the turbine
acquisition and related documents;
2.  Incumbency Certificate of ENA for the escrow agent; and
3.  Incumbency Certificate of PPL for the escrow agent.

The resolutions authorize the turbine contract, the loan from PPL, and the
G/E consent and agreement.  I have also drafted resolutions to be dated the
day following closing to elect as directors the persons named in the Amended
and Restated LLC Agreement (need the names of these persons - three

To clarify, the Edgecombe we were discussing is in North Carolina.  The New 
York deal is a separate deal.

Thanks,

Lisa:
One of Kay's developers wants to acquire a land purchase option in Edgecomb 
County, North Carolina ("Edgecomb").  While I recall setting up Edgecomb for 
you, I don't recall whether Edgecomb actually acquired land purchase 
options.    Is this acquisition a coincidence?  Are we resuscitating an 
asphyxiated deal?

I have some folks who want to option some land in New York.  Do we have a 
company for New York yet?  If not, I seem to recall that we were going to 
start using one of the existing companies for land options instead of 
creating a new one every time.  Am I remembering that correctly?  

Basically I'm looking for the company name to use in an option.  Any 
suggestions?

Thanks,

Kay

Carlos Sole will be working on it, so I'll let him answer the timing issue.

Kay

   
	
	

Kay,

As you and I discussed last week, Enron has met with the Seminole Indian 
Tribe ("SIT") and would like to put together an LOI to further proceed with 
discussions.  Although we might discuss several deal options, currently, we 
are focusing on two different projects (we might want two separate LOIs, let 
me know what you have done in the past).  The LOIs need to contain language 
that covers the following points:

One project consists of a 500MW, natural gas, combined-cycle facility located 
on land owned by SIT in Hollywood, FL
One project consists of a 4x500MW coal or natural gas, combined-cycle 
facility located on SIT's Brighton Reservation
Confidentiality language needs to be included (similar to what would be 
included in a Confidentiality Agreement)
Exclusivity and reciprocity language also needs to be included, as well as 
any non-circumvention language
Twelve month term (at least six months if twelve is obtainable; what was your 
experience with the Navahos?)

If I have left anything out or made any legal fauz pas, let me know as soon 
as you are able (I'm sure that Bruce and David will do the same).  We told 
SIT last week that we would get them something the first part of this week, 
so let me know if you see any delay.

My extension is 3-3526 and my cell is (713) 594-0439.

Thanks,
Mathew

Accounting and Finance tell me that wiring GE directly from escrow is ok.

Kay

Stephen Thome@ECT
04/17/2001 03:16 PM
1.  Investment of funds should be OK with Enron.  We are not receiving the 
pre-closing proceeds from escrow.

2.  Paul, can you confirm that wiring instructions in the agreement are 
suitable.

3.  What fees are reasonable?

Kay:

The escrow agreement that I have already prepared and circulated for this
transaction is the same form that we used in the Intergen transaction, which
is based on the form provided by Enron treasury for that transaction and
which is also Citibank's standard escrow form.

I need Enron to confirm several items in the escrow agreement:

 In Part I, Section 2, the escrow agent is directed (in the absence
of written instructions) to invest 50% of the funds in the Dreyfus Money
Market Fund titled Cash Management Investors Class (670) and 50% of the
funds in Treasury Cash Management Investor Class (673).  Please confirm that
these investment instructions are acceptable to Enron.

 Part I, Section 4 of the escrow agreement contains wiring
instructions for Enron.  Please confirm that these instructions indicate the
proper account for wire transfers by the escrow agent to Enron.

The fee schedule proposed by Citibank calls for payment by Enron of a $2,500
acceptance fee, an $8,000 flat annual administration fee, and legal fees of
Citibank at cost.  In the Intergen transaction, Citibank agreed to waive
legal fees associated with setup, although I have not approached Citibank
about a similar waiver for this transaction.  I need Enron to confirm that
these fees are acceptable.  If not, please advise whether I should approach
Citibank directly on a fee revision or whether Enron commercial people wish
to handle this.  Since ENA is responsible for all acceptance, setup and
administration fees associated with the escrow account (per the letter
agreement), I suppose it is acceptable for only ENA and Citibank to sign the
fee agreement.

Hi Carolyn,

What does Enron need to do to get the escrow account set up?  Is there
something Steve needs to do?

Thanks,

Kay

I don't know.  I hate to spring it on her.  Maybe suggest it for next week

Please respond to <nmann@erac.com>

What about the Charlotte idea?

I don't remember where this one is being held. If it's near StF I could

Or, what do you think about me asking Charlotte to switch days? NM

This is the rock gym party.  I bought presents for this and the Houstonian

Kay,

As you and I discussed last week, Enron has met with the Seminole Indian 
Tribe ("SIT") and would like to put together an LOI to further proceed with 
discussions.  Although we might discuss several deal options, currently, we 
are focusing on two different projects (we might want two separate LOIs, let 
me know what you have done in the past).  The LOIs need to contain language 
that covers the following points:

One project consists of a 500MW, natural gas, combined-cycle facility located 
on land owned by SIT in Hollywood, FL
One project consists of a 4x500MW coal or natural gas, combined-cycle 
facility located on SIT's Brighton Reservation
Confidentiality language needs to be included (similar to what would be 
included in a Confidentiality Agreement)
Exclusivity and reciprocity language also needs to be included, as well as 
any non-circumvention language
Twelve month term (at least six months if twelve is obtainable; what was your 
experience with the Navahos?)

If I have left anything out or made any legal fauz pas, let me know as soon 
as you are able (I'm sure that Bruce and David will do the same).  We told 
SIT last week that we would get them something the first part of this week, 
so let me know if you see any delay.

My extension is 3-3526 and my cell is (713) 594-0439.

Thanks,
Mathew

effectively remove the current Enron officers and directors.

Hi Chris,

We need to coordinate the setting up of an escrow account with Treasury.  We 
will use Citibank. I believe either Rebecca and/or Kathleen worked on this on 
the Intergen deal.  Can you help?

Also, do you have an address for the location of turbine 1?

Thanks,

1. Term.  What will we accept?

Liquidated damages language still ok?  LD=01,s should apply regardless of=

3. Our position is that Contract Capacity set at contract signing, then=20
adjusted (if necessary) based on performance tests, not subject to adjustme=
nt=20
after that time: ditto for the demand charge.  What is the right number for=
=20
the Capacity?  Is there a benefit to Enron to have a correction curve exhib=
it?

4. Failure to complete facility suggested as a termination event.  Is=20
September long enough?

5. We need to be able to supply from either or both sources (market and=20
facility) during a day, but this doesn=01,t give us right to change during =
the=20
day after the schedule is set.

6. Note the Start Up definition (as suggested by VEPCO) and how it is=20
applied.  Reject 50% requirement at this point, subject to their explanatio=

7. Note: construction of the facility now required (2.3).=20

8. Define commercial operation.

9. Confirm that Enron has sufficient protection from interconnection=20
failures/delays.

10. Day ahead scheduling (3.4)  Are we ready to commit?

 Payment Schedule.
Payment Date	Payment Amount
April 30, 2001	$50,234,000
	
	
TOTAL	$50,234,000

Such April 30th payment shall constitute full and final payment for the 
Units, except that Purchaser shall be responsible for the payment of any and 
all amounts associated with any Change Order after the Effective Date. The 
final payment is also subject to Section 6.1.3.  

Also, Delta has suggested that we add in language for the adjustment due to 
site conditions.  I added language to Exhibit A-1.

Both of these edits are from the CA form.

Kay

When writing the LOI, please don't limit it to a certain block size for the 
plant.

Good timing.

You mentioned that there were a couple of things you thought should be added 
to the "employee/consultant" form.  Could you email me the topics so that I 
can take a look and make changes.  Once again I expect to be on an endless 
conference call, but I can work while I talk.

Hi Kay -

You may recall that back in February, we almost finalized two
confidentiality agreements related to enovate L.L.C. activities.  Our
auditors will be sending to enovate shortly a letter indicating they would
like to review various books and records of enovate and ENA as its
activities relate to enovate.  In connection with the review, we need to
finalize those confidentiality agreements.

I have made the change you requested in the attached e-mail to both of the
agreements (PEC and enovate) and have attached below an execution copy of
the agreements for ENA to date and send to PEC and enovate for siganture.
Assuming the attached copies are acceptable, please have ENA sign two
originals of each agreement and send them to me.  I'll arrange for Bill
Morrow to sign the PEC agreement and work with Greg Penmen to have enovate
sign the other agreement.

If you have any questions, please call.  Thanks for your assistance.

I'll look at Michael's CA and Sr. Sole' will take care of the native 
Americans.

   
	
	

RE:  Michael Brown's CA - entity name
 Company: 1st Rochdale Cooperative NYC
   465 Grand Street
   2nd Floor
   New York, NY 10002

 Contact: Gregory L. Wortham
   Vice President & Cheif Operating Officer

I will prepare a first draft of this requested CA for Matt Gimble 
(bialateral) in connection with discussions with Seminole Electric 
Cooperative, Inc. out of Tampa, Florida.

Additionally, Michael Brown has requested a bilateral CA with an entity (name 
unknown at this time) that is a load aggrigator and site developer.  Enron 
will be giving proposals, ideas and "propriatary intelectual capital" and the 
term will be for 1 year.  The catch is, Michael wants language in the CA that 
the "Unknown at this time party" can not shop our proposals.  I will work on 
a first draft of this one too.

Kathleen

Kate,

Regarding the Confidentiality Agreement that we need for Seminole Electric, 
the following are the items that we would like to include:

One year term
Construction of a 500 - 1,200MW coal facility expansion to Seminole's 
Palatka, FL power plant
Construction of a 500 - 1,200MW coal facility at Seminole's Taylor Co., FL 
site
plus whatever confidentiality lingo that is normally added

Let me know what I left out (David? Bruce?)

Thanks,
Mathew

Sounds good.

We may not need the entity in New York yet, as we are looking at getting a 
free option, not anonymous.  Deals kind of funky.

Correct on the Edgecombe (North Carolina) thing.

Kay

So you need a new entity for New York and verification that Edgecomb does not 
hold land purchase options in North Carolina.  Am I on the right track?

Hi Carolyn,

Have we seen the security agreement yet?

The enclosed ENA Consent looks fine to me, but you may wish to run this by
Sheila Tweed, as she had a specific request on the NY court jurisdiction
language.  We initially advised Isabel Parker that Enron would accept NY
federal court jurisdiction but not jurisdiction of NY state courts.  She did
not take our comment, and Enron subsequently said it would accept
jurisdiction of commercial courts in Manhattan, but not state courts
generally (language suggested by Sheila Tweed through Carlos Sole).   Isabel
has drafted the revised version to delete reference to NY state courts
altogether and to limit the federal courts reference to those located in the
borough of Manhattan.  Please review and advise.

We are good to go  on the ENA consent.

Kay:

The enclosed ENA Consent looks fine to me, but you may wish to run this by
Sheila Tweed, as she had a specific request on the NY court jurisdiction
language.  We initially advised Isabel Parker that Enron would accept NY
federal court jurisdiction but not jurisdiction of NY state courts.  She did
not take our comment, and Enron subsequently said it would accept
jurisdiction of commercial courts in Manhattan, but not state courts
generally (language suggested by Sheila Tweed through Carlos Sole).   Isabel

We are pleased to announce the creation of a new group - Asset Marketing - 
within Enron Americas. The Asset Marketing group will have responsibility for 
the asset divestment function within Enron Americas and work with Generation 
Investments on selected portfolio acquisitions as well as managing power 
origination funding requirements with Treasury.   

Don Miller will head the Asset Marketing group and will report directly to 
the Office of the Chair, Enron Americas. Joining Don's group will be Stuart 
Zisman.  Stuart was formerly in ENA Legal, having most recently worked on the 
sale of ENA's peaker plants with Don.

Please join us in congratulating Don and Stuart in their new roles.

Kay:

I spoke with Isabel Parker on the following issues:

1.  I requested copies of the note, security agreement and the
non-disturbance lien document.  She said they will be using a securities
account with a securities intermediary structure (UCC Article 8 concept)
rather than a non-disturbance lien.  She said they are working on these
documents and will furnish as soon as possible.

2.  I advised that the ENA consent is satisfactory.

3.  I advised of the timing issue on the GE consent, such that the GE
acknowledgement of payment needed to be prospective due to logistical
issues.  She is considering this.

4.  She requested a quick response on whether the GE letter agreement is
consistent with Enron's discussions with GE, as she needs to get this to GE
as soon as possible in order that they will be ready to sign it on Friday
4/20.  The GE letter agreement (agreeing to the form of all of the
documents) must be signed this Friday 4/20 before the lenders will advance
funds, as this letter agreement is a condition precedent to funding.  Please
advise on this issue.

I also spoke with Greg Lang and expect comments on the Escrow Agreement
within a half hour or so.  I reminded him of the need for a W-9 and an
incumbency certificate to open the escrow account.  (Estelle Lawrence has
also called looking for the escrow agreement).

Hi Ed,

Here's a certificate of incumbancy we need to Jake's Delta deal.  Can you 
handle signature?  We can work with a fax today, but will need a fully 
executed original for the bank.

Jake, we put a couple of Houston guys just in case something comes up.  We 
have assumed that you will be executing the docs.  If there's any problem 
with the list, please let me know.

We need this document to set up the escrow account today.

Thanks,

Kay

We may want to go ahead and circulate the ENA Incumbency Certificate for the
escrow.  I was holding it until the Salmon Incumbency Certificate revisions
were completed by Paul Hastings so that the two documents could be
circulated simultaneously, but I'm not sure they will get that document to
us in time to do both together.  Thanks.

David Duran can sign the certificate.  Can he certify his own name?  If so, 
we want him to also be a signatory.  Authorized signers should be Dave Duran 
(managing director),  Michael J Miller (vice president) and Kevin Presto 
(vice president).

Kathleen, please verify the way these guys like to sign their names, and 
current titles.  Let me know if you think we should use someone else.

Chris, we need a name and a call back number for whoever will be watching for 
the wires.  They will be a call back person. Other call backs are me (using

|            TOTAL| $50,234,000     |
|-----------------+-----------------|

Such April 30th payment shall constitute full and final payment for the

Hi Rose,

I hate to be a pain, but we are trying to sign up Northwestern this week, and 
the last thing we have to do is the assignment and assumption agreement.  Any 
break in the log jam with McKay?

  ENA Promissory Note NY/333403 (3v2 Firm Style)
  NorSub Promissory Note NY/333404 (3v2 Firm Style)

3.  We believe the NorthWestern Guaranty and the Escrow Agreement are in
final form (in the forms last circulated).

4.  We await a revised draft of the Assignment and Assumption Agreement.

Nearly final docs.

The change they want in the LLC is the addition of a statement indicating 
that for tax purposes this is a  single member LLC, or something like that.

The promissory note is felt to be necessary due to the adjustment mechanism 
for any change orders.  Has something to do with them getting all the basis.

Ann Elizabeth White@ECT
04/18/2001 06:56 PM
After our meeting, Ben asked me to please delete the phrase "or its 
designee"  from this draft and, with the assignment language (Section 14), I 
thought it was clear that there could be a designee (or assignee) if PBEC 
desired in its sole and absolute discretion.

I've also spoken to Herman about his concern that I didn't put in an 
additional Whereas statement that specifically stated that this agreement is 
not a binding obligation on PBEC's part to build the facility or incur any of 
the fees addressed. Ben and I also discussed this and I had hoped that adding 
a Whereas Clause that says "PBEC desires to construct the Facility if it 
receives all requisite local, city, county, state or federal approvals for 
development and construction thereof" made it clearly contingent and that, 
coupled with broad assignment and termination language, would suffice.  As 
Barbara specifically pointed out at our meeting, the agreement is in fact a 
binding agreement but the obligations under the agreement are not binding 
until the conditions subsequent have occurred (being the commencement of 
construction) and the events of commencement of construction are entirely 
within PBEC's control.

I guess I'm not clear as to what the  concern is for adding the word 
"designee" when the agreement says PBEC has the sole and absolute right to 
assign to another party, without the City's consent and, if we elect to not 
build the facility or the agreement otherwise terminates, PBEC is relieved of 
all obligations under the agreement, which is what is provided for in Section 
16.d.  I would think that the broad rights of assignment and the absolute 
release are stronger than just adding the word "designee" in the definition 
of PBEC.

Ann Elizabeth - I have reviewed the latest draft - is there any reason why we 
can't add the phrase "or its designee" in the definition of "PBEC"?  Although 
I understand you have included a broad assignment provision, it helps to 
include "designee" language to show our compliance with the facility 
structure. 

Thanks,

Rose

"designee" when the agreement says PBEC has the sole and absolute right to 
assign to another party, without the City's consent and, if we elect to not 
build the facility or the agreement otherwise terminates, PBEC is relieved of 
all obligations under the agreement, which is what is provided for in Section 
16.d.  I would think that the broad rights of assignment and the absolute 
release are stronger than just adding the word "designee" in the definition 
of PBEC.

Ann Elizabeth - I have reviewed the latest draft - is there any reason why we 
can't add the phrase "or its designee" in the definition of "PBEC"?  Although 
I understand you have included a broad assignment provision, it helps to 
include "designee" language to show our compliance with the facility 
structure. 

Thanks,

Rose

You asked for the exhibits.

Ever get the POR info?

Hi guys, 

Here's a list of questions as I'm working through MDEA.  Actually, some are 
questions, some are reminders of things you were going to send me:

Receipt Point - need def'n  RR
Load info - I was going to plug in something, or we were going to have an 
exhibit to describe.  RR
Off peak defn - RR 
transmission - we've added transmission services, but it isn't defnd.  Any 
suggestions?
scheduling equipment - do we want to refer to the list?
term - previously I was instructed to take out the evergreen renewal, now is 
it back in?  If so, is the mechanism in the first draft ok?
contracted resources - I've added in a def'n - we need a schedule. Name, 
date, subject matter of contract.

More questions to come, but I wanted to get this to you asap.  Reagan, you 
might want to look through the comments you gave me for more open items.

Thanks!

Kay

I disagree. NONE of the problems I've had in the last 2 weeks can be 
attributed to changes.  There was no explanation given as to why they booked 
me to return a day early on the first trip to DC. What was up with that? Last 
week, I wrote down EXACTLY the flights I wanted didn't change my plans.  In 
fact, I've spent more time investigating my options by myself than I ever had 
before.  

A travel agent ought to be able to deal with changes anyway.  That is what 
business travel is all about, and has been for the 16 years I've been flying 
around North America, South America and Europe.  I've had good agents and bad 
ones.  The good ones can deal with the changes and never miss a beat.

Please have my flight changed as follows:

Wednesday, August 2nd, change to Continental flight no. 1882, departing IAH 
at 122pm and arriving RDU at 510pm.

The remainder of the travel plans stay the same.

Thanks,

Kay

All this changing is where the problems come in!!!!!!!  Why can't they just 
make up their mind about what time they want to leave.  You are already 
upgraded and ticketed.  Let me know ASAP if you want to change so they won't 
charge your card, etc.

Thank you Kay.  I do have the earlier versions and I will pass the document
on to the lenders.
Another condition precedent to funding tomorrow is getting a response from
GE as to whether they have any further comments on the documents circulated
to them yesterday, and whether someone from GE will be available tomorrow to
sign the letter circulated yesterday attaching the agreed forms of consent,
opinion and Turbine Contract.
I would be grateful if you speak to Kent Shoemaker and ask him to let us
know today whether he has any comments and whether a signatory will be
available on Firday morning to sign the letter.
Thank you
Isabel

Isabel,

I'm waiting on Delta to give me language concerning a performance guarantee
adjustment for site conditions before turning the execution version.

The GE parent guaranty and LOC are in the all the earlier versions I sent,
and remain unchanged.  Please let me know if you don't have the earlier
versions.

Do you know when we might receive a revised Turbine Contract?  The lenders
would like to review the GE parent guarantee.
Thank you
Isabel

The following language/numbers are acceptable to GE:

6.1.2     Payment Schedule.
|-----------------+-----------------|
|   Payment Date  |  Payment Amount |
|-----------------+-----------------|
| April 30, 2001  |$50,234,000      |

|-----------------+-----------------|
|                 |                 |
|-----------------+-----------------|
|            TOTAL| $50,234,000     |
|-----------------+-----------------|

Such April 30th payment shall constitute full and final payment for the
Units, except that Purchaser shall be responsible for the payment of any
and all amounts associated with any Change Order after the Effective Date.
The final payment is also subject to Section 6.1.3.

The form of the letter of credit is included as an exhibit to the turbine
contract (exhibit D) and the form of GE parent guarantee is attached as
Exhibit C-1.

Where do you want this to go?

Someone (I think Dave) asked that this be added:

Each day EPMI shall provide EPMI's Native Load projection, and gas and power 
projection.

Would it be a projection of  MDEA's Native Load?  Are we providing it or is 
MDEA?  By what time is the  made  and is it made 365 days a year?

We need this document to set up the escrow account today.

You made a comment on page 13.  It says "(c) purchase of  power ...."

I think this is one of your comments.  What does it mean?

I'm on a conference call, so an email response would be appreciated.

yes.  

Actually, there is a comment...

10.  Delivery point, Receipt Point, and Title
"(a)  In any sale or purchase of Products under a Transaction contemplated 
under this...."

The existing language was only sale oriented.  Does this make sense??

Greg asked for an ENA letter similar to the GE letter to be signed at escrow
funding agreeing to the execution of these forms at closing.  I will
duplicate the GE letter.  I'm still waiting on his and Isabel's response to

Please find attached the following:
(a) a clean and blacklined copy of the GE Consent, showing the changes from
the version last circulated to you;
(b) a clean and blacklined copy of the GE legal opinion to be issued by
Daniel Rowley, reflecting the changes requested by you; and
(c) a form of letter to be signed by GE, attaching the agreed forms of the
Turbine Contract, GE Consent and GE legal opinion.

The lenders are to fund on Friday.  As they are funding into escrow without
an executed Turbine Contract or Consent from GE, the GE letter attaching the
agreed documents is a condition precedent to funding.  We would be grateful
for any comments on the letter, and if you could confirm that a signatory
will be available on Friday to sign the letter by fax.

The lenders will fund into an escrow account and the funds in that escrow
account will be released to GE when all the relevant documentation is
signed.  For that reason, we will draft and send to you for your review a
simple form of receipt to be signed by GE, acknowledging  that it has
received payment in full from the escrow account.  This receipt will be
signed when the Turbine Contract and Consent are signed, but not released
until GE has actually received its money.

I appreciate that the timing of this structure is complicated.  Please do
give me a call with any comments on the documents or with any queries
regarding timing.  My telephone number is 212 277 4025.

We are pleased to announce the creation of a new group - Asset Marketing - 
within Enron Americas. The Asset Marketing group will have responsibility for 
the asset divestment function within Enron Americas and work with Generation 
Investments on selected portfolio acquisitions as well as managing power 
origination funding requirements with Treasury.   

Don Miller will head the Asset Marketing group and will report directly to

Zisman.  Stuart was formerly in ENA Legal, having most recently worked on the 
sale of ENA's peaker plants with Don.

Please join us in congratulating Don and Stuart in their new roles.

Gentlemen,

Here are some points which require commercial et al input:

Do we intend to include gas transactions in our calculation of profit?

We will be buying electricity to serve their load.  How should be be paid for 
those costs?  How often?

Jim Homco questioned whether we should buy the fuel oil.  What do you want to 
do?

I've added the definition of Scheduling Equipment Costs.  How should it be 
used in the agreement?  Are we limiting our provision of scheduling equipment 
to the equipment  listed in the exhibit?

What financial security will be required of them?

Are we attaching Marketing Strategy and Trading/Risk policy, or establishing 
a time line?

How do we deal with the possible cost of establishing a control area?  Are we 
absorbing it?  Will there be additional infrastructure costs?

Have the exhibits been updated?  If so, could I get the latest version?

Kay

Hi Steve,

We need wiring instructions for the account that will receive the $ from 
escrow.  It should be an  account where money goes in and out in one day.  
Can you track down the info?

We are waiting for the lenders to comment on the proposal that they will 
close once we deliver our deliverables.  Stay tuned!

She called me, too.

I am just now getting started with work. John met me at the door the first
thing and we talked for almost an hour and a half about a new game plan he
wanted to get my thoughts on. If it hadn't been for my training seminar at 9
I don't know how long we would have talked.

The school nurse called and asked that we keep a watch on Michael for pink
eye. He was taken to see the nurse because his left eye was red. He first
told Norris he rubbed it. Then he said he poked himself in the eye. The
nurse says she doesn't think he has it but there is a case of pink eye in
the class. She said when she asked the teacher if she should call me Michael
said absolutely! She said he was fine and there was no reason to pick him up
early.

Love, NM

I wasn't blaming you.  I was just disagreeing with the statement that that 
changes have caused the problem.

You don't have to investigate your options if you'll tell me what you need.  
I can't help it if we have a new travel agent.  I'll get the flight changed.

	Kay Mann@ENRON

I disagree. NONE of the problems I've had in the last 2 weeks can be 
attributed to changes.  There was no explanation given as to why they booked 
me to return a day early on the first trip to DC. What was up with that? Last 
week, I wrote down EXACTLY the flights I wanted didn't change my plans.  In 
fact, I've spent more time investigating my options by myself than I ever had 
before.  

A travel agent ought to be able to deal with changes anyway.  That is what 
business travel is all about, and has been for the 16 years I've been flying 
around North America, South America and Europe.  I've had good agents and bad 
ones.  The good ones can deal with the changes and never miss a beat.

Please have my flight changed as follows:

Wednesday, August 2nd, change to Continental flight no. 1882, departing IAH 
at 122pm and arriving RDU at 510pm.

The remainder of the travel plans stay the same.

Thanks,

Kay

All this changing is where the problems come in!!!!!!!  Why can't they just

I'm not betting the farm on the escrow funding tomorrow.  I'll manage=20
expectations on this end.  I don't want to let up on Delta, however.

Kay:

We need agreement on the escrow disbursement letter (which Delta still need=
s
to comment on).  Per the letter agreement, we already have agreement on the
form of Amended and Restated LLC Agreement; however, the outstanding issue
with respect to requiring unanimous member consent for sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of the LLC is still on the table. =20

Isabel Parker called and reminded me that the ENA Consent and Agreement is
to be signed tomorrow, Friday 4/20, contemporaneously with the funding of
the escrow account, rather than upon closing.  She is happy with the letter
if we drop its references to the ENA Consent and Agreement.

I am now worried about the ability to have an escrow funded by tomorrow,
given that we still haven't let the escrow agent in on this structure.  Gre=
g
called about an hour ago and said he was working on comments to the escrow
agreement.

I think she will have a great time.  The moms and dads are very friendly.  
She'll probably know some of them!

I tried...NM

   Absolutely not.  I will leave work at 3:00 and can be at the party
by 4:00.  Just let me know what the kid's name is so we will get in the
right party.  I'm just training a junior secretary and it's ABSOLUTELY NO
PROBLEM.  I enjoy the parties.

Charlotte,
I just realized the party starts at 4 pm at the Houstonian. I don't what you
to have to take off early from work for this. Let's just have you do the
normal pick up on Tuesday and I will handle the party on Wednesday. NM

   I have this on my book and will cover Tuesday and Wednesday (24 &
25).  Let me know how early I should pick him up at school as it is no
problem for me to get away early.

   In fact, I enjoy these kid birthday parties.

Kay:

Another thought:  It seems that perhaps we should require a letter from PPL
instructing ENA that the attached forms of Promissory Note, Security
Agreement and Financing Statement are the forms desired, negotiated and
approved by PPL for purposes of obtaining its financing, and acknowledging
that PPL indemnifies ENA from and against, and that ENA shall have no
liability or responsiblity, whether pursuant to the letter agreement or as
sole member or otherwise for, the substance or content of the Promissory
Note, Security Agreement and Financing Statement.  What do you think?

I believe it is the E-Next Generation LV Co Gen contract.  I believe the last

Dear Kay and Dale,
 Peter Thompson is on vacation and has asked me to make the
attached changes (sent to Peter by Dale).  They are very
straight-forward and will only take a minute.  However, there are a
couple of contracts to which the changes could potentially apply, and
I'd like to make sure I've got the right one before I start making
changes.  Please let me know which contract needs to be changed, and
I'll take care of the rest.  Thank you, Chris

Here's what we're hearing from our contractor.  Can you work them in,
Peter?
I'm not sure the status of these agreements and the ability or
appropriateness to incorporate changes. But, here's he input for
consideration.
Please consider the attached comments in your final
negotiations with GE and ABB. Hopefully this format
is more user friendly than the whole pile. These are
Lauren/DHEC understanding of requirements to conform
with EPC contract.  Bill Phillips

Bill,

In reviewing these documents we find that these changes were not
incorporated.  Could you please make certain they are included.

Thanks

Paul

She may turn out to be great, just because she becomes extra cautious with us.

Yea, maybe I was trying to make excuses for TAP.  You are right, I have 
changed things in the past and have had no problems.  Maybe this woman will 
turn out ok.  She seems to be listening to what I say to her.  She's taking 
nothing for granted any more.

I wasn't blaming you.  I was just disagreeing with the statement that that 
changes have caused the problem.

You don't have to investigate your options if you'll tell me what you need.  
I can't help it if we have a new travel agent.  I'll get the flight changed.

	Kay Mann@ENRON
	08/01/2000 10:18 AM
		
I disagree. NONE of the problems I've had in the last 2 weeks can be 
attributed to changes.  There was no explanation given as to why they booked 
me to return a day early on the first trip to DC. What was up with that? Last 
week, I wrote down EXACTLY the flights I wanted didn't change my plans.  In 
fact, I've spent more time investigating my options by myself than I ever had 
before.  

A travel agent ought to be able to deal with changes anyway.  That is what 
business travel is all about, and has been for the 16 years I've been flying 
around North America, South America and Europe.  I've had good agents and bad 
ones.  The good ones can deal with the changes and never miss a beat.

Please have my flight changed as follows:

Wednesday, August 2nd, change to Continental flight no. 1882, departing IAH 
at 122pm and arriving RDU at 510pm.

The remainder of the travel plans stay the same.

Thanks,

Kay

All this changing is where the problems come in!!!!!!!  Why can't they just 
make up their mind about what time they want to leave.  You are already 
upgraded and ticketed.  Let me know ASAP if you want to change so they won't 
charge your card, etc.

Attached is a revised draft of the LLC Agreement which has been marked to
indicate the changes from the draft distributed on Friday, April 13.  Since
the most substantive change made to the LLC Agreement reflects
NorthWestern's desire to have the LLC treated as a single member limited
liability company for tax purposes, it might be a good idea to get your tax
team to sign off on the revised draft.  Call me if you have any questions.

Gentlemen:

We have enclosed revised resolutions of Salmon Energy LLC, marked to reflect
revisions from the draft previously circulated on April 17, 2001.  Per my
prior e-mail, based on the new timing structure, ENA, as sole member, will
no longer be approving the loan from PPL, the security agreement in favor of
PPL, or the GE Consent and Agreement, all of which will now be approved and
executed by the newly elected Pegasus slate of directors and officers,
effective on the closing date.  We will leave preparation of the authorizing
resolutions for those items up to you.  Thanks.

Carolyn- I discussed the issue re the ENA letter with the lenders and they
can live with the delivery of a letter attaching the forms with the "no
objection" and "no act in furtherance of frustration" language we discussed
with Kay.  We also need to make sure a mechanism in place that ensures that
upon Pegasus' payment of the $800 on the morning of the transaction closing
(post-Turbine K execution and pre-escrow release), ENA will deliver the
membership interest in Salmon and any other deliverable required to allow
the Delta/Pegasus slate of officers to be installed to execute the Salmon
Note and the Salmon Security Agreement. I suppose this can be effected in
that escrow control letter that Freshfields is drafting that ENA and the
lenders will sign.

Do you want to redraft your letter or would you prefer us to mark it up. Let
me know.

Hi there,

Here's the assignment and assumption agreement with the GE consent included.  
Please let me know if you have any comments.

Thanks,

PS.  In discussing the mechanism to move the turbines, it seemed that it 
would work ok to assign the turbines out of the AIP.  I can't find a flaw

Hi Kay -

You may recall that back in February, we almost finalized two
confidentiality agreements related to enovate L.L.C. activities.  Our
auditors will be sending to enovate shortly a letter indicating they would
like to review various books and records of enovate and ENA as its
activities relate to enovate.  In connection with the review, we need to
finalize those confidentiality agreements.

I have made the change you requested in the attached e-mail to both of the
agreements (PEC and enovate) and have attached below an execution copy of
the agreements for ENA to date and send to PEC and enovate for siganture.
Assuming the attached copies are acceptable, please have ENA sign two
originals of each agreement and send them to me.  I'll arrange for Bill
Morrow to sign the PEC agreement and work with Greg Penmen to have enovate

Any luck with this?

I have some folks who want to option some land in New York.  Do we have a 
company for New York yet?  If not, I seem to recall that we were going to 
start using one of the existing companies for land options instead of 
creating a new one every time.  Am I remembering that correctly?  

Basically I'm looking for the company name to use in an option.  Any 
suggestions?

Thanks,

Kay

Can you help me with these?  I need to get them fixed up today.

Thanks,

Kay
I am not sure if any additional items are necessary.  However, the following 
jumped to mind, and I am guessing there may be others:
1-Required Disclosure - what if disclosure is required by a legal proceeding?
2-Remedies - what, if any, remedies do we have for disclosure

My other quick thoughts are:
1-I agree that solicitation does not belong
2-Enron should be changed to enovate and we also need to cover affiliates, 
i.e. - the rest of Enron and Peoples.

That is all I can think of at the moment.  Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks - Gregg

Good timing.

You mentioned that there were a couple of things you thought should be added 
to the "employee/consultant" form.  Could you email me the topics so that I 
can take a look and make changes.  Once again I expect to be on an endless 
conference call, but I can work while I talk.

Thanks,

Kay

Hi Kay -

You may recall that back in February, we almost finalized two
confidentiality agreements related to enovate L.L.C. activities.  Our
auditors will be sending to enovate shortly a letter indicating they would
like to review various books and records of enovate and ENA as its
activities relate to enovate.  In connection with the review, we need to
finalize those confidentiality agreements.

I have made the change you requested in the attached e-mail to both of the
agreements (PEC and enovate) and have attached below an execution copy of
the agreements for ENA to date and send to PEC and enovate for siganture.
Assuming the attached copies are acceptable, please have ENA sign two
originals of each agreement and send them to me.  I'll arrange for Bill
Morrow to sign the PEC agreement and work with Greg Penmen to have enovate
sign the other agreement.

If you have any questions, please call.  Thanks for your assistance.

Hi Rose,

NorthWestern has requested these minor changes. What do you think?  

Kay

Thanks for the offer (and the call) but I haven't been able to secure a 
sitter for Michael.  

My schedule should be getting better (famous last words), and I hope we can 
get together soon.  I would like to introduce you to Carlos Sole, if you 
haven't met him yet.

Thanks again,

Kay

I noticed this morning that the firm's Diamond Box seats for tonight's game 
against St. Louis had not been claimed and so claimed them.  I apologize for 
the late notice, but if you would be interested in going tonight, I would be 
happy to make them available to you and your spouse, date, etc.  I'm still 
trying to arrange my schedule to go, but wanted you to have the opportunity, 
even if I couldn't make it.  Please call me or my secretary, Becky, at your 
earliest convenience to let me know if you would like to use these tickets.

Chris, Ben and Kay:

Tomorrow's conference has been tentatively scheduled for 1430 hrs (CST),
but, subject to Ben's availability, Kay would like to have an internal call
at 1230 hrs (CST).  The dial in number and passcode are set forth below:  

877-232-0064
25581# 

Regards,

Marisa
Chris and Ben:

Since Kay is tied up on a 3:00 conference call, she asked me to summarize
the issues raised by Marguerite's latest mark-ups.  The issues are as
follows:

1. In Section 6(h) regarding the Change Order, Marguerite has added a rider
pursuant to which ENA would be required "to cause the Original Purchaser
and/or the Agent to use commercially reasonable efforts to afford NorSub (or
its agent or representative), upon request of NorSub, such opportunity or
opportunities to discuss with GE (or to consult with GE concerning) such
matters pertaining to the Turbines and/or the Original Turbine Contract as
NorSub desires to discuss with GE (or to consult with GE concerning) and
which GE is obligated under the Original Turbine Contract to discuss with
(or concerning which GE is obligated under the Original Turbine Contract to
consult with) the Purchaser and/or Agent thereunder; provided, however, that
each of ENA, the Original Purchaser and the Agent shall have the right to be
present at, and to participate in, each such discussion (or consultation."
According to Jerry DeBerry, Michael Young raised this concept with Ben, and
Ben accepted it in principle.  Please confirm if you are okay with this
rider going into the Letter Agreement.

2.  In Section 8(a), Marguerite has added a clause whereby ENA agrees to be
responsible for, and to pay GE when due, and to hold the LLC and NorSub
harmless from any damages or indemnification payments which become due and
payable to GE on and after the Closing Date as a result of any event
occurring, or any circumstance arising, prior to the Closing Date.  Since
this provision effectively shifts the Change Order risk onto ENA, Kay
suggests that we only accept the provision if a reciprocal provision is
included that allows ENA to terminate the agreement as a result of any event
or circumstance that increases the Purchase Amount.  Do you agree?

3.  Finally, with respect to the LLC Agreement, NorthWestern would like to
be able to exercise its call rights with relative freedom while forcing ENA
to wait until Takeover or 12/31/02 before being able to exercise its put
rights.  Neither Jerry nor Marguerite understands why ENA cares when
NorthWestern takes ENA out.

Jerry and Marguerite were working on scheduling a conference call for
sometime tomorrow, so I will send you an e-mail confirming the details as
soon as I hear back from them.

Best regards,

Marisa     

Michael,

We (Enron and outside counsel) have not received any documents either faxed
or via e-mail as of Tuesday morning.  Once we receive the documents, we
would like time to review the comments before we engage in a conference
call.  Please either resend the documents to Kay Mann, John Keffer and
myself.

Regards,

Chris

Chris, in case Kay is not in today, I provide this to you.  Please forward
to Ben at your earliest convenience.  Thanks.
We have forwarded to you via facsimile our comments to the Letter Agreement
and the LLC Agreement. The majority of our comments, as you will note, are
intended to clarify the understanding of the parties with respect to the
various matters set forth in such documents and are not intended to "change
the deal". Except that, upon the advise of our tax counsel, we have
adjusted the amounts of the promissory notes to be issued in connection
with the transaction in order to maximize the LLC's basis in the Turbines.
We believe this is consistent with your initial draft of the Letter
Agreement.

Also, please note that we have included additional language in Section 6 of
the Letter Agreement which provides NorthWestern with the opportunity to
consult with GE on matters relating to the Turbines. This reflects our
understanding of an agreement that had been reached among the parties.

With respect to the LLC Agreement, we would like to discuss with you the
following: (i) the timing of the exercise of the Call Right and (ii) the
intent of your proposed language in Section 7 relating to the rights of
each Member to act in its own best interests with respect to the Call and
Put Rights.  To that end, we propose scheduling a conference call on
Tuesday afternoon, April 11, 2001.  Please contact me as soon as possible
with a time that is convenient for your team.

We look forward to hearing from you.

Note: We will forward to you shortly, revised drafts of the documents for
which we have drafting responsibility.

Did you know Ozzie is going to EES?

I have my CA expert (Kathleen Carnahan) is working on it now.

Kay - where does this stand?  Enron accounting was notified on Wednesday that 
the audit would be taking place.  We need this in place prior to the start of 
the audit.

Also, what about the individual CA's.

I don't recall  the answer was to the question about whether we have a land 
company in New York?  And if so, its name?

Thanks,

Kay

OK.  We'll standby until you give us additional instructions.

opps.  I just opened this.

Kay, no comments from DF today, so far...I am reading now and feeling pretty 
good about it.  The services guys want to conf. with Marvin at 10.15 am.  Can 
we meet after that?

Attached is the current form of the assignment agreement.  I'm awaiting final 
approval from Finance, but I think we should get this in front of GE.  Ben, 
do you or Chris want to handle this, or shall I?

Hi Jim,

We haven't worked with a term sheet on the equipment sales I've worked on.

Hi Clark,

Could you fill out this chart for us with names and contact info for the 
Bracewell person (or people) you think would fit the bill the best?  We had a 
list previously, but I believe some of the folks on it have moved on.  

Thanks,

After I wrote this I recall Ed saying that we don't have a New York company 
yet.

I'm fairly comfortable that I don't know  whether there really is an 
Edgecombe Development Company, and if so, is it available to use on the 
Virginia Power transaction.

Sorry for the memory slip.

I don't recall  the answer was to the question about whether we have a land

I wanted to review where I think we are in this transaction.

1. Escrow account. We are still awaiting  closure on the issue of the 
lender's security interest in the escrow account.  A proposal was discussed 
with them to ensure that we could still close the transaction even if Delta 
had defaulted under their loan arrangement.  Indications were that this 
approach was generally acceptable, and Delta/Hancock are to send a letter 
agreement concerning this approach.  This has not yet been received.  This 
prevents the establishment of the escrow account.  We have sent the escrow 
agreement to the bank, but Delta has not completely signed off on the 
agreement.  

2. GE turbine contract.  Delta sent requested changes yesterday, and these 
were forwarded to GE.  I have not received a response from GE.

3.  Miscellaneous docs.  Enron has responded to all the documents requested 
by Hancock.  We are awaiting responses to our drafts. 

4.  GE consent.  Hancock requested some changes to the current draft, and a 
new letter agreement.  GE hasn't responded to the requests yet.  GE has dealt 
directly with Freshfields, so it is possible that there are discussions we 
aren't involved in.

I've left Lee a message concernig the GE items and the timing of signing.

Carolyn, please correct/add anything you think is important.

Gracias. 

Can you see the mountains today?

Hola Kay-I reviewed the revised letter agreement sent to us on Sunday and it
looks good to me.  The draft assumes that the change orders get signed,
though you will note there is still a covenant regarding the moving of the
turbine.

See you soon.  Ciao-John

Do you have enovate agreement handy?
Attached is a draft of an agreement between Enron Corp. and the Enron entity 
that is the managing member of enovate under which Enron Corp.'s treasury 
department would agree to provide certain funds management services on behalf 
of the managing member.  Gregg, as we discussed with the People's attorney, 
this agreement would establish the link between enovate's managing member and 
Enron Corp. with respect to these services, since the managing member has the 
authority to take these actions, but Enron Corp. would be the entity actually 
doing the work.  We should resist any attempt to make enovate or any other 
party a party to this Agreement, since we want only the Enron entity that is 
the managing member to have a cause of action against Enron Corp. for any 
breach of this agreement, etc.

Kay, I am out of the office, and I didn't bring the enovate LLC agreement 
with me.  Could you fill in the blanks for me in this document with the 
correct names, jurisdictions of organization, etc.?  

Gregg, if you could take a look at the description of services to make sure 
that it captures everything that the treasury group does for enovate, that 
would be great.

 

Travis McCullough

okey dokey.  Aren't  you on holiday?

I was kinda hoping you would fill in the blanks.

Looks like they have re-surfaced.

I trying to find out if we have confidentiality agreements with the following:

North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency

Thanks,

Congrats on the ride.  Are you standing up at your desk today?

Kay,  I made it through the MS150 alive and kicking. I even rode with Jeff 
for a few miles.

How are the comments flowing in?  I have not seen anything form anyone.  
Christi N. said she would be done this morning.  I'll be calling everyone 
else to find out how they are doing.

Nope.  Carlos Sole (one of our lawyers) took the forms I gave him and fit it 
to this deal.  I do think the banks' lawyers weighed in.

Kay

Did outside counsel write this?

Hi there,

Here's the assignment and assumption agreement with the GE consent
included.  Please let me know if you have any comments.

Thanks,

Kay

(See attached file: Final Delta Turbine Sale Turbopark Assignment &
Assumption Agmt with GE ack.DOC)

PS.  In discussing the mechanism to move the turbines, it seemed that it
would work ok to assign the turbines out of the AIP.  I can't find a flaw
with that approach.

Hi Warren,

Hope you had a nice weekend.  My weekend went too quickly.

Hello to all.

This e mail is just a request for completion status of the GE Breakout 
contract for the LVCII gas turbines.  We are contemplating a full notice to 
proceed with the EPC contractor May 1, 2001.  The breakout contract is an 
exhibit to the EPC contract, and we would like to have the executed version 
for our file.

No pressure - just a request for status and a heads up as to what is ongoing 
with the LVCII project.

Cheers

Bill W.

Michael Brown,

Do you have the standard offer service agreement?  It isn't in Stuart's file, 
and it is referenced as being entered into at the same time as the PPSA.  We 
need to see how these two agreements fit together.  

Has NIMO given the bidders access to the contracts listed in the schedules?  
We especially need to see the ones that they can assign to Enron (PSEG and 
NRG). 

Given the size of the transaction I think we should have Klauberg (or another 
New York lawyer) take a look at it. It is an interesting deal.

Kay 

Currently trying to corridinate this potential transaction relatively 
quickly, given the fact the bid is due on May 8th.  What is the next steps 
for you in this deal, & what can I expect in the next few days.

mb

Didn't I mark his up all ready?  

Hi Jerry,

It  would be helpful if the tax point person for NorthWestern could contact 
Rhett Jackson with Enron. Rhett's number is 713 853-4718. 

Thanks,

Kay

Maybe next time.  I understand that you are just back from holiday, so 
obviously this comes at a bad time.

See you in SA.

Kay

Gee, makes you wish there was a way to track documents without having to 
speak to someone. (do I sound like a broken record yet?)

I'm fairly confident we can use this company, as the project I am handling is 
Lisa's old project.  There's time to wait for her to answer, though.

Lisa Mellencamp set up Edgecomb Development Company to use on a transaction 
in North Carolina.  WE're waiting to hear back from Lisa to what she did with 
the entity.   If Lisa acquired an option under Edgecomb, we'll have to set up 
a development company for Virginia.  We do not have an entity for New York, 
so we'll need to set up a development company to acquire an option.

Thanks, 
Ed

I hope this is the last thing.  Here's the latest version of the contract 
sans these insertions.

I believe it is the E-Next Generation LV Co Gen contract.  I believe the last 
draft was around the beginning of April.  I can check for more specifics.

Dear Kay and Dale,
 Peter Thompson is on vacation and has asked me to make the
attached changes (sent to Peter by Dale).  They are very
straight-forward and will only take a minute.  However, there are a
couple of contracts to which the changes could potentially apply, and
I'd like to make sure I've got the right one before I start making
changes.  Please let me know which contract needs to be changed, and
I'll take care of the rest.  Thank you, Chris

Here's what we're hearing from our contractor.  Can you work them in,
Peter?
I'm not sure the status of these agreements and the ability or
appropriateness to incorporate changes. But, here's he input for
consideration.
Please consider the attached comments in your final
negotiations with GE and ABB. Hopefully this format
is more user friendly than the whole pile. These are
Lauren/DHEC understanding of requirements to conform
with EPC contract.  Bill Phillips

Bill,

In reviewing these documents we find that these changes were not
incorporated.  Could you please make certain they are included.

Thanks

Paul

In speaking with Lee Johnson this am, he mentioned that he is still missing 
final contracts for PSCO and CA Development.  I seem to recall that Sheila 
had asked someone to pull this together, and that I had given Kathleen the CA 
Development stuff.   I could be off track, but that's how I remember it.  
There's probably someone with a better memory.

Thoughts?

Attached please find the latest LV Cogen Turbine Agreement (first
document below) that incorporates the changes received from Dale on
April 17, as well as a blackline (second document below) showing changes
made to the version circulated on April 10. As I mentioned in my prior
e-mail, the April 17 comments referred to an earlier version that
referenced Turbines no longer in this deal. As a result, I only changed
the Guaranteed Delivery Date for Unit 24. To complete the agreement, we
will need to insert the date of execution and Exhibit H-2.

Seller and Purchaser agree to amend the Guaranteed Levels and the Specific 
Performance Levels for each such Unit to reflect changes in the Basis 
Conditions made to reflect the Site conditions for each such Unit.  The

agree that implementation of the provisions and agreements of this Article 
XII shall be at no additional cost or result in any other change or impact to 
or upon the Scope of Work, Purchase Amount or Guaranteed Unit Delivery Dates, 
or all of them.

Very impressive.  We don't have to read these, do we?

You are working too hard.

Hope you have a good book to read.  

That's questionable.  

Houston's VP flies up here on Wednesday for 2 days of staff meetings and I
fly to Houston Thursday for staff meetings.  Because Comair is shut down I
have to fly through Atlanta which takes like 2 days to get to Houston.  I
fly back Saturday morning.  So you see, not really that busy, just occupied.

You are working too hard.

I am not quite a wreck, and no promotion or raise.  

I'll be at the Lake Austin Spa weekend after next, so that keeps me going.

doc said today no ab work until July!  He said he didn't 
want me getting a hernia and then have to have more 
surgery.  I couldn't agree more!  I'll just walk.  I've 
lost 20 pounds since January.  It was all that junk from 
the gallbladder -- that's why I couldn't lose any 
weight.  I'm feeling pretty thin, but then I start my 
period on Wednesday!!!!!!!!!

Hi Carolyn,

Any progress with the escrow agreement and any other outstanding items?  
Kathleen Carnahan has the original certificate of incumbancy ready to go.

I would like to get organized for signing docs today, GE, Enron and Delta.  
Could you email me the execution forms of the docs which need to be signed by 
GE and Enron (except the turbine contract)?  Hard copies are fine, I just 
figure electronic will be easier.

I had conversations with GE re turbine contract, and I expect it will be 
finished up this am.

Thanks,

Kay

Hi Wilson,

I've decided that it would be helpful to have a brief written explanation of 
what limits of liability and waivers of consequential damages are permissable 
under Mississippi law when contracting with the Cities or an energy 
authority.  Could you provide me with something along that line?

Thank you,

Kay

Hi Ed,

This transaction should close within the next 5-7 days.  Will the original 
minute books be ready?

Thanks,

Kay

I sent this yesterday before 5 to find out what you were planning to do re 
Michael, the game, etc.

the plan for what? 

so what's the plan?

This week, if possible.  As always, the sooner, the better.

Will do. When would you like to have it?

I forgot about Grandma.  I bet you love the temperature today (BRRRR).

Hamburgers sound good to me.  

I think MAM does ok in the morning, he just needs his hours of sleep.  Paige 
was worse to get up.

I had to drag him out of bed this morning. He is not a morning person like
his mom. I think he is more like his sister in that regard. We made it on
time and he even finished breakfast.
Remember I will be taking grandma to the doctor today. If the weather holds
maybe I will grill burgers tonight and get Michael can get to bed early.
Love, Neil

I sent this yesterday before 5 to find out what you were planning to do re
Michael, the game, etc.

Please respond to <nmann@erac.com>

the plan for what?

so what's the plan?

you bet

I take it that you will see to this once we have finalized the notices
and signature blocks?

Peter, from what I can see, the GE E NExt B/O rev 4 doc appears to be
ok.

Please get it signed and the final distributed to us before April 30th.

Nope.

Christi Nicolay (a lawyer in the Reg Affairs) is the authority on 
interconnection as far as I'm concerned.

Carlos -

The documents attached to the ConEd message here are their draft Electric & 
Gas Cost Reimbursement Agreements.  They cover the costs of grid 
interconnection for any site we might develop in ConEd's territory.  
Apparently, Gary Keevil of East Coast Power has been handling discussions 
with ConEd to this point, but with East Coast Power out of the picture, I'm 
picking it up.

Kathleen has coached me on questions about these documents.  First, do we 
have a Confidentiality Agreement with ConEd that covers these power 
development project discussions?  She's going to ask Stephen Plauche of 
Origination about this, but I'm betting we don't have one.

Second, are these agreements "Turbo Park" compliant, and have we set up an 
LLC to deal with New York development projects yet?  I understand Herman 
Manus is the expert on this topic.

Finally, what are the legal sticking points in these documents?  ConEd has 
called an informational meeting for next Tuesday, May 1st, for these 
documents.  I'm planning to attend.  I'd like to know by then what we like 
and don't like about them, and how to approach possible changes.

I'll call you later this morning so we can discuss how to proceed.

ABB is struggling with a fundamental assignment issue.  Their concern appears 
to relate to assignment to a project company or contractor which might not 
have the financial ability to pay.  I believe they are looking for some type 
of security (LC, bond, guaranty).  I didn't sense that they have an issue 
with the identity of the assignee, just the ability to pay.

Comments?

Kay

I spoke with Kent Shoemaker, and he has a conflict at 930 Houston time 
today.  I suggested to him that Enron go forward with the call as an internal 
call, and we can conference him in after 1000 (when he's available), if we 
have anything noteworthy to report. 

If that is acceptable, I will go to Sheila's office at 930, and we can call 
Scott and Rose.

How does that sound?

DO NOT PUT THE CONTRACTOR COMMENTS IN THE B/O CONTRACTS.

I sent a copy to Lee Johnson when first received.  I asked Lee if the 
comments had any merit.  (Mostly pertaining to scope of supply comments.)  I 
have not heard back from Lee.

I would expect Lee to let me know if any of the comments would have needed to 
be incorporated.  

I double checked and ENext/Wilmington Trust will not be executing the

Questions re Northwestern from one of the Enron execs.

Kay
Christopher F Calger@ECT
04/24/2001 10:28 AM
Ben and Kay,

What is our performance obligation to E;Next?

Have we spoken to GE re consents?  Is GE going to be difficult because this 
is the Frame division, not the Lee J and the LM6000 team?

Does NW have any discretion / approval rights / negotiating rights w/ respect 
to the assignment to the LLC?

If NW flakes, can we keep the $8MM or do we have to resell and sue for any 
shortfall?

In what scenario(s) would we not get fully paid?

Assuming Sep 1, what is the income from this deal?

Regards,

Chris 

 

   

Sent by: Ben Jacoby
Dave / Chris:

I wanted to give you both a heads up that the Northwestern (NW) GE 7EA deal 
should close today or tomorrow, and advise you of a related earnings 
recognition issue. 

The deal that we are on the path of closing is consistent with the executed 
DASH and works as follows: at the signing of the letter agreement, NW pays 
ENA $3 million, with another $5 million paid on July 15 (the Turbine 
Deposits). The balance of $40 million is paid by NW at such time as the 
assignment of the turbine contract is made to the LLC, and ENA sells the LLC 
member interests to NW. The outside date for this to occur, via a notice 
provided by NW, is Sept. 1. The $8 million paid by NW, and the obligation to 
purchase the member interests is a firm commitment guaranteed by Northwestern 
Corp. The only condition to NW's obligation to purchase the member interests 
is that ENA effect the assignment of the turbine contract into the LLC. If 
ENA does not effect the assignment, then NW would also be entitled to a 
return of the $8 million in Turbine Deposits. 

This structure is the same we followed for the Intergen deal which closed in 
January, except the Intergen deal did not have an extended period between the 
date of execution of the letter agreement, and the turbine contract 
assignment. In the Intergen deal, ENA did not receive any payments prior to 
the assignment and sale of the member interests.

The earnings issue raised by accounting (Herman Manis) is that, 
notwithstanding NW's firm commitment to purchase, ENA has two (albeit very 
minor) performance obligations. First, ENA has to obtain an Acknowledgement 
and Consent from GE prior to or concurrent with exercising its purchase 
option with E Next and assigning the turbine contract to the LLC  (we have 
had to do this for every turbine transaction). Second, ENA has to perform 
under its agreement with E Next in that if there is an event of default prior 
to the time we effect the assignment, we theoretically could loose our 
purchase option right with E Next and be unable to perform under our 
agreement with NW. We have suggested to Herman that both of these items are 
perfunctory in nature, and that all income from this transaction should be 
recognized upon execution of the letter agreement, We have further stated 
that we could obtain a letter from GE solving the first issue, but there is 
no solution to the second issue. Herman advised us that to the extent we 
receive a letter from GE on the first issue, and can convince Arthur Anderson 
that the second item is perfunctory in nature, we could recognize all income 
upon execution of the letter agreement (prior to the actual assignment of the 
turbine contract to the LLC). He did not think we had a good case relative to 
the second issue, and is reluctant to approach Arthur Anderson.

Thus, based on the above, in a worst case we may not be able to recognize any 
income form this transaction until Q3. While we think we have a shot at 
getting accounting to change their position, we do not think that this 
outcome should change our position on the deal as the underlying 
profitability is significant. The deal is also consistent with the approved 
DASH. We therefore recommend that we proceed with the execution of the letter 
agreement, and then decide as to how we should proceed on the income 
recognition issue depending on your views regarding income being recognized 
in Q2 vs. Q3.

Please advise me if you are OK with us closing on the deal as scheduled, or 
if you have any other questions.

Regards,

Ben

Hi Kent,

These are some requested changes to the Salmon a/k/a Delta break out 
agreement.  I'm not comfortable that Lee has reviewed these, as the comments 
were previously forwarded in another email.  In any event, we are looking for 
GE's blessings on this addition.

contract, the assignment and assumption agreement and the GE parent guaranty.

Enhanced  Sprint combustion turbine generator units in the United States with 
comparable Site conditions.
12.2 Storage of Unit(s).  Seller and Purchaser recognize and agree that the 
period or periods during which any of the Units identified and listed by

or both.
12.3 Maximum Period of Seller Liability.  To the extent any Unit identified 
and listed by serial number in Exhibit P is placed in storage as contemplated 
in Section 12.2, the duration of such storage period shall be added, in the 
case of each such Unit, to the six (6)-year period identified in the last 
sentence of Section 27.1 for purposes of calculating the maximum duration of 
Seller's liability with respect to any such Unit and with respect to this 
Agreement.
12.4 No Effect on Cost, Schedule or Scope of Work.  Seller and Purchaser 
agree that implementation of the provisions and agreements of this Article 
XII shall be at no additional cost or result in any other change or impact to 
or upon the Scope of Work, Purchase Amount or Guaranteed Unit Delivery Dates, 
or all of them.

Ok, I give up.  What's an estoppel letter?
Fred Mitro@ECT
04/24/2001 11:11 AM
Given the challenges that Carlos and I are currently encountering while 
trying to obtain an estoppel letter from our Illinois landowner (Bob 
Konicek), I believe that it makes sense on all our future land option 
agreements to include language obligating the Seller to provide such letters 
at our request.  This language could be easily included in the cooperation 
section of the agreement and would likely go unnoticed or unchallenged by the 
Seller.  It would simplify the site monetization process and avoid the Seller 
being able to extract value from us in exchange for providing such a letter.

Fred

Sounds good to me, although we are likely to find different purchasers want 
other stuff as well.  Kinda like on the turbine stuff - each counterparty has 
wanted something different.

ckm

A letter whereby a party agrees that in the event of a change of control of 
its counterparty, it will not use such change of control event as a basis for 
challenging the enforceability of the agreement that it has with the 
counterparty.  At least in our context this is what Fred means by estoppel 
letter.  He has a very good point that we should incorporate this concept 
into our further assurances clause in our option agreements.

Once these changes are made (on Version 5) and the changes received from

 I just received a phone message from Rick Vicens @ Delta Power explaining 
that Hancock funds would not be able to be scheduled for release for 
Wednesday AM due to Enron's inability to deliver Escrow agreemens and Turbine 
Contracts, consents, etc.  in a timely manner.

 This deal has been sitting out their to long and there is a concern that 
Delta is buying time in order to survey the power markets in California.  
Delta issued an RFP earlier in the week for power sales from their Pegasus 
project and asking for responses by Thursday 4/26.

 Immediate closure is critical.  Please provide me with the complete list of 
Enron Deliverables that are outstanding and standing between Enron, Delta, 
Hancock and Funding.

Hi Jerry,

Do we have a final, execution version of the letter agreement?  

I understand that Enron's tax folks are ok with the suggested changes to the 
LLC agreement.

We are working with GE to get the change orders executed.

Thanks,

Kay

Me again.

Please see the second paragraph regarding the authority of the Cities and 
MDEA to enter into contracts.  Your opinion would be most appreciated.

Thanks,

Kay
Definition of Event of Default - References Section 17.  I believe this 
should be Section 14.  This same reference to 17 is also made in other areas 
of the contract, such as in Section 15 "Termination".  Also, please note that 
under Section 15, some of the Event of Default Sections numbers do not exist 
(ie. 11 and 12).  Please look into these sections in their entirety.  With 
respect to this section, I would like to change the cure period from 30 days 
to 3 days and of course in instances of bankruptcy, misrepresenation in the 
Reps & Warr, etc., there should not a cure period.  

With respect to credit.  In reading the contract it seems that the 
counterparty is going to be a consortium of entities (MDEA, Yazoo & 
Clarksdale).  Are each of the counterparties jointly and severally liable?  
Answers to the this relationship structure will be necessary prior to 
proposing credit terms for both the Master Gas and Master Power agmts.  If 
this is the structure, we should probably look into getting legal opinions 
regarding the cities' authority to enter into such obligations.  In addition, 
do the city's have authority to enter into agreements for greater than 1 yr.  
In my experience with other munis, they generally are, but only at the 
Enterprise Fund level (Public Utility).  Perhaps we should confirm this.  To 
the extent that MDEA (stand alone) is not 100% supported by the cities, we 
will need financial statements on MDEA.

Yes, the draft that was forwarded to you on and dated April 23, 2001 is the
draft to be executed.  Note however, that the date of the letter will be
changed to reflect the actual execution and delivery date.

Please let us know when the change orders have been executed.
Hi Jerry,

Do we have a final, execution version of the letter agreement?

I understand that Enron's tax folks are ok with the suggested changes to
the LLC agreement.

We are working with GE to get the change orders executed.

Thanks,

Kay

Hi Warren,

Please print all of these documents, and place in individual file folders 
with the name of the document.  I will need 6 copies of each of the signature 
pages for each of the documents.  If it is easier you can just make 6 copies 
of each document.

Thanks,

LLC.DOC>>  <<LLC Agmt Enron Turbines Delta Power.DOC>>  <<Consent of Salmon

Kay:

We have attached execution copies of the following documents for execution
by ENA and/or Salmon LLC:

1.  Escrow Agreement (we will change pages to delete brackets on ENA wire
instructions and to add Pegasus wire instructions as soon as we get info
from Pegasus);
2.  ENA Letter re Forms of Agreement;
3.  Entitlement Letter Agreement;
4.  ENA Consent and Agreement;
5.  Consent of Sole Member authorizing the turbine acquisition and the
issuance of membership interests;
6.  First Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement (we will
fill in the dates later); and
7.  Consent of Members of LLC electing new directors, and Consent of
Directors of LLC electing new officers (we will type in names once they are
provided by Pegasus).

You should have the following documents:

1.  Schedule of Fees for Escrow Agreement; and
2.  Certificate of Incumbency;
3.  Assignment and Assumption Agreement;
4.  Bill of Sale; and
5.  Notice of Intent to Purchase Specified Option Property.

The following agreements are not yet available for signature by ENA:

1.  Escrow Disbursement Instructions (Greg says he thinks the one we
originally submitted was okay, but he wants to review again - he had put it
on hold due to the securities entitlement account issue)
2.  LLC Membership Certificates (need membership certificate books)
3.  Secretary's Certificate of LLC (waiting on revised draft from Paul
Hastings - they have promised to re-send it shortly.  If I don't get this in
an hour or so, I'll have my secretary re-type it and will forward to you.
Unfortunately, this one is the other incumbency certificate which requires a
number of signatures).

I have convinced Greg Lang that since the GE Consent and Agreement refers to
the fact that Salmon LLC has granted a security interest in the Turbine
Contract to the lenders, the GE Consent and Agreement should be executed by
Salmon after Pegasus is in control of Salmon.   Therefore, I have not
enclosed the GE Consent and Agreement in this package.

Please send over a signed copy of the Confidentiality Agreement for our
records.  If you have any questions or comments, please advise.  Thanks.

Michael problems. He has ADD and some other lesser learning problems.  We are

Thanks.  It worked.  Carolyn let me know that y'all would like to fund by

Isabel,

Please confirm before 830 central this morning (when GE's rep will be in my 
office to sign docs) that these documents have final approval of GE's 
counsel, as I believe Kent is not available to review documents today. 
Obviously, I cannot present revised documents to a commercial representative 
of GE without knowing that his lawyer has signed off on the documents, except 
to the extent that the changes are obviously minor.

Hi Theresa,

I'm not sure if Steve Thome mentioned this to you, but Enron is opening an 
escrow account in connection with a transaction with Delta Power.  He 
suggested that I forward the wiring instructions for the payment of the 
escrow fee of $10,500.  Please let me know what other info you need to tee 
this up.

Might close on the letter agreement today.  You didn't miss much - mostly 
negotiations with GE re: change orders. Our tax guys are happy, and 
Accounting is hanging in there.  We have revised the payment schedule in the

minor.  I need to revise the assignment/assumption agreement, then we'll be

Attached are changes to the Northwestern 7EA Letter Agreement.  Per Ben 
Jacoby's request, I have updated the Remaining Purchase Amount Instalment 
(Schedule III) Amounts.  Catherine Clark in Global Finance has signed off on 
these numbers, as well.  Please call me at x57968 if you have any questions.

Redline of revised assignment and assumption agreement.

Kay

I am attaching a operating lease summary which I have revised to include some 
basic asset operation stuff.  I've left Lisa a voice mail with a brief 
explanation of what we are doing, and asking her if she would take a look at 
this from a financing "fatal flaw" standpoint, with Enron being the lessor.  

I've been summoned to Nowhere North Carolina (Rocky Mount) for the remainder 
of the day and tomorrow, and will be back on Friday am.

Anne, I hope this helps keep you moving.

Lisa, many, many thanks.

Please delete Michael Miller.  It would be helpful if I don't have to get the 
certificate today, as that entails signatures of folks in two locations.  
Isabel didn't have it on her list.  It is also helpful if the certificate is 
signed by Duran or Calger.

Kathleen, is Chris Calger an MD or VP?

Thanks,

Kay:

Attached are some things that Jake will need to sign.  These are items that
were mentioned as pending in my last distribution of documents for
execution.

1.  Resolutions of Salmon (page one is the two members electing the
designated directors, and page two is the new directors electing the new
officers).  I had previously furnished this to you, but the names of the
officers to be elected were blank).

2.  Resolutions of Salmon authorizing execution of the PPL promissory note
and related security agreement and the GE consent and agreement (these were
prepared by the Paul Hastings firm).

3.  Secretary's Certificate with Incumbency (this is required by
Freshfields).

The Secretary's Certificate with Incumbency may be required today.  The
resolutions are not needed for funding but will be needed prior to closing.
If you have any questions, please call.

Hi Catherine,

I don't remember who actually gives the notice, but in anticipation of the 
funding of the escrow tomorrow, here are the docs.

I understand there is also a two day notice.  I don't believe I've seen a 
form for that one yet.

Who should send this out tomorrow after we get the fed ref?

Thanks,

832 651 3478 is what I have

When sending out the assignment and assumption agreement, are we sending 
originals to all four people listed in the second paragraph?  Do you remember 
how many originals are required?

Thanks,

Kay

Kay,
The deal team needs to sign and send out the notices (for Fountain Valley 
they had V&E do all that).  The notice needs to be faxed to:
Elizabeth Burnett (phone 212-325-9943, fax 212-325-8304) - she is replacing 
Shazia Sarker who (we just found out) is leaving CSFB on Friday.  Shazia's 
name and number need to be changed throughout the documents.  V&E also faxed 
copies of the notices to: Karl Wiemer at Milbank (phone 212-530-5209, fax 
212-822-5209), Lisa, Rose and myself.

The Assignment and Assumption Agreement needs to be signed by the deal team 
for ENA, then sent to Karl Wiemer, Ann Roberts, Jose Mercado and Doneene 
Damon for execution by E-Next Generation LLC (see addresses below).  The Bill 
of Sale also needs to be sent to Karl, Ann, Jose, and Doneene for execution 
by E-Next.

The second notice is called the "Prepayment Notice" and includes the amount 
to be funded 2 days later.  I took the V&E form used for Fountain Valley and 
removed names and amounts, however I believe Rose had some additional 
comments, so let me talk to her before attaching a sample Prepayment Notice.  
I'll get back to you shortly.  Thanks.

Re:  my voice mail concerning masters.

ckm
Forgot to make a note on the below.  I think that we need to be consistent 
with terms in the EEI Master Power and Master Gas agmts.  I'm not sure if we 
have sent drafts (without credit terms) of these documents, but think that we 
should probably include Schedule M to the EEI since we are dealing with 
government entities.  I will be out of the office tomorrow, but can be 
reached by cell (713) 446-8711. 

Definition of Event of Default - References Section 17.  I believe this 
should be Section 14.  This same reference to 17 is also made in other areas 
of the contract, such as in Section 15 "Termination".  Also, please note that 
under Section 15, some of the Event of Default Sections numbers do not exist 
(ie. 11 and 12).  Please look into these sections in their entirety.  With 
respect to this section, I would like to change the cure period from 30 days 
to 3 days and of course in instances of bankruptcy, misrepresenation in the 
Reps & Warr, etc., there should not a cure period.  

With respect to credit.  In reading the contract it seems that the 
counterparty is going to be a consortium of entities (MDEA, Yazoo & 
Clarksdale).  Are each of the counterparties jointly and severally liable?  
Answers to the this relationship structure will be necessary prior to 
proposing credit terms for both the Master Gas and Master Power agmts.  If 
this is the structure, we should probably look into getting legal opinions 
regarding the cities' authority to enter into such obligations.  In addition, 
do the city's have authority to enter into agreements for greater than 1 yr.  
In my experience with other munis, they generally are, but only at the 
Enterprise Fund level (Public Utility).  Perhaps we should confirm this.  To 
the extent that MDEA (stand alone) is not 100% supported by the cities, we 
will need financial statements on MDEA.

Reagan - Please forward projected load schedule when completed.

The fun never ends.
Estelle and Barbara:

PPL's lenders have requested two items relating to the escrow prior to
funding:

1.  Fax copy of the Escrow Agreement signed by Citibank; and
2.  E-mail confirmation that the escrow account has been opened.

Can you please furnish these items as early as possible on Thursday morning.
The parties intend to fund the escrow before 10:00 central time.  The money
needs to make one stop before it gets to you, so the earlier it can get

This message is being sent by or on behalf of a lawyer.  It is intended 
exclusively for the individual or entity to which it is addressed.  This 
communication may contain information that is proprietary, privileged or 
confidential or otherwise legally exempt from disclosure.  If you are not the

message in error, please notify the sender immediately by e-mail and delete

Just tell me the end is in sight.

Attached is the latest revision, incorporating comments from the Enron team.  
There were some comments which were either discussion points or not readily 
decipherable, so those will need to be addressed in the next version.  
There's still some harmonization/nit stuff which we will pick up then also.  
Hopefully, David Hunt (MDEA's lawyer) and I will hammer out the more 
legalistic (yet important) stuff while he is in our office tomorrow.

Ed, maybe we can schedule a call with our local counsel to get some  more 
comfort on the authority issue.   In addition, we can ask for an 
authority/enforceability opinion from MDEA's counsel.  We'll beef up the reps 
as well.

Reagan/David, Ed's availability is best first thing tomorrow (Thurs) morning. 

See you soon,

Kay

hey, good questions.  I'll check.

ckm

There are some blanks and questions in this.  What answer is expected.  Who
has execution version?

Kent

Kent,

This forms supposedly integrated the requested changes you saw previously.
Would love to have this by Friday.  I'll forward the opinion letter in just
a sec.

Thanks,

Can you tell me to whom we send the originals?

Kay
Kay,
The deal team needs to sign and send out the notices (for Fountain Valley 
they had V&E do all that).  The notice needs to be faxed to:
Elizabeth Burnett (phone 212-325-9943, fax 212-325-8304) - she is replacing 
Shazia Sarker who (we just found out) is leaving CSFB on Friday.  Shazia's 
name and number need to be changed throughout the documents.  V&E also faxed 
copies of the notices to: Karl Wiemer at Milbank (phone 212-530-5209, fax 
212-822-5209), Lisa, Rose and myself.

The Assignment and Assumption Agreement needs to be signed by the deal team 
for ENA, then sent to Karl Wiemer, Ann Roberts, Jose Mercado and Doneene 
Damon for execution by E-Next Generation LLC (see addresses below).  The Bill 
of Sale also needs to be sent to Karl, Ann, Jose, and Doneene for execution 
by E-Next.

The second notice is called the "Prepayment Notice" and includes the amount 
to be funded 2 days later.  I took the V&E form used for Fountain Valley and 
removed names and amounts, however I believe Rose had some additional 
comments, so let me talk to her before attaching a sample Prepayment Notice.  
I'll get back to you shortly.  Thanks.

Hi Catherine,

I don't remember who actually gives the notice, but in anticipation of the 
funding of the escrow tomorrow, here are the docs.

 << File: Final Delta Turbine Sale Turbopark Notice of Purchase.doc >>  << 
File: Final Delta Turbine Sale Turbopark Assignment & Assumption Agmt with GE 
ack.DOC >>  << File: Final Delta Turbine Sale Turbopark Bill of Sale.DOC >> 

I understand there is also a two day notice.  I don't believe I've seen a 
form for that one yet.

Who should send this out tomorrow after we get the fed ref?

Thanks,

Kay

Hi Cheryl,

I'm looking for the executed version of the contract with Westinghouse for 
the 501D turbine, which I believe was originally headed to Panama.  ENA is 
looking to use it in a project or two, and I need to give a look.  An 
electronic version would be fine.

Thanks,

Kay

Hi Estelle,

Have you or Barbara sent the email etc out re establishment of the account?  
We are on a conference call now re funding.

Thanks for your help,

Kay

Hi Guys,

Delta has asked when the LOC can be issued for the final payment.  We have 
every expectation that payment will be made on May 2nd, and we will know for 
sure by later today.  Would it be possible to have the LOC by Tuesday?

Thanks,

Kay

Salmon Energy.

Does the LOC go in the name of Salmon Energy, LLC or Pegasus?  or who?

 Catherine - Kay Mann has sent notice to E'next of ENA's intent to purchase 
it's turbines on May 2, 2001.  We received confirmation from DELTA that 
Hancock has funded our escrow.  Please let me know of any concerns or 
questions.

Portland voice mail is down today and I am on Vacation - I can be contacted 
on my cell phone 503-702-9925

John,  

Just wanted you to be aware.  No action required - water under the bridge.

 I thought that I was very clear about the deadline of 10AM Eastern time.  
Tell Carolyn to wake up.  Carolyn has set an expectation that is totally 
unexceptable and unfortunately to late to change.  I do not think that anyone 
external to Enron takes this timeing issue seriously.  This delay has cost 
Enron $15,000.  Every day that goes by and this deal does not close costs 
Enron $15,000 - 

 PS - voice mail in portland is down today - it would appear that PGE 
contracts to fix this stuff during working hours - no wonder we can't sell 
this company.

The fun never ends.
Estelle and Barbara:

PPL's lenders have requested two items relating to the escrow prior to
funding:

1.  Fax copy of the Escrow Agreement signed by Citibank; and
2.  E-mail confirmation that the escrow account has been opened.

Can you please furnish these items as early as possible on Thursday morning.
The parties intend to fund the escrow before 10:00 central time.  The money
needs to make one stop before it gets to you, so the earlier it can get
started the better.  Please furnish these items to the following
individuals:

1.  Carolyn M. Campbell (fax 713-751-3280) (ccampbell@kslaw.com)
2.  Greg Lang (fax 203-674-7646) (gregorylang@paulhastings.com)

Bill, I don't have any information about the ABB contract.  At last word, Lee 
Johnson was reviewing the latest version of the GE contract that Pete 
Thompson had sent out.

Kay

   
	
	

Good morning Kay.  Its just me , Mr Nervous, wanting a status of the 
finalization of the GE and ABB B/O E - Next contract signoff.
I have a call in 1/2 hour with Jim Gilbert (LVCII Originator) on DASH 
documents, of which these two are needed.

Please let me know if the finals are done.  If not, when. If done, please 
provide the official e copy to me.

Thanks

Regards

Bill W.

YIPPEEE.

I'm about to fall face down in my computer.  I'm not as young as I used to be.

Kay

They have appox 100 spaces open for each session. I have all the necessary
paperwork. It looks great and it looks very new. The kids I saw all looked
happy...NM

FYI, Dale has the lead on this one.

Thanks,

Kay

I have not circulated a copy of the LV Cogen/ABB Agreement since January
8, 2001.  I have not seen a 3/27/01 version.  I had previously sent an
e-mail to Dale indicating that the contractor's  comments to the ABB
Agreement were not made to the Exhibit B-1 of the LV Cogen/ABB Agreement
that I have. What I currently have as Exhibit B-1 is what Dale had sent
to me on January 5, 2001 as incorporating Don Hammond's comments. The
current contractor comments contain many discrepancies (in addition to
those that are shown as a redline).  Please let me know if I should
only incorporate the contractor's redlined changes, or should I conform
Exhibit B-1 to mirror what is in the contractor's comments? Perhaps if I
could go through the contractor's comments with one of you, we could
resolve what should and should not be in Exhibit B-1 of the agreement. 

Exhibit A of the ABB breakout agreement does not need to be revised to
show
losses. Losses are specified in Exhibit B-1, Section 10.0. These are the
latest revised loss values as provided by ABB.

 I have a draft of that agreement dated 3/27/01. That draft contains the
revisions proposed by MCS. As I indicated to you earlier, I don't have
issue with those changes. My only other comment in looking through the
agreement one more time is that the final two pages in Exhibit B-1 (in
my
copy pages 44 and 45) are performance specification sheets from ABB for
an
earlier design. The ratings, loss values, and dimensions on these sheets
are not current. I suggest these pages be removed.

This also is an issue I need your help on.  Please review and respond to
Peter, copy Tom Constantine. (or copy me and I will forward to Tom.)
                                                      
                                                      
                                                      

     As I indicated in my January 8, 2001 e-mail containing the first
draft of the LV Cogen/ABB Transformer Agreement, to complete the
agreement we will need to amend Exhibit A to show the electrical losses
guarantee as well as the base load for the units.  In prior deals we had
one of the technical folks look at this.  In addition, please let me
know which of the contractor's  changes, if any, I should make to the
agreement. As I had mentioned in my earlier e-mail, it appears that the
contractor's comments were made on an Exhibit B-1 other than the Exhibit
B-1 attached to the LV Cogen Agreement as many of the numbers do not
match up.

Don't forget that Global Finance is supposed to review these.  They have the 
turbine contract.

This is none of my business, but the turbines are owned by ENext.  Hows does 
the LLC give the assignment?  Should the turbine contract be in the name of 
the LLC, because it isn't at this moment.  Maybe I messed up.

Kay
lee.johnson@ps.ge.com on 04/26/2001 04:09:13 PM
Kay/Bill,

Bill says he agrees and accepts our comments to the A&A.

One change required to the Rev 5 document.  In Exhibit B, Add item "27)One
additional Human Machine Interface (HMI) per Unit (desktop PC type)"

Include these changes and we can get this done tomorrow.

Thanks,

Lee
Here are my comments.

Kent

Kent,

Please review and note that this needs to be completed by week's end.
Closing date is 5/1 and I'm out rest of week 5/2-6.  We may need some of
Kay's help if we don't like what we see.  But let's try to work it out with
Dale Rasmussen first (Enron Portland office).

Lee

Hello Lee.  (I know your thinking - What now!)

As I'm sure you know, we are fast approaching a full notice to proceed on
the LVCII project.  One item that we have as part of our EPC contract with
Modern Continental South, is an Assignment and Assumption Agreement whereby
MCS will assume certain responsibilities for (owner), and abide by the
conditions set forth in that agreement.  We will ask GE to participate in
that Agreement.  I have attached that agreement to this e mail for your
review.  Current plans are for a full NTP (Notice To Proceed) to begin
construction on May 1, and we are working hard to be ready for that key
milestone to occur. Your review and concurrence on the draft document
attached below is appreciated.

Please review and contact me should you have any questions.

Sincerely

W. J.  (Bill) Williams Jr
Director, Technical Services
(See attached file: GE ASSIGNMENT 173951 CLEAN 0417.doc)

 - GE ASSIGNMENT 173951 CLEAN 04171.doc

Here's something to work with:

Virginia Power and ENA agree that Virginia Power will authorize and pay for 
the ________ so that the queue (que?) spot for necessary interconnection  
(RIGHT?) will be maintained. ENA agrees that should ENA (or its affiliate) 
fail to complete negotiations and excute a power purchase and sale agreement, 
it will reimburse Virginia Power up to half of the cost of the _______ 
[Heather, this is a study (ie, soft cost) right?], not to exceed a 
reimbursement of $15,000.

Thanks thanks thanks

Attached is a spread sheet that can be used to calculate our exposure for the 
month of MAY.

Notes:

I do not have Yazoo's load so I used 80% of Clarksdale as a proxy.

I created a energy model that used a 10.5 heat rate and $5.20 gas.

The SEPA energy was not included and no cost for startups.

Looks like worst case we would be exposed for roughly One Million for May.

I can refine the model more if required.

By the way, they have seen the turbine contract.

fyi  Carlos is working on it.
John Moore
04/26/2001 08:04 AM
Kay and Carlos,

We're going to put a very serious and accerated push to secure a site or 
sites in the very near future, but obviously we won't get there without a 
priority commitment of your time and involvement.  If there are any doubts 
regarding the level of committment that we need, I encourage you to visit 
with Mitch to reconfirm our priority and urgency.

In summary, we have two quality sites and one less optimized area where we 
are going to focus in the near term.  The two quality sites are both subject 
to a "bid" process (Texas municipal political subdivision) and the respective 
counterparty's board approval,  We have no reason to expect that we wouldn't 
be able to secure the sites but it's going to take manpower and about 6 to 8 
weeks - this time frame doesn't work for us.  Contemporaneously with working 
through the "bid" process for the two sites and in the near term, we're going 
to focus on a suitable site area, although not optimized, that will give us 
relatively quick site control and allow us to progress the coal initiative.  
Our goal is to secure site control for the less optimized site by next 
Friday, the 4th of May.

Here's a basic summary of our immediate site options and an action plan:

1.) Less Optimized Site: (not subject to "bid")
 Bruce and I will contact regional land agents today to get a summary of 
available sites.  We'll  travel up to the region Monday afternoon to scope 
the sites on Tuesday.  We'll present an Option to Purchase offer to the 
respective land owner and secure, at a minimum, a Letter of Intent by the 4th 
of May.  Transaction needs to be in the name of an SPV.

2.) Gibbons Creek
 This site and PRB fired facility is owned by Texas Municipal Power Agency 
(TMPA).  TMPA is comprised of Bryan, Garland, Denton, and Greenville.  Our 
intent is to secure a site for a 525 MW PRB fired facility, and enter into a 
Shared Services Agreement and O&M Agreement with TMPA.  There is interest on 
the part of TMPA and this transaction is in play, however it's going to take 
time.  Contemporaneously,  our immediate action is to gain some form site 
control on the land.  It has been represented to us that an option to 
purchase will be subject to the sealed bid process;  that takes too much 
time.  Our interest is to close the option to purchase or some form of site 
control within two weeks.  I'm going to contact Carl Shahady, TMPA's 
attorney, to see if there is any latitude in the regs requiring a sealed 
bid.  You're more than welcome to participate.  (TMPA wants to use a standard 
Texas Real Estate Commission (TREC) form, which I have a copy of.)  Perhaps 
we can put a month-to-month "option" on the site, which effectively takes the 
property off of the market, while we go through the sealed bid process.  
Legal questions:  (i) Any land transaction needs to be in the name of an SPV 
- which one should we use? (ii) Coal projects don't fit into Turbo Park,  
I've exchanged voice messages with BrianK to see what needs to be done here, 
any suggestions?

3.) BPUB
 BPUB's Board approved the development LOI this past Monday, so we're ready 
to go.  The optimal sites are at the port, and the port is subject to the bid 
process.  The intent is to use the same form of option to lease contract as 
we used for the TEX/MEX sites at the port.  Again, this site control is going 
to take 6 to 8 weeks.  Aaron Roffwarg of B&P drafted the land contracts and 
he helped negotiate between John Davidson, BPUB's outside counsel, and Dan 
Rentfro, Brownsville Navigation District's outside  counsel.  I'm going to 
contact Aaron this morning and get him spun up on the new contracts and have 
him call DanR to get him alligned with our objectives.  Your more than 
welcome to participate in my call with Aaron, too.  Scott and I are going to 
meet with BPUB and with the Port tomorrow to indentify the site and confirm 
our course of action

That's the plan.  I'll be calling each of you this morning so that we can all 
get on the same page.

Thanks,

JMoore

I made some comments/revisions.  I'm  not sure I understand the 
profit/savings, but I didn't take the time to contemplate it. 

thanx

Chris and Mike,

We are trying to do some sales tax planning, and need to know when the first 
LM 6000's will be ready to ship (or store, as the case may be).  I know there 
are projected dates in the purchase agreement, but those were more targets 
than commitment on the first few units.  Can you give the current status?

Thanks,

Kay

Great.  I'm gone.  I'll have my cell phone on later.

Ok, I'll mark you out then.

	Kay Mann@ENRON
	08/02/2000 11:17 AM
		
Let's just assume I'll be out Friday afternoon.

I'm sure he gets that from you.  He'll be fine, just get him the help that he 
needs.  Let me know about Friday when you decide.  

	Kay Mann@ENRON
	08/02/2000 11:13 AM
		
I suspect that there are several options.

He is such a sweet, cute, smart thing.  You will like him. He is very very 
charming.

He can be helped though right?  Block out Friday afternoon?

	Kay Mann@ENRON
	08/02/2000 10:58 AM
		
We've known, but is has gotten to be a bigger issue as he has gotten older.

Are you just finding out?  I know there are things that can be done to help 
that situation.  Do you want me to block you out for Friday afternoon as 
well.  You need to get this taken care of quickly for Michael's sake.  

	Kay Mann@ENRON
	08/02/2000 10:40 AM
		
Michael problems. He has ADD and some other lesser learning problems.  We are 
going to meet  with the specialist next week.

I'm going to try to take off Friday afternoon as well.  We are thinking of 
changing his school, and Neil and I need to go visit a new one.

HECTIC!

Are you ok?

	Kay Mann@ENRON
	08/01/2000 06:03 PM
		 
Please protect Thursday afternoon, August 10th for me.  I have some important 
personal stuff to take care of.

I thought I did help.  I'm lost.
Marcelo and John,

As we have discussed before, we need to document that the price we are using 
for the LM6000's for Electrobolt  is "fair market value".     There are 
several third party sales at Enron that may be applicable to help with this 
exercise.    Kay Mann has offered to help with this,  but  to compare 
Electrobolt's LM6000's to the other sales, we need the equipment list for the 
LM6000's---i.e. what attachments are included with these LM 6000's.    

Kay, what do you need to help with this.   Is it a full equipment list, or 
some other equipment summary.    Could you please describe.   I believe 
Marcelo or John Ayres are the most likely to be able to provide the 
information, but am not quite sure what to ask for.      Thanks.    

Mary 

fyi
FYI
Dave, since you and I discussed the Pompano Beach Project last week and the 
history of the "rejected $10,000 Contribution to a city literacy group" and 
the unfavourable Enron publicity which resulted, I thought you might be 
interested in  the memo from Eric below and a brief "heads-up" on the current 
state of affairs on this project.  The requirement that the Developer  
provide a Fire Truck and  certain of the other costs we discussed in our 
meeting have in the current draft been depicted as "fire protection services" 
and other "services in connection with the development of the project " to 
satisfy accounting concerns as well as to be less inflammatory . 
Nevertheless, as you can see from the forwarded memo, there is a "leak" to 
the press and I predict more negative publicity to come as the result of the 
requests of the city, theNot in My Backyard feelings of the community, the 
previous negative publicity, and the backlash of the controversy resulting 
from Bush's election and accompanying local perception of Bush and Enron 
being one and the same evil.

As you know Ben is in Florida today meeting with city officials and 
discussing  the new proposed development agreement. Ann Elizabeth can provide 
a copy of the latest draft proposal which has been blessed by accounting and 
the Turbo-park gurus. Nothing will be signed without a legal opinion of local 
counsel as to the legality of the proposed agreement when viewed in light of 
the previous discussions with the city, including the terms contained in the 
previous drafts  discussed between Steve Krimsky and city officials.

Sincerely

Barbara

I spoke to Tia O'Neill of the Pompano Pelican.  She received the same 
information (as the Sun Sentinel received) from some nameless person 
regarding the payment in lieu of taxes issue and some sort of statement that 
this was a roundabout way for Enron to bribe our way to victory.  I explained 
to her as I had the Sun Sentinel all of the issues surrounding this topic.  
However, she went further with questions regarding possible amounts of $1 
million (for property taxes) or even $2 million to cover "some sort of sales 
tax."

It is quite evident someone close to the discussions is feeding the media.  
Any thoughts?

I am unable to gather any more information from David Fleshler (Sun 
Sentinel).  Interestingly though, the Sun Sentinel has not run the article on 
this issue.  My guess is they have realized that there is no story here.

Kent,

Please review and note that this needs to be completed by week's end.
Closing date is 5/1 and I'm out rest of week 5/2-6.  We may need some of
Kay's help if we don't like what we see.  But let's try to work it out with
Dale Rasmussen first (Enron Portland office).

Lee

Hello Lee.  (I know your thinking - What now!)

As I'm sure you know, we are fast approaching a full notice to proceed on
the LVCII project.  One item that we have as part of our EPC contract with
Modern Continental South, is an Assignment and Assumption Agreement whereby
MCS will assume certain responsibilities for (owner), and abide by the
conditions set forth in that agreement.  We will ask GE to participate in
that Agreement.  I have attached that agreement to this e mail for your
review.  Current plans are for a full NTP (Notice To Proceed) to begin
construction on May 1, and we are working hard to be ready for that key
milestone to occur. Your review and concurrence on the draft document
attached below is appreciated.

Please review and contact me should you have any questions.

I may make the tour through the going aways, esp Oz.  I called the spa to 
make appts, but got voice mail.

Love,

Good afternoon. Hope you day is going well. One week from today, you will be
at the spa!! I know you are excited. I'm excited for you!
You are out this evening, right? I was going to suggest something for the
grill but we can do that tomorrow. Maybe fish?  I will leave here about 4:15
for our New Area Mgr Happy Hour at 4:30 and will pick up Michael before six.
Check to see if you have an Express Scripts Rx card. It's paper not plastic.
That's why Paige had problems yesterday. I know I gave her one but I can't
remember if I gave you one or not
I will try you on your cell phone on my way. Love, NM

we need to do with it.

do we need to mess with this or can i send it to Marvin??

Many thanks.  Pardon my ignorance, but is there a list of riders to select

Roger/Herman,

I've recently joined Ben Jacoby's Project Development team and have been 
asked to look into how we can remove the four LM 6000 turbines from the West 
LB structure for transfer to the Austin project.  As I realize that this 
transfer must be managed carefully in order to avoid placing these turbines 
and the remaining assets in the West LB structure on our balance sheet, I was 
wondering if you could offer some guidance regarding this issue.  
Specifically, if we could set up a meeting for Thursday or Friday of this 
week to discuss how this might be accomplished, I'd appreciate it.  

Thanks.

I think there's lots which will need to be fixed.  I can't fix it now, though.

Here's where I am on the ILA.  I think it should be distributed internally 
and to the Cities ASAP,  with an explanation that we are still pondering it.

Kay

PS.  I didn't redline because there were formatting challenges I couldn't 
figure out.

Kay

Kay,  I think they will have the following questions:

3.  Liquidated Damages - does this still allow "unit contingent" power 
deals?  That is all we will be buying from them.
5.  Events of Default and Remedies - Is this OK with Mississippi law??
6.  Billing and Payment Netting - I don't think the terms will work.  Their 
boards meets the second and fourth Tuesday of each month.  Payment cannot be 
authorized until the board approves.
10.  Miscellaneous - the arbitration language is the Houston venue....

I just got your email, so I will send it anyway.

Instinctively it seems that the agent for concept would be stronger.  I'll 
check into it for the  longer term deal.  Obviously, it is a Mississippi law 
issue, so I'll have to get an opinion.

Kay

The following are my comments:

  - I assume that Settlements is fine with invoicing no later than the 7 th 
of each mth.
  - Section M:  Should we go this route (covenant of financial support) or 
would we be accomplishing the same if we structure this as MDEA, agent for 
..., similar to that in the Interconnection Agmt.  We should probably look 
into it further for the longer term deal.  I don't know which has the 
stronger fall back to the municipalities.

 << File: MDEA ILA (Mann 4-27 draft).doc >> 

Kay

This shows changes as if they were revising the doc that we generated on 
Friday.

Here are the issues I see with their draft:

Does not allow for us to sell them power, only buy their power and sell to 
others. This means that we can't sell them power until we get the full 
contract in place.

Fuel transactions include fuel oil, and I thought we weren't managing fuel 
oil.

Incentive fee (in main contract) defined to only include the sale of gas.

Doesn't include the language we need for internal approvals.

Payment section doesn't address payment for sale of power to them from the 
market.

Hi Carolyn,

As far as I know, we are still on board for closing on Wednesday.  

Kay

Consistent with my discussions with Reagan, I have revised the body of the 
interim agreement.

Some of the exhibit references will need to be cleaned up once we know where 
we are headed.

Kay

I think we are supposed to do this tomorrow (Monday).

Kay
I removed Shazia Sarker's information and added Elizabeth Burnett, our new 
Administrative Agent at CSFB.

Here's what I sent to Rusty on Wednesday.  It seemed like an option didn't 
quite fit, since PACS doesn't have anything to option, strictly speaking.

Kay

Due to the nature of this deal, I've prepared an LOI with an exclusivity 
period.  Let me know what you think,

Kay

I have a closing scheduled for Wednesday, so I don't know when I'll be 
getting to San Antonio.  Better leave me off the list.

Thanks,

No.

Kay, have these issues been incorporated into the ILA?

Here's the latest, not-yet-final-but-getting-better agreement.

I may not have sent this to everyone who needs it, but I know Reagan will 
take care of it.  Speaking of Reagan, he is generating exhibits.

Kay

Need exhibit B added.  Redlines are against most recent version sent by 
Reagan.

I've asked GE for the LOC by Wednesday, but I haven't gotten a response.

I'll have difficulty getting executed docs by Tuesday, since sigs are coming 
from Portland.  I'll have to check to see what can be done.  

Kay

Kay:

Can you get executed documents back to me on Tuesday?  Greg has requested
that we send the original membership certificate representing the 80%
interest to the collateral agent Tuesday night by overnight delivery to hold
in escrow until closing, in order that the collateral agent is in possession
of the certificate (for purposes of legal opinions) upon closing on
Wednesday.  Greg is planning to fax signature pages of all of their closing
documents later today.  (I will be out of the office at a meeting with
another client most of the afternoon today).   

There is one last question with GE dealing with the letter of credit for the
retention amount, as this affects our disbursement instruction letter.  I
advised Greg that GE's normal practice was to send the retention L/C after
receipt of payment.  He is considering this, but may want to talk to GE
about the ability to present the L/C at closing.  Do you have any thoughts
on this?

have the original to me by Tuesday, I can forward it to Isabel by overnight

original certificate.  With respect to the remaining documents, fax copies

I wanted to drop you a quick note to see if you have had a chance to review 
the CA that Kathleen prepared for a potential partnership we are pursuing 
with Ameresco regarding the development/marketing of a power generation 
facility in New England.  Could you please review and sign off on the CA at 
your earliest convenience so that I can get it into Ameresco's hands for 
signature.  Thanks!

Hi Ed,

Here's the language they offered:

M. Each of the Cities has obligated itself to be responsible for and to pay=

to, or on behalf of, MDEA, if required, that proportion of the minimum=20
monthly fee which that City=01,s hourly demand was coincident with Entergy=

peak hour demand in the year 2000 bears to the sum of both Cities=01, hourl=

demand during such hour; provided however, that each City has further=20
obligated itself to be responsible for and to pay that portion of EMPI=01,s=
=20
monthly fee which the economic benefit to that City from transactions bears=
=20
to the total economic benefit to both Cities from such transactions during=
=20
the month.

It is a bit cumbersome, but I think I like it.  What do you think?

I'll forward the entire doc soon.

Kay

How transparent is that?
We have decided to postpone the All-Employee Meeting, which was scheduled at 
10 a.m. Wednesday, August 9, and concentrate our efforts on a successful kick 
off of our 2000 Houston United Way campaign.  This year's United Way gameshow 
event, "Who Wants to Help Millions?", will run, as previously announced, from 
11:15 a.m. to noon in the Hyatt Regency's Imperial Ballroom, followed by 
lunch in Antioch Park from noon to 1:30 p.m.  We encourage all employees in 
Houston to attend this fun event and cheer your business unit representatives 
on to victory and to helping others in the community.

We will communicate the new date of the All-Employee Meeting as soon as it 
has been determined. 

During the Term of this ILA, EPMI shall be entitled to be paid a fee for  f=
or=20
performance as follows:=20

i. EPMI shall be paid a fee equal to the sum of 1) the Incentive Fee which=
=20
shall not be less than $12,500 and 2) a fee of $1/MWhr above the delivered=
=20
price for purchases of Off-Peak Power (the fee of $1/MWh shall not be=20
included in the calculation of Savings), and  3) payment for the delivered=
=20
cost of market power purchased to serve MDEA=01,s and the Cities Native Loa=
d in=20
accordance with the transaction Confirmation.  Individual transactions will=
=20
be confirmed by written confirmation to be acknowledged and signed by EPMI=
=20
and jointly by MDEA, YCPSC and CPUC..
ii.  In the event that this ILA is terminated early, the minimum monthly=20
Incentive Fee amount shall be $12,500 divided by thirty (30) and multiplied=
=20
times the number of days in May in which this Agreement was in effect.=20
iii. The Incentive Fee shall consist of forty percent (40%) of the Total=20
Daily Savings.  Total Daily Savings is the product of (1) the Savings per M=
Wh=20
calculated for the day, times (2) the total MWh for the same day of market=
=20
power purchased to serve system load.=20
iv. Savings per MWh is calculated as the positive difference between (a) th=
e=20
MDEA Target Production Cost for units that would have run if market power=
=20
were not purchased to serve system load, and (b) the delivered cost of mark=
et=20
power purchased to serve system load.

This is really just an excuse to write - did you give me the executed pages?

 Dear Kay,
 
As of this afternoon, we have not received Enron's original signature pages

office?  If so, please advise as to how they were sent and the expected date 
of delivery; if not, please let me know when you will be able to send them.

Portland team wants to sign the documents.

Kay:

The original membership certificate needs to be in the lender's hands
(i.e.,
Isabel Parker's office) on Wednesday in order to release escrow.  If you
have the original to me by Tuesday, I can forward it to Isabel by overnight
delivery for Wednesday.  It must be an original, in that the lender's lien
on the membership interest is not perfected without possession of the
original certificate.  With respect to the remaining documents, fax copies
of signature pages on the closing date should be sufficient.

The problem is in getting the original in their hands (where?) by tomorrow.
Does it have to be an original?

Kay

Kay:

Can we at least get the membership certificates signed by Tuesday?  This
seems to be the only document required in advance of closing.  If we can't
get the 80% membership interest certificate in the lender's possession on
the closing date, then there is a lien perfection issue for them to deal
with, and I thought we could accommodate their request and avoid the
problem
altogether.  Please advise, as Greg and Isabel will be calling within an
hour or so to finalize the mechanics on this.  Thanks.

I've asked GE for the LOC by Wednesday, but I haven't gotten a response.

I'll have difficulty getting executed docs by Tuesday, since sigs are
coming from Portland.  I'll have to check to see what can be done.

Kay

Kay:

Can you get executed documents back to me on Tuesday?  Greg has requested
that we send the original membership certificate representing the 80%
interest to the collateral agent Tuesday night by overnight delivery to
hold
in escrow until closing, in order that the collateral agent is in
possession
of the certificate (for purposes of legal opinions) upon closing on
Wednesday.  Greg is planning to fax signature pages of all of their closing
documents later today.  (I will be out of the office at a meeting with
another client most of the afternoon today).

There is one last question with GE dealing with the letter of credit for
the
retention amount, as this affects our disbursement instruction letter.  I
advised Greg that GE's normal practice was to send the retention L/C after
receipt of payment.  He is considering this, but may want to talk to GE
about the ability to present the L/C at closing.  Do you have any thoughts
on this?

I suspect they are accustomed to people wanting to structure for an MTM deal 
from a commercial standpoint.  Doesn't sound like our objective here.

ckm

Kay -- The comments in the attached doc relate primarily to accrual vs. MTM 
accounting.  They seem to be recommending repeatedly that our language covers 
an accrual accounting deal, and does not work for MTM accounting.  Is this 
assumption correct, or am I missing the point?  Please let me know what you 
think.  Thanks -- David

For future reference on the long term deal.

need to make alternative arrangements for signature.  Otherwise Paul
Hastings will be forced to renegotiate its legal opinion with Freshfields,
and we owe them the courtesy of letting them know this first thing Tuesday
morning, as I indicated to them as early as Thursday of last week that we
had no objection to getting at least the original membership certificate to
them by overnight delivery prior to closing to hold in escrow until the
closing, in order to satisfy opinion issues associated with perfection of
the lien on the membership interest.  Please let me know.  Thanks.

The Commission issued its procedural order, as expected, on August 2.  It
reads just like the draft, except that the Commission did not include the
date for proposed orders that we requested.  We can still make that request
at the evidentiary hearing.

      The public and evidentiary hearing is scheduled to begin
Monday, October 2, 2000 at 2:00 pm
      Petitions to intervene are due by September 8;  
      intervenor testimony by September 15; 
      ENA rebuttal by September 27.

CP & L vigorously opposed the interventions in its merger and holding
company documents;  we are going through those filings and roughing out an
opposition to its intervention here should it decide to do so.  I am
checking with the Public Staff on the status of their discovery requests.

You sound like Carlos.

Hi John,

It would probably be better for me if we could reschedule, since I will be
out of town Wed-Mon.

Rain check?

Good morning.

In order to finish up Delta/Salmon tomorrow, please note we need the 
following today:

GE parent guaranty
LOC (so that full payment can be made to GE tomorrow)
Opinion of counsel

And once funds are received by GE, we need the receipt of funds letter.

Lee, I haven't heard back from the Portland gang to find out if the LV Co Gen 
contract is ready.  Maybe Jake can help shake that loose.

Thanks,

Kay

It depends on what time I get the signatures.  If I can get things signed u=
p=20
quickly, I'll have them delivered to you in plenty of time for you to send=
=20
the docs.  I would prefer that it work that way. =20

Chris Calger is in our offices today  - a terrific break.  Now if I can jus=
t=20
find him.  Plus, I thought I would have him sign the escrow disbursement=20
letter instead of Jake, since he's here.

Kay

Kay:

I agree as to the original deliverables.  However, for the GE Turbine
Contract, an officer of the LLC who is named on the Secretary's certificate
(i.e., Duran, Calger or Thomas) should sign.  Just to be safe, we may also
want the M/D of the LLC who is named on the Secretary's certificate (i.e.,
Duran) to sign the LLC membership certificates. =20

Will you be sending the originals to me to forward to Freshfields and Paul
Hastings?

Here's what I have on my list as original deliverables

GE turbine contract - any officer of LLC
Amended LLC- any officer of ENA
Membership certificates - signed by MD of LLC, which isn't Jake

The only things I have which MUST be signed by Jake are the written
consents of the LLC, which aren't on the original deliverable list.  These
will be ready first thing Wednesday am.

I'm sorry,  I don't recall you telling me that the original membership
certificates had to be in New York on Wednesday. However, we will be able
to handle this.

This pre-closing drill is why I asked for a definitive, signed off  closing
list by mid-day Friday.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay:

It won't be a big deal if we can get these documents into Federal Express
Tuesday night for delivery Wednesday as indicated below.  If there is a
chance that Jake will be late so as to miss the Fed Ex deadline, then we
need to make alternative arrangements for signature.  Otherwise Paul
Hastings will be forced to renegotiate its legal opinion with Freshfields,
and we owe them the courtesy of letting them know this first thing Tuesday
morning, as I indicated to them as early as Thursday of last week that we
had no objection to getting at least the original membership certificate to
them by overnight delivery prior to closing to hold in escrow until the
closing, in order to satisfy opinion issues associated with perfection of
the lien on the membership interest.  Please let me know.  Thanks.

As soon as I get back to the office, I will re-check the Salmon resolutions
electing officers to confirm Chris Calger's title with Salmon and will let
you know.

I think we will be able to get the documents you listed signed tomorrow,
but Jake won't be here before 7pm, so anything he is signing won't be ready
until Wednesday am.  It seems to me that this isn't a big deal, but I would
appreciate it if you could confirm.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay:

The original membership certificate for the 80% interest should be
forwarded
for delivery on Wednesday, May 2, to the following address:

           Ms. Isabel Parker
           Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP
           520 Madison Avenue, 34th Floor
           New York, NY  10022
           (phone 212-277-4025)

(Greg has asked that the membership certificate be faxed to him (fax
203-674-7646) and me (fax 713-751-3280) on Tuesday before depositing this
with the overnight courier).

If you will also be sending the original signature pages to the Turbine
Contract and the Amended and Restated LLC Agreement, these documents should
be forwarded for delivery on Wednesday, May 2, to:

           Mr. Gregory F. Lang
           Paul Hastings Janofsky & Walker LLP
           1055 Washington Blvd.
           Stamford, CT  06901
           (phone 203-961-7446)

I am happy to get these documents to the correct place if the signed
documents are in Houston on Tuesday.  Let me know.  Thanks.

Please confirm absolutely that fax signatures will be sufficient.

I need the address of where to send the membership certificate.  There is
not enough time for the document to pass back through Houston if the
Portland team wants to sign the documents.

Kay

Kay:

The original membership certificate needs to be in the lender's hands
(i.e.,
Isabel Parker's office) on Wednesday in order to release escrow.  If you
have the original to me by Tuesday, I can forward it to Isabel by overnight
delivery for Wednesday.  It must be an original, in that the lender's lien
on the membership interest is not perfected without possession of the
original certificate.  With respect to the remaining documents, fax copies
of signature pages on the closing date should be sufficient.

ccampbell@kslaw.com <mailto:ccampbell@kslaw.com>

The problem is in getting the original in their hands (where?) by tomorrow.
Does it have to be an original?

Kay

Kay:

Can we at least get the membership certificates signed by Tuesday?  This
seems to be the only document required in advance of closing.  If we can't
get the 80% membership interest certificate in the lender's possession on
the closing date, then there is a lien perfection issue for them to deal
with, and I thought we could accommodate their request and avoid the
problem
altogether.  Please advise, as Greg and Isabel will be calling within an
hour or so to finalize the mechanics on this.  Thanks.

I've asked GE for the LOC by Wednesday, but I haven't gotten a response.

I'll have difficulty getting executed docs by Tuesday, since sigs are
coming from Portland.  I'll have to check to see what can be done.

Kay

Kay:

Can you get executed documents back to me on Tuesday?  Greg has requested
that we send the original membership certificate representing the 80%
interest to the collateral agent Tuesday night by overnight delivery to
hold
in escrow until closing, in order that the collateral agent is in
possession
of the certificate (for purposes of legal opinions) upon closing on
Wednesday.  Greg is planning to fax signature pages of all of their closing
documents later today.  (I will be out of the office at a meeting with
another client most of the afternoon today).

There is one last question with GE dealing with the letter of credit for
the
retention amount, as this affects our disbursement instruction letter.  I
advised Greg that GE's normal practice was to send the retention L/C after
receipt of payment.  He is considering this, but may want to talk to GE
about the ability to present the L/C at closing.  Do you have any thoughts
on this?

Duran is fine. I had it in my mind that Calger had signed the incumbancy=20
cert.  My mistake.

I'm trying to set up a closing table and have these guys sign this am befor=

Kay

Kay:

The person signing the escrow instruction must be someone who is listed on
the incumbency certificate that we previously submitted to Citibank (i.e.,
Thomas or Duran).  Can we change the signatory to Duran as opposed to
Calger?

(I suppose we have the same issue with PPL, as Vicens is not named on PPL's
incumbency certificate and Citibank already raised that issue for them on
the escrow agreement.  I will let Greg Lang know.)

Hi Lupe,

I heard a rumor that Tribasa had found somebody to buy out the loan.  Another 
victim, perhaps?

I can't imagine how you must have felt to get a call from Don.  Maybe he's 
looking for a new opportunity in Mexico, since Bufete didn't pan out.

I've been busy working on a read deal with some very bright commercial 
people.  It is very challenging.  Sometimes I feel so uninformed.  This is a 
nice change! I feel like it is elevating my professional development.

I ran into Chip recently.  He seems happier now that he has Erik's old job.

More hugs -

Hi Kay, how is life in Enron? I thought about you yesterday because I ran
into our Tribasa friends, and among other things they told me they were
going to pay Enron today the remaining 100% of the loan!! I still cannot
believe it! Anyway, something must be going on, because belive it or not,
Don has been calling me, which I find somewhat disturbing. Maybe he doesnt
remember I dont work for him anymore!
Well hope everything is going well.
Big hug. Lupe.

Greg and Kay:

I have enclosed clean and blacklined copies of the escrow disbursement
instruction letter, marked to reflect changes from the draft previously
circulated for signature.  The only revisions were to change the persons
named to sign this letter to be individuals who are available and who were
named as authorized on the respective incumbency certificate previously
submitted to Citibank, and to delete the bracketed information on the first
page of the letter addressing the GE letter of credit, as this is expected
to be available by fax on Wednesday.  Please ensure that the signature page
of this letter is signed and ready  to transmit to Citibank by fax upon
closing on Wednesday.

If no one has an objection, I will send a draft of this document to Estelle
Lawrence at Citibank today in order that she can be preparing to receive the
signed copy by fax tomorrow.   Thanks.

Isabel and Greg,

I'm having a logistical problem.  The only managing director of Salmon is not 
in the office today.  I can have the membership certificates signed by (1) a 
vice president or (1)  the managing member or (3) elect a new managing 
director.  What's your preference?

I know that GE recently had a small comment, technical or scope related,  but 
I don't recall if it was before or after the 24th. I was unaware of Tom's 
involvement, so I want to make sure the comment was addressed.  

I'm happy to hand the reins over to someone else to handle signature.  I 
suspect I'm creating confusion as well.

Kay

Yes Kay.  It shlould be the last version from Peter Thompson of AK sent April 
24th.  Tom Constantine and I just left Peter a voice mail to ask him to 
resend to Tom for a double check.  I wil ask Tom to forward it to you.  I 
have nothing to add to these contracts, and want to get out of the loop to 
eliminate confusion.

This does not mean I will not help or answer any questions, just that Dale 
has asked Tom to act in Dale's place on this, and I don't want to screw 
things up....

TOM - when received or confirmed from Peter, would you please send a copy to 
Kay Mann as well (as requested below).

Could you email me the last version of the turbine contract?

If it will help, I will see if I can find the last version transmitted to

GE Breakout agreement for the LVCII project to Lisa.Bills@enron.com and 
Roseann.Engeldorf@ENRON.com 

We anticipate that it will be necessary to modify the GE Agreement per 
comments that would be transmitted by Rose or Lisa and would ask that the 
document be turned around as quickly as possible.

If you have any questions you can reach me at 904 630 5376.

One comment which was taken related to the applicable change in law date.

Kay: The issue has arisen as to whether the current draft of the GE contract 
incorporated comments of Rose Engeldorf and Lisa Bills.  I want to make sure 
that Rose and Lisa have the current draft, and for that reason have asked 
Peter to send it out.  The plan is for Peter to maintain control of the 
document as he has in the past and to re-issue a draft that incorporates the 
comments.

   I know that GE recently had a small comment, technical or scope
related,  but I don't recall if it was before or after the 24th. I was
unaware of Tom's involvement, so I want to make sure the comment was
addressed.  

   I'm happy to hand the reins over to someone else to handle
signature.  I suspect I'm creating confusion as well.

   Kay

   Subject:   RE:  

   Yes Kay.  It shlould be the last version from Peter Thompson of
AK sent April 24th.  Tom Constantine and I just left Peter a voice mail
to ask him to resend to Tom for a double check.  I wil ask Tom to
forward it to you.  I have nothing to add to these contracts, and want
to get out of the loop to eliminate confusion.

   This does not mean I will not help or answer any questions, just
that Dale has asked Tom to act in Dale's place on this, and I don't want
to screw things up....

   TOM - when received or confirmed from Peter, would you please
send a copy to Kay Mann as well (as requested below).

Gentlemen,

Any progress on the summary?

Thanks,

Kay

Thanks.  I'm in DC (actually, Richmond VA) with Nancy Wodka working on a 
PPA.  I haven't opened the attachment yet due to the length of time it takes 
over this connection, and the late hour.

You may have addressed this in your email, but as I recall you were going to 
work on a summary of the restricted activities, as a foundation for the 
document anticipated by the LLC agreement.  Any luck with that?

I'll be in touch shortly.  Thanks for keeping track.

Kay

I sent this email from GE to Dale/Bill after I received it.  Since Peter's 
last draft was April 24, I'm I assume this wasn't included:

Kay/Bill,

Bill says he agrees and accepts our comments to the A&A.

One change required to the Rev 5 document.  In Exhibit B, Add item "27)One
additional Human Machine Interface (HMI) per Unit (desktop PC type)"

Include these changes and we can get this done tomorrow.

Thanks,

Lee

This is the same version you sent today, right?

Kent,

Are you sending this (and the opinion and LOC) to me today? I wasn't sure 
where this landed.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay:

We told Paul Hastings that we would release our Guaranty and the Opinion at
closing on Wednesday.  They were okay with that.  If that's a problem, I can
fax the guaranty and opinion (once I have it signed), with a letter from me
saying you can't release it until funding...

Good morning.

In order to finish up Delta/Salmon tomorrow, please note we need the
following today:

GE parent guaranty
LOC (so that full payment can be made to GE tomorrow)
Opinion of counsel

And once funds are received by GE, we need the receipt of funds letter.

Lee, I haven't heard back from the Portland gang to find out if the LV Co
Gen contract is ready.  Maybe Jake can help shake that loose.

Thanks,

Kay

Could you get me that cert of sec ASAP?  I need to get this stuff to Carolyn 
soon.

Kay

In conversations with GE, it is their understanding that their guaranty will 
not be transmitted until there is a fed ref number tomorrow.  The opinion 
letter will be faxed as soon as the GC is available, or Kent can sign for Dan 
Rowley if that is acceptable.  DRowley can sign originals on Thursday.

The LOC is in the works, and GE understands that 10% will be retained in 
escrow until the LOC is delivered.

There will be three original opinions.  There is one original guaranty, and 
I'm not certain of GE's willingness to give more than that.  Obviously, there 
will be only one LOC.

Kay

I know Michael wants to go to your apt this afternoon.  If you do go there, 
just give me a call to let me know you're there so we can coordinate pickup.

See you soon,

Kay

Hi Karen,

Did I mess up?  I saw Herman and he told me that the 1000am was held.  I hope 
I wasn't supposed to be there.

Please call if I can help.

what do you think?
Paige Record <recordp@southwestern.edu> on 05/01/2001 02:41:00 PM
OK... I told y'all that I was going to leave ASAP for Waco. I am out
Thursday night at 9:00 PM. I would be happy to move all my stuff home on
Friday, but neither one of you can come up that early. Last time we moved
out, Neil had everything pretty much out of the car by the time you and I
got home. So, I didn't think it would be that different, except I wouldn't
be there to organize my stuff. I guess I can come home Friday with as much
stuff as I can fit in my car and then back up Saturday with y'all to put
the big stuff in one of our big cars. I thought you knew exactly what I was
planning. Basically, Tim and Abbey are waiting on me to be done to leave,
so I am trying to get moved out quickly. Mikey gets out Wednesday night as
well, I think, so he has to move all of his stuff back on Thursday. I
wasn't going to ask him to go from College Station to Houston to here to
Houston to Waco for me. Plus his car is pretty small anyway. He will be
more than willing to help put big stuff in the car on Saturday, I'm sure.
Anyway, so do you want me to come home with all I can on Friday, and then
all of us come up on Saturday? I can just pack all my crap that will fit in
the car on Thursday night after I finish finals. That would mean y'all
moving my big stuff without me when you get back to Houston on Saturday.
But I don't usually help with that stuff anyway (i.e. my couch, trunk,
patio furniture)

 Pursuant to Kay Mann's instructions, attached please find a
clean copy of the most recent version of the City of Austin Agreement
(the second document below), as well as a blackline showing changes from
the last version circulated on December 14.  The Agreement deletes
references to specific performance guarantees for combined cycle plants.
The Agreement now has the exhibits rolled in. To complete the agreement,
we need to include the date of execution, the addresses and contacts for
Sections 25.1 and 25.3, and Exhibit H-2.

Isabel and Greg:

Attached is an escrow instruction letter authorizing you to hold the
documents referenced in the memorandum in trust until the closing
transaction.

Jaap, you are authorized to fax the documents that you have to Isabel at 212
277 4001 and to Greg at 203-359-3031.  As the funding is contingent on them
seeing our fax documents first, we will have to send them now (or no later
than 9 CST) or the funding doesn't occur.

Call me if you have any questions.

This seems fine.  You might want to add the GE acknowledgement of receipt of
funds, which, as we are holding documents in escrow until monies are
received by GE, can also now be signed in advance.
As to the opinion, we would prefer it to be executed by Dan Rowley or
yourself, rather than by you per personam Dan Rowley.
Let me know if this is possible

Can we not fax the document to Dan Rowley and ask him to fax it back to us?
That way he doesn't need to print it out.  Alternatively, do you have
authority to issue the opinion yourself?

administrative problem.  Dan Rowley cannot get to a printer in time.  Can I
sign Dan Rowley name by Kent shoemaker and fax it out to you.

That is fine but if you can also fax the documents to me at the same time at
212 277 4001, that would be good.
I agree with the Escrow Letter in principle - who would you want to sign
such a letter? Presumably Salmon, as beneficiary of the guarantee?
Thanks
Isabel

Greg Lang at Paul Hastings has requested that the fax documents be sent to
him.  Is that okay?  I need to create an Escrow Letter that says the
documents cannot be released until funding.  I don't want a guaranty out
there without a closing.

Our credit documentation provides that Pegasus shall not cause any monies to
be released from the Turbine Escrow Account until all relevant documentation
has been executed and delivered, namely:

(i) GE consent 
(ii) GE opinion
(iii) Turbine Contract
(iv) Security Agreement 
(v) Promissory Note
(vi) Amended Salmon LLC Agreement
(vii) GE Parent Guarantee.

The lenders consequently expect to see an executed (faxed if necessary) copy
of all of the above (including the GE Parent Guarantee) prior to release of
funds from the Escrow Account.

I humbly beg your forgiveness for not calling you.  Now I owe you.

I will check my directory to see what I have.  As I recall it was part of 
some special scratch my back I'll scratch yours deal, although the details 
now escape me.  Seems like there were some minor defects which could be 
repaired while GE stored the stuff, so we let them put the stuff in storage 
based on their rep things would get fixed.

Project is Eletrobolt.   ESA has had GE send the stacks for the Electrobolt 
LM6000 back to Braden for modifications necessary for Eletrobolt and there 
are a couple other changes.

I need to prepare an amendment cover those changes as well a capture the in 
and out costs related to the Eletrobolt units.  Matt T told me that Ben 
signed out a letter prepared by Kay addressing an agreement related to 
storage of the units that was different from the 24 pack base contract.  Matt 
says he does not have the letter.   

I would be very helpful if I could have a copy of the letter so I understand 
the changes so I do not upset the prior deal. Once I have the amendment 
prepared in addition to the Eletrobolt team review, I would like to bounce 
off Ben and Kay to ensure I have not harm to other aspects of the 24 pack 
purchase.

Thanks

Greg and Kay:

I have enclosed clean and blacklined copies of the escrow disbursement
instruction letter, marked to reflect changes from the draft previously
circulated for signature.  The only revisions were to change the persons
named to sign this letter to be individuals who are available and who were
named as authorized on the respective incumbency certificate previously
submitted to Citibank, and to delete the bracketed information on the first
page of the letter addressing the GE letter of credit, as this is expected
to be available by fax on Wednesday.  Please ensure that the signature page
of this letter is signed and ready  to transmit to Citibank by fax upon
closing on Wednesday.

If no one has an objection, I will send a draft of this document to Estelle
Lawrence at Citibank today in order that she can be preparing to receive the
signed copy by fax tomorrow.   Thanks.

Kay,

I don't know the answer to your 1st question since I don't recall ever
having to have insurance certificates on any of the other Facility
Agreements.  Maybe we did, but I just forgot that detail.  Jaap/Kent? do yo=
u
know?

The Retention LC was faxed this am to Greg Lang and Isabell Parker.  Jaap's
Admin Asst can fax you a copy (Carla Corly) if you wish.

Also, need to talk about Austin Tech reps being added to Facility Agreement
asap (Mike Storm says they've worked out 1700 hours with Eric Booth).  But
we need something in the interim that confirms this will be added into the
Austin Facility Agreement (e-mail to me OK).

Regards,

Hi Kay,
 
I was able to pull a few strings for you in regards to your upcoming trip.  
Our group rates are only valid for six or more guests traveling together and 
upon review of there only being three confirmed guests in your weekend group 
getaway standard rate rates would have applied. After much begging I was able 
to have the group rates honored for you.  
 
I hope you enjoy your stay and I look forward to meeting you.  
 
Have a great day!

Herman, this is the document I called you about.  AE is out-of-pocket, and 
has some questions about this agreement, so she asked me to forward the doc.  
This is a doc for a 40 yr ground lease for a power plant.  It is my 
understanding that the counterparty is not interested in an option 
arrangement.

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center and Metropolitan garage are 
being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Sky Ring access is 
available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be 
used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You may enter & exit on Clay St. and Bell St., also pedestrians, will have 
to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Please respond via e-mail if you are interested in acquiring one of these 
spaces.

The  memo was very helpful.  It would be great to meet in person and discuss 
issues. I'm out of town now, but I believe either the 8th or 9th would be 
great.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay,

I got your email about the 1 month contract, and I hope you got a memo last 
Friday from John Brunini giving you our research to date. I may be in Houston 
next week (probably the 8th or 9th) and possibly again early the following 
week. Would it make sense for us to try to visit on this matter when I'm in 
town? If so, when might you be available?

Wilson

John,

I suggest eliminating the statement in III that we are proposing to perform 
the the market price servises in accordance with the terms of the market 
price service agreement.  I realized that we have a disclaimer at the end of 
the letter, but the statement in III seems to directly contradict the 
disclaimer.

I am not confident that the statement that the Enron structure is proprietary 
is sufficient to protect the information.  I will need to check the 
confidentiality agreement when I get to the office if this is a real 
concern.  

I thought we weren't submitting a conforming bid.  Is there anything in the 
RFP which indicates that any proposal will be considered a firm offer, or 
anything to that effect?

Talk to you soon,

Kay

Nancy,

Please incorporate this language from Enron's Tax Guys.

Thanks,

Kay
	
	

Heather:

My recommendation is that we "tighten up" tax  language in the ENA - Virginia 
Electric and Power Company ("VEPCO") Power Purchase & Sale Agreement.  Below 
please find my recommendations.  Please note that the New Tax burden is upon 
VEPCO.  This is in keeping with our standard power contracts.

1) Replace the "Tax" definition with the following:

"Taxes"  means any or all ad valorem, property, occupation, severance, 
generation, first use, conservation, Btu or energy, transmission, utility, 
gross receipts, privilege, sales, use, consumption, excise, lease, 
transaction, and other taxes, governmental charges, licenses, fees, permits 
and assessment, or increases therein, other than taxes based on net income or 
net worth.

2) Insert definition for "New Taxes":

"New Taxes"  means (i) any Taxes enacted and effective after the Effective 
Date, including, without limitation, that portion of any Taxes or New Taxes 
that constitutes an increase, or (ii) any law, order, rule or regulation, or 
interpretation thereof, enacted and effective after the Effective Date 
resulting in the application of any Taxes to a new or different class of 
parties or transactions.

3) Replace Sec. 11.2 with the following:

Applicable Taxes  The Contract Price shall include full reimbursement for, 
and Seller is liable for and shall pay, or cause to be paid, or reimburse 
Buyer if Buyer has paid, all Taxes applicable to a Transaction arising prior 
to the Delivery Point. If Buyer is required to remit such Tax, the amount 
shall be deducted from any sums due to Seller.  Seller shall indemnify, 
defend and hold harmless Buyer from any Claims for such Taxes.  The Contract 
Price does not include reimbursement for, and Buyer is liable for and shall 
pay, cause to be paid, or reimburse Seller if Seller has paid, all Taxes 
applicable to a Transaction arising at and from the Delivery Point, including 
any Taxes imposed or collected by a taxing authority with jurisdiction over 
Buyer.  Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller from any 
Claims for such Taxes. Either Party, upon written request of the other, shall 
provide a certificate of exemption or other reasonably satisfactory evidence 
of exemption if either Party is exempt from taxes, and shall use reasonable 
efforts to obtain and cooperate with obtaining any exemption from or 
reduction of any Tax.  Each Party shall use reasonable efforts to administer 
this Agreement and implement the provisions in accordance with the intent to 
minimize Taxes.  Buyer shall be responsible for all New Taxes.

I spoke to Tom Loberg of Montana Power today regarding the status of our 
discussions on the D5A. He advised me that part of their merger deal with 
Northwestern Corp required that projects such as the one contemplated for the 
D5A required the approval of Northwestern's board. Montana presented the 
project to Northwestern's board today, but the board declined to grant such 
approval. Tom declined to provide me any further insight.

We will of course immediately begin to pursue other sales opportunities for 
this turbine. FYI, our exclusivity agreement with Northwestern expires 
tomorrow.

Sounds fine.

Kay:

George Kutzschbach of Fulbright called this afternoon to request copies of
the executed Assignment and Assumption Agreements and Bills of Sale for the
turbine/transformer transaction between ENA and Sweetgum Energy LP.  George
has unsigned copies of these documents.  Our closing volumes also contain
only unsigned copies of these documents.   

George is asking for the documents with respect to both the turbines and the
transformer, but is needing them specifically for the transformer.
Apparently, CA-II is planning to sell the transformer, and he is gathering
up the documents that would show title to the transformer in CA-II.  

I have reviewed the documents, and do not see any reason why we should not
deliver them.  Can you provide signed copies of these documents?   Thanks.

Well, here's the nearly final draft of what was submitted.  Evidently, we 
decided to submit a bid on the original transaction structure, as well as two 
alternatives. (not what I was lead to believe before.)  I spoke with John 
about adding more disclaimer language to the letter to say that by submitting 
the bid we aren't agreeing to enter into a transaction or even negotiate for 
a transaction.  Also, I advised him that the confidentiality statements in

Sounds like gas to me.

Kay
Gregg: In late 1999, the ICC Staff conducted an informal "workshop"
regarding a proposed set of affiliate transaction rules for gas utilities.
Enron Energy Services, peoples and others filed comments. Based on the
comments, Staff circulated a proposed rule but there was no immediate
follow-up. The Commission issued a notice indicating that it would further
review the matter after its January, 2000 gas policy meeting. Thereafter,
in August, 2000, the ICC Staff submiited a Report recommending that a rule
be adopted. On Sept. 22, 2000, the rule was published for "first notice" in
the Illinois Register. The ICC also initiated Docket 00-0586 to review the
rules. In Docket 00-0586, the assigned Hearing Examiner determined that no
hearings would be held to review the rules. As a result, only written
comments were considered. Several parties (including Peoples/North Shore)
filed comments (although Enron did not). The Examiner issued a Proposed
Order on April 23, which-if adopted-would direct publication of the rules
for "second notice" (45 days for the Joint Comm. on Admin. Rules to comment
before final effectiveness). The issues raised by the comment s are
summarized in the Proposed Order. Exceptions to the Proposed Order (i.e.,
comments regarding the proposed decision) are due May 11 and replies to
Excpetions are due May 18. The Examiner did not attach the modified rule,
but notes that the few changes made to Staff's initial draft are discussed
in the order. I will fax to you the Proposed Order and Staff initial draft
rule. The next step in the process is ICC review of the Proposed Order,
followed presumably by Illinois Register Publicaion of the adopted rule.

Rey,

This email explains why Jeff and I tried calling you this am. Any comments?

Thanks,

Kay

Brian,

I see from Jeff's email that splitting the contracts was an Enron request, 
and GE is amenable to a single contract.  From a legal standpoint, the single 
contract would be the preferred approach for an owner like Enron.  In 
speaking with Jeff Blumenthal, he was unaware of a tax advantage to Enron to 
have the split; however, he is going to confer with others to verify.  
Perhaps there is an Enron reason for the split which I am not aware of.

As for the parent guaranty issue, will GE require an Enron guaranty if the 
contract is to be assigned to the contractor, and if not, can the Enron 
guaranty be replaced upon assignment?

Thanks,

Kay

Brian D Barto@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
06/02/2000 09:04 AM
Kay, can you help me grapple with these comments.

I will forward Jeffs last email which is relative to his comment that I did 
not address his comments to clause 10

They are against this file:

jeffreye.smith@ps.ge.com on 06/02/2000 06:55:35 AM
Brian,
Here are my comments on several items.
* The consolidation agreement.
* In 1.b, thanks for reflecting the GE suggestion.  However, near the
end of the paragraph, the word "remedy" should move to immediately after
"exclusive".
* In 8, the reference should be to paragraph 10.a, not 11.a.
* In 10.a, it does not look like the wording in my 30/May/00 e-mail
was picked up.
* In 12 and 13, Enron has added new wording since the preceding
issuance of this document.
* In 13, is all of this wording necessary and applicable.  At the end
of the first long sentence, the word "turnkey" is used.  Of course, this is
an equipment supply contract for GE.
   Also, I believe the contracts do state what is in GE
scope via clauses 1.27, 1.86 and 3.1.  So, the last sentence is redundant.
* More importantly, these two clauses could be interpreted as
establishing a GEPS/GEIOC consortium.  This is something GE had advocated as
the approach in a single contract, for tax purposes, in Mexico.  GE can
still go either way, although the single document approach is more
straightforward (and that is what we initialed, as a complete document, in
your offices last month).  Enron wanted split contracts.  These clauses may
undo what Enron was attempting to achieve in this regard.
* In 14, which has been added by Enron in the latest version of the
consolidation agreement, the GE entities seem to be prevented from getting
an extension of time under one contract if there is a problem with
performance under the other.  This is contrary to the words in the former
Enron clause 5, which has now been eliminated.  This clause 14 should be
removed.
* Regarding the "swap" payments for tax purposes, to benefit both
Enron and GE:
* The amount paid to date on the Monterrey unit, under the MOU, is
$25,101,733.  What GE proposes it to:
* Revise the payment schedule for the contracts such that payments
totaling this amount are due 2-3 days after contract signing.
* Execute a separate letter, to be signed at the same time as the
contracts, formally dissolving the MOU.  The letter would call for GE to
refund this same amount 2-3 days after receipt of the payment under the
contracts.
    We need to draft this letter, which will
hopefully be one page.  The text of such a letter could include the
following wording:
    "Pursuant to clause 30.3 of the now executed
On and Off Shore contracts for this project, the MOU dated ______ is made
null and void.  Once the initial payment(s) called for in said contracts
have been made, the monies in the amount of $25,101,733.00, which were paid
under the MOU will be refunded to (Enron entity)."
* This would get the monies to the appropriate Enron and GE entities.

  In a related matter, since the legal Enron entity has
changed, GE requests a parent guarantee (using form already shown in the
contract(s)).
Regards,
Jeff Smith

 << File: Mac Word 3.0 >>

Kay and Jeff:

Please review and comment.  Kay's comments are included and do not look
unreasonable.  Jeff please edit this document and send back to Kay and I to
see
what you are thinking about in the clause that used to be 11, now 10, I
think.

(See attached file: GE Vitro WRAP rev 2.doc)

Matt, 

Our preference is to sign this before June 19.  I recall that Herman is out. 
Do you know when he will be back?

I will make sure that you and Herman get a copy of the next draft.  It won't 
be this week.

Kay  

Scott's done the difficult part and generated something for review.  I've 
added my comments.  Sheila, would you like to add your 2 cents worth?

Thanks,

Kay

1400 Smith.

Morning would probably be better for me.  

Kay

Looks like I will be in Houston tomorrow ( Wed.) and would like to come by to 
meet you and to discuss the Clarksdale contract. I'm tied up in the middle of 
the day, but will probably have time early (9 or 10 am) or in the afternoon. 

Please let me know your availability and we'll set something up. I assume 
you're on Smith St. downtown.

Business casual is the order of the day here.  Ties are definitely not 
necessary.

Are you spending the night downtown?  If so, you may want to just park at the 
hotel.  Lots of the streets downtown are under construction, so I'm a little 
hesitant to give directions.  Enron is located fairly close to the Hyatt, and 
their garage is easy to find.  Enron just opened a new parking garage, but 
I'm not sure if it is open for visitors yet.  Alternatively,  the Allen 
Center Garage is connected to the Enron building via an above-street walkway.

If it was me and I was working and staying downtown, I would take a taxi.  
This is partly because I have an under-developed sense of direction, and 
partly because of the construction downtown.

Hope this helps.

Kay

My flight is scheduled to arrive at Hobby at 7:45 am, and I plan to rent a 
car. I assume I can get downtown by 9 to 9:30. Would that be OK? I assume we 
can finish our business within an hour. 

Any special instructions on where to go in your building? Also, if my other 
business does not require a coat and tie, does your office observe business 
casual dress like so many others?

I accused Carlos of being a deal killer.

we are to the point of deciding critical issues, I believe Sheila's input is 
essential, and worth waiting for.

ckm

   
	
	

Sheila will not be in a position to participate in the World Hunger call 
tomorrow.  She will call in if possible, but she doesn't want anyone to hold 
up progress if she doesn't participate.

To prepare for the call, Sheila would like the five of you to meet for a 
strategy session to collect and discuss Enron's remaining issues.

Are you available to meet this afternoon at 2 o'clock?   Suzanne reserved 
conference room EB 3824 from 2:00 to 4:00 this afternoon.  

Take care,
Ed

P.S.
Peter, I'll make sure the group has your phone number when they meet.

I'd still like to sit in when my commercial team hears it, if possible.  
Plus, I suspect we run the risk this week of getting very bogged down.

ckm

No, John wants to bring all his people, so I think we will do another one of 
these next week.  One more seat at this one is not going to help him much.

Rose

  
I can give up my seat and sit in with  the commercial team, if that helps.

ckm

No room at this one.  Maybe next week.  We are rapidly running out of room - 
even for Schwartzenburg's folks!

Rose
How about commercial folks?

We are planning a presentation on certain structure and contracting issues 
related to power plant asset financing on Thursday, May 10th.  The 
presentation will include lunch from Treebeard's and will begin at 11:30.  We 
have scheduled 2.5 hours for the presentation; it may be shorter, depending 
on the number of questions. 

We plan to include the Portland folks by video-conference.   If you know of 
others who would benefit from this presentation, please pass on this 
invitation; I have not intended to exclude anyone who may want to attend.  If 
there are others at remote locations, please let me or Dina Snow know so that 
we can arrange for video-conferencing.  John, I asked Shirley for the names 
of your contracts folks and have included them; I still have no information 
as to whom else you want to include.  Therefore, please forward this to your 
team members as you see fit.

Please RSVP to Dina Snow at X57099 or by e-mail to dina.snow@enron.com by 
Tuesday, May 8th.

We will e-mail the conference room location when it is confirmed.

Thanks,

Rose

Steve/Christian,

The attached file is a draft of an asset management agreement prepared by Stu 
Zisman.  The later version obviously contained more negotiated points, so I 
think this one is more helpful.

I'm working on a transaction now which involves serving load as well as 
selling power. I found this one helpful for issue identification and 
exculpatory language, however.  

Kay

Allyson,

As you know, we have had discussions with the City of Rocky Mount regarding 
possibly buying gas from them for the new power plant in Edgecombe County.  
Evidently, the gas company has figured this out, and is not happy with this 
prospect.  We would like your opinion concerning the City's ability to (a) 
require that a tap be made so that the power plant be served and (b) sell gas 
to Enron for this purpose.  When considering these issues, please assume that 
the City would own and annex the land, and lease it to an Enron entity.

We will need the gas by next March or April, so time is critical.  Should the 
gas company decline, what is the appeal process and how long can it be 
expected to take?  Do you  have any suggestions for expediting the process?

I am having the contracts between the gas company and the City sent to you, 
and you should have them by Monday.

Thank you for your assistance,

Kay 

Wilson Montjoy will be in our offices, probably starting around 830 or 900.

Any progress?

No, I believe it is one of TECO's subs, but I'm not sure.

This gives you the gist of it.  Since it was a GE generated letter I will 
need to check for the final hard copy.

1.0  John A and Armando.

My question and John's response has led me down the following merry chase:

The LM6000 contract has GE keeping risk of loss and damage until delivery to 
the Delivery Point.   The Delivery Point is Jacinto Port.   Without any other 
documents, GE has delivered the equipment and Risk of Loss and Damage is 
Brazilian Trust's.   I understand that some deal was cut in a letter that Ben 
Jacoby sent to GE where GE keeps the ROL while in storage, but there are some 
storage costs.

(Note:) We have a very painful experience on a turbine from another vendor 
where the point and time of transfer of risk of loss is a central issue to a 
dispute at hand.) 

I think we need clear documentation making it clear that GE has ROL for the 
equipment until we take it out of storage.

As it relates to NEPCO if I understand it correctly the risk of loss chain is 
as follows: GE delivers to the Jacinto port where Risk of loss transfers to 
Brazilian Trust,  Brazilian Trust delivers to the port  and keeps risk of 
loss until Ex Terra, at which point risk of loss under the Turbine Purchase 
Agreement transfers to NEPCO, but under the EPC contract SFE assumes risk of 
loss at ExTerra.  Thus NEPCO does not have a risk of loss exposure.  

I can see how NEPCO transports from Exterra to the Site under the EPC 
contract and is protected by clause 8.1 of the EPC Contract. 

 Under what authority is NEPCO transporting the equipment from the GE 
delivery point to Exterra, has Brazilian Trust engaged NEPCO to do so?  The 
Turbine Purchase Agreement does not contemplate this.

2.0  David Gohlke-  I think we have a small hole that needs and can be easily 
filled.  In the Turbine Purchase Agreement, can we have NEPCO perform 
transport service from the GE delivery point to Exterra but BT keeps ROL.

3.0 I think from a GE perspective,  the Enron family takes ROL from GE at 
Jacinto port and gets the turbines delivered to  the Site.  

4.0  Kay Mann - I really need a copy of the Ben letter- we start moving 
equipment shortly- I need to make sure that the ROL issue with GE is 
adequately covered.

John, call Pam Blande for the exact details.  It is a custom broker by the 
name of Fritz, but she will gladly give you the details.  NEPCO via a 
sub-contract moves the material out of the GE storage, to the ship, load on 
the ship, ocean shipment, unloading at Sepitiba, transport to the site, 
custom clearance, and then NEPCO unloads from the heavy hauller onto the pads.
Pam has all of the details.

Have we elected the Option to have GE deliver to the Site?

Eric,

Did you  have any comments on the turbine contract for Austin that I sent 
you?  Obviously, before we can execute a change order we have to execute a 
contract.  

Thanks,

Kay

Hi Pete,

We will want to get the CofA contract fixed up shortly.  I don't remember if 
we have addressed these issues.  I do think that GE may resist the combined 
cycle language, and I don't suggest including it.  Eric, can you still live 
with that?

Thanks,

Kay

Eric-

I revised the contract you sent me to make it site specific.  Those changes 
are redlined.  Please note that I have reinserted sections 10.4.1 and 10.4.3 
as well as the defined terms that go with them.  These were related to 
exhaust temperature and energy.  I know this is a simple cycle plant and they 
typically aren't required, but I wanted to see if GE would guarantee it 
anyway.  It maybe helpful in the future if Austin Energy goes combined 
cycle.  If for some reason GE's lawyers specifically want to leave that out, 
then they will probably also want to delete sections 10.4.2 and 10.4.4 (and 
their defined terms) since those also talk about specific exhaust 
guarantees.  Let me know what they decide.

Exhibit A (site basis conditions) which I also revised was not attached to 
your file.  (It's right behind the sign-off pages in my hard copy.)  I 
therefor hand marked up a copy and scanned it.  It is now attached as a 
separate word file. 

Exhibit F is "boiler plate" and shouldn't change.  Exhibit "U" is not in my 
hard copy.  My copy only goes up to Exhibit "T."   If you get something from 
GE on Exhibit "U", send it to me and I will be glad to review it.  

If you have questions, give me a call.  (67550)  I will be in Ausitn 
Wednesday and Thursday, but will be available by cell phone (713) 412-6873.

Thanks,
Eric Booth

Kay-

Based on the fact that we're almost done with the project, I don't have any 
comments to the S&S breakout contract for our units at Austin.  If you want 
to remove the combined cycle language, I can live with that.  What I hope we 
can keep are the Austin site specific basis conditions and performance 
guarantees (which are currently listed in the contract you sent to me).  Let 
me know if they resist.

Thanks,
Eric

Refresh my recollection.  Did we (Enron and Northwestern) agree to the form 
of the escrow agreement?  If so, then we will need to see if the escrow agent 
has any comments.  Chris is on vacation, ciaoing down in Italy (sorry, 
couldn't resist).  He should be the point man, though.

On the Delta deal we ran into some complications in moving money because 
Citibank had the money invested in a money market account.  Does the current 
draft allow for that?  I guess the easiest thing to do is to send it to me 
and let me see what's up.  

Thanks,

Kay

Kay:

I thought I would check in to determine the status of the escrow account
since it needs to be set up 30 days following the execution of the Letter
Agreement.  Let me know if I should follow up with Chris regarding the
details.

Marisa

The way we actually paid the invoices changed slightly after Chris had sent 
the letter to GE.  We deducted the LD's and the retention amount from the 
April 25th invoice (since the May invoice was not due until May 25th).

On May 8th, a wire totalling $1,671,039 was sent to GE -- this represented 
$469,000 for the c/o #2 invoice and $1,202,039 for the April 25th invoice 
less the LD's and retention.

To respond to Jeff Darst's letter, we can say that we are planning on paying 
the May 25th invoice in full (assuming we're not planning on deducting 
additional LD's for May 8-May 25).  

We just need to clarify with Jeff that both the LD and the retention were 
deducted from the April invoice, and then we can deal with resolving the 
issues he discusses in his letter.

I wish I could say that's the reason we haven't heard anything. I suspect we 
would have heard if they had a problem with it being WordPerfect.  I hope 
this doesn't mean they haven't tried to open it yet.

I have complained about EECC Contracts using WordPerfect.  As far as I know, 
it is the ONLY Enron group still using it.  EECC Legal uses Word.  I always 
figured this WordPerfect thing was intentional, which is why I had 
WordPerfect loaded on my computer.

I don't think I can make the conversion from home due to download problems.  
I will see that you get a converted copy.

Please put it on my calendar so I won't forget.   thanks ckm

Nothing better than a FREE trip to SF.  Where will you stay?

Well, just let me know so I can put it on my calendar.  You are all set with 
my vacation days on your calendar.  This SF trip is going to be fun!  We are 
going to be wined and dined by a vendor from Tidal Software.  Ric helped him

Good suggestion.  Why don't  you run it by George, and if you get positive 
feedback I'll suggest it to Ben.

Kay-I have reviewed the GE acknowledgment, and I believe it does everything
InterGen would want in that GE permits the multiple transfers all the way to
the project company (Larkspur) and GE acknowledges that the transfers will
not result in a breach of the Facility Agreements.  I have also reviewed the
unanimous consents and find them to be OK.

I propose going back to George with the proposal that simultaneously with
the execution of the unanimous consent that ENA be permitted to exercise its
puts under the two LLC, which can be done with InterGen's consent and
InterGen's receipt of an acknowledgment from GE that the exercise of the put
will not in any manner prejudice the rights under the Facility Agreements
(which in view of the transfer of the turbines and the Facility Agreements
being permitted by GE, such a request may be superfluous, but I'd like to
have it anyway).

I considered also recommending a release from ENA's obligations under the
Letter Agreements, but I think that may be pushing too far.

Let me know your thoughts.

Hi Ben,

IMHO, your team needs a basic understanding of the finance and accounting 
issues.  Legal should have a bit more of a developed (and probably current) 
understanding of how to address the issues.  Between Development and Legal, 
we should be able to get docs about 90% there.  We then take the almost 
compliant docs to Accting/Finance for fine tuning.  

A key action item is getting a presentation set up where there is a good 
download of information from Acct/Finance to the Development group.  We had 
one yesterday for Legal, and it was helpful.  I want to sit in when your 
troops get the presentation, if at all possible, because I can help translate 
on both sides, I believe.  I also want to make sure that Development and 
Legal are on the same page.  Fire drill avoidance is a key objective.

Look forward to discussing in detail.

Kay

As you all know, our group is in the middle of a very significant amount of 
development and equipment book management activity, This hard work by all of 
you has allowed us to achieve very impressive income results thus far this 
year, and has set the stage for continued success. It has also placed 
significant demands on internal resources that are integral to our success, 
in particular those resources in Global Finance, Accounting, and Legal. 

In order to ensure a proper prioritization of work flow, and that project 
specific objectives and time lines are communicated, I need each of you to 
come to me with all new agreements prior to seeking input from Accounting and 
Global Finance. I will interface with these two groups and establish 
priorities for their review.

We will continue to refine how we interface with these groups, and as such, 
I'd appreciate any suggestions you would have. I plan to have a staff meeting 
next week, and we can discuss it at that time.

Thanks,

Hi.  Happy Mother's Day.

I was kinda hoping for a post-graduation family  event on that Saturday, as 
hopes were raised when the ticket issue came up.  Doesn't sound like that's 
happening.   I don't know when we will be up that way, but it wouldn't 
surprise me if we headed up Sat am.  That's Memorial Day weekend, so traffic 
out of Houston on Friday will be horrific.  Neil and I haven't discussed any 
details yet, though.

Paige is supposed to intern with the Houston Aeros this summer.  No pay, 
which is a bad thing.  She is currently on the way to Colorado with some 
friends, and will be back a week from Sunday.  I haven't even mentioned Mac's 
graduation yet.  

I just finished a really busy time, and I'm optimistic that things will 
resume a more normal pace.  I hope to catch up on yard work this weekend, 
maybe clean out a closet.  I have the urge to purge.  

I would say the Katie got the Clarke math gene, but Paige is a math whiz.  It 
must be a recessive characteristic.  It is great that the girls have 
different arenas in which to excel.  

I sent Mom a table top cactus garden.  Hope it gets there.  

No clue on what to get Mac.  I guess I should ask Paige for ideas.  If I get 
some good ones from her or Mikey I'll let you know.

Love,

Kay

Hi! How are you guys doing?  I understand that it is getting to be time for
Paige to come back for the summer. Does she have any big plans? Is she going
to work for Enterprise again? I can't believe that it is just about summer.

The girls have a couple more weeks. Katie had her end of course Algebra test
this week and made a 100 on it. Things are looking up for her academically.
She was so pleased and proud. This will give her some high school credit for
math. Now she has a test like it for French. Tonight she is in Arlington
with her band. They are going to play in a competition tomorrow and then
spend Saturday at Six Flags.  Big times!

Annie is still pitching like a wild woman. Her league is having the end of
season tourney over the next couple of weeks and then All Stars will start
at the end of June and last for a couple of weeks.

As for Bobby and me, we just try to keep up with it all.

Mama told me that yall will be coming up for Mac's graduation. I think we
will be up there too. It looks like we are going to go up on Friday night
and spend the night on Glenmont. Then probably stay for Saturday night too.
Mama has offered to pay to put we grown-ups in a Holiday Inn on Saturday,
and the grandkids can stay with her and Daddy. I think we will take her up
on it. I know she would be happy to get you a room at the Holiday Inn or
whatever also.

I don't know what we are going to get him for graduation. We got Paige a
James Avery charm, but I just don't think that Mac would be that excited
about something like that. I think I'll get him something useful.

I guess I need to decide what to get Mother for Mothers Day.

Well, have a great weekend and a wonderful mother's day. I hope that they
spoil you rotten. Oh speaking of spoiled rotten, I hear you enjoyed your
visit to the spa. Good for you!  I know you were looking forward to going.

Take care and give my love to your family.

Another point:

How do we price gas/power we sell to them, especially in light of our duty of 
good faith and fair dealing?  

Not expecting an answer via email, this is just a topic for further 
discussion.

ckm

In an effort to get the commercial terms of the contract organized and 
papered, we discussed the following issues during yesterday's meeting:

? What will be the contracted process for setting the Bogey?
? What heat rates or heat rate ranges will go in the contract?
? Can we create a schedule to collar the Bogey given a certain gas price?
? Can we get a gas management fee for being the Fuel Manager? (this is a 
retrade)
? How does the network service transmission agreement including ancillary 
services get accounted for in the "cost" calculation?
? How does Imballance get sorted out at the end of the the month as a profit 
or a cost?

Regarding calculation of the Bogey, we have several issues.  First, what is 
the methodology?  Rick is very close to having a stack model that 
incorporates the business rules including minimum run times, startup costs, 
VOM, etc.  Second, what are the daily inputs and who is responsible for 
running the model?  This process will need to be documented every time the 
calc is performed.  Third, what is the timing of the calc?  We discussed 
getting the input info by 2am and doing the calc on a "day ahead" basis.  
Only on a select basis would the calc be re-done mid-day.

We are planning on meeting with Marvin next week and working to resolution on 
these issues.  This should result in a set of business rules that can be put 
into the contract.

Please comment/correct/add/subtract to any or all of the above.  David 
Fairley and I will be sending out the Marketing Strategy and Trading and Risk 
Policy later this morning.

Thanks,

Reagan

in 6 years so I probably need to let her go - as if I had any say!).

How about something the following week?

Hi Ben,

How's about the Acccounting/Finance presentation at noon on May 23rd, then we 
can all go to the Astros' game at 305?

I don't need Stokes & Bartholemew to serve as lobbyists - I need them to 
continue to serve as local counsel on a few projects we're continuing to work 
on. I've been using Johnny Hayes for lobbying matters.

Kay - do we need to do anything to keep Stokes on board as local counsel for 
our Haywood and Shelby projects?

Thanks,

Ben

Our lobbyists are the same.  I will call you to discuss what you are working

Thanks for the e-mail. Who is our lobbyist? I still have a need for Stokes & 
Bartholemew (Gif Thornton and Bill Bruce). Other that that, I think I'm 
covered. Please let me know the name of the lobbyist before terminating.

Thanks.

I don't know anything about Shelby, but I take it that you don't think it 
impacts Haywood at this late date.

All:

Attached for your records is a copy of the final version of the proposal 
letter that went out to NiMo last week.

Also attached below is a first set of clarification questions I receved from 
Navigant regarding our proposal.   Responses to these questions are due no 
later than Weds 5/16 and we will be working to respond to these in an 
appropriate fashion.   You will see that the questions are rather shallow and 
do not really provide any sense as to their reaction to our proposal.  I have 
left msgs with the folks at Navigant so that I may speak with them in an 
attempt to cut to the chase and discern what NiMO's true intentions are at 
this point.  I do not want to waste time answering these questions and 
marking up the proposed contracts if they ultimately will decide to take 
another course of action.   My hope is to get a mtg with NiMO ASAP and 
short-circuit the RFP process as soon as possible.

Please provide any comments on the attached questions by Monday so that we 
can decide our form of response by Wednesday.  Kay - you will note they 
requested markups of the Transacton Docs -- let's continue holding off until 
I can get a better read if it will be worth the effort.  Ed/Paul - note the 
questions on how much credit requirements we have assumed.  I don't know how 
much more clearly we can state the fact that we require a claim on ALL of 
NiMOs assets, but any appropriate elaboration on this would be appreciated.

Those bizness whites are the best.

I've requested a directory from K&S and found my Business Pages.  Dina had 
"borrowed them" while I was gone.  I'm just lost without them.  

Gentlemen,

Could we schedule some time for a conference call next week?  I would 
appreciate the opportunity to work through some of the legal issues.  I have 
the lofty goal of not working Memorial Day weekend this year, so I'm trying 
to get as much done on this deal as soon as possible.

Thanks,

Kay

PS.  I'm open Tues am and most of Wednesday.  I can probably work my schedule 
so that I'm available quite a bit of next week.

I'm travelling on Monday, so please ask my assistant, Suzanne Adams for a 
copy.

I'm new  to this particular group in Legal, so I'm still learning who does 
what.  No offense  intended.

This deal has a lot of life and potential, so I look forward to getting to 
know you in the process.

Kay-

I am sorry that I have not been able to introduce myself to you, but I was 
off getting married during the middle of July, so I have been a little out of 
the loop the last couple of weeks. 

My name is Tom Chapman and I work in Enron Government Affairs.  My primary 
responsibility is to work with and mitigate regulatory risks in North 
Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia.  So things like the NCNG gas contract 
with the City of Rocky Mount are right up that pathway.  That being said, I 
think that Allyson will handle it and is the right person to contact on this 
issue because she is our local counsel and would represent us in any lawsuit, 
but she did call me to ask me a question, and I had not even seen the note.  
This left me a little uncertain as to the context of the discussion.  I had 
an inkling, but I would have preferred foreknowledge.  That being said, would 
you include me in further transmissions so that I can stay abreast of the 
various situations surrounding the Edgecombe plant.

In addition, could you send me a copy of the agreement between the City of 
Rocky Mount and NCNG.  Thanks, I appreciate it.

Hi there,

I believe Chris should be back today, so I wanted to follow up on this.  

I don't have any recollection of where we left the escrow agreement with NW.  
Please get with MKahn or Jerry DeBerry to see if we can get consensus on the 
current form of escrow agreement.  Once we have that, Enron (Chris) will make 
contact with Citibank.  

Thanks,

Kay

Hi John,

Enron is ok with signing the consents.  After the assignment of the contracts 
out of LLCs, we would like to exercise our put.  Please share this info with 
George.  

I believe Ben will be in town tomorrow (right Ben?) so we can get it signed 
up this week.

Thanks,

Kay

How does this look?

Kay

John,

I made the changes you suggested. 

The prior version contained a non-circumvention (you can't pursue the project 
without me) versus the current exclusivity (you must work only with me), 
which seems somewhat more restrictive since it would keep us from bringing in 
additional participants.  I've changed language in the next paragraph to 
avoid a contradiction.  

 If we go with this approach then I suspect we will want to work on an LOI 
which divides up responsibility going forward. Let me know what you think. 

Kay

Are you available any time this week?  We are getting down to the nitty 
gritty.

Kay

Would you please let Suzanne know?

Thanks,

I do recall the conversations you and I had (actually a series of pages, I 
believe), so I'll check with Rebecca and see if she still has those signature 
pages.  

Kay

Kay-are you certain that Enron didn't sign it, because I recall that it was
signed (and the conversations we had about getting it signed)

Marissa,

I suppose that's because ENA didn't sign it, as I didn't notice it (opps).
It will probably be tomorrow since Ben will need to initial, as well as me.
Can you email me the sig page?

Thanks,

Kay:

This past Friday, I received six original signature pages to the Letter
Agreement, but did not receive original signature pages to the Guaranty.
Could you forward the signature pages to the Guaranty at your earliest
convenience?

Kathleen,

I have spoken with Mr. Greene's attorney - Ed Legner - and let him know that 
his minor suggested changes for the one year extension of the Pontiac site 
option were acceptable.  I indicated that we would send out originals for 
review and execution this week.

The procedure we agreed to was as follows:

We will send originals to Ed Legner in Pontiac for his review and initials.
He will forward to Dick Greene in Florida for execution.
Dick will sign and send to us
We execute and return their original along with the the two checks in the 
amount of $5000 each - one for exercise of the six month extension, and the 
other for making our requested changes for turbopark compliance and for 
granting an additional 12 month extension option at the end of this year.

I would like to get this inked as soon as possible in order to ensure the 
viability of the Pontiac site for a 2003 COD.

Carolyn,

GE is calling for the original turbine contract.  I believe I previously 
provided Lee Johnson's address.  Could you send him an original?

Thanks,

Kay

I've tried sending this 3 times.  Please see if you can figure out the 
problem.  I've used the autoaddressing and his long internet address.  If all 
else fails, just print and have it delivered, I guess, or send it to his 
assistant.

price we sell to them may not be the same price we bought from a third party, 
depending on market conditions. Something like that.

05/11/2001 03:41 PM
I think that this will continue to be a very sticky issue for us on all 
services deals and I think the following is the way to handle it.

We build into all of these contracts that the counterparty may at any time, 
chose to transact directly with a third counterparty.  We would still 
administer the contracts and perform the scheduling etc. for them if they 
chose to do this.  In this way, the customer may always chose to deal 
directly if they chose and we would be doing the scheduling.  I believe that 
this will serve to counteract concerns that we will not provide them fair 
market prices since they could always chose to deal directly.  We are 
confident that our prices are will be competitive and that the counterparty 
will chose to transact through us.  We would of course need to protect our 
share of the benefit in the case they transact with someone else.

Tom.

Another point:

How do we price gas/power we sell to them, especially in light of our duty of 
good faith and fair dealing?  

Not expecting an answer via email, this is just a topic for further 
discussion.

ckm

In an effort to get the commercial terms of the contract organized and 
papered, we discussed the following issues during yesterday's meeting:

? What will be the contracted process for setting the Bogey?
? What heat rates or heat rate ranges will go in the contract?
? Can we create a schedule to collar the Bogey given a certain gas price?
? Can we get a gas management fee for being the Fuel Manager? (this is a 
retrade)
? How does the network service transmission agreement including ancillary 
services get accounted for in the "cost" calculation?
? How does Imballance get sorted out at the end of the the month as a profit 
or a cost?

Regarding calculation of the Bogey, we have several issues.  First, what is 
the methodology?  Rick is very close to having a stack model that 
incorporates the business rules including minimum run times, startup costs, 
VOM, etc.  Second, what are the daily inputs and who is responsible for 
running the model?  This process will need to be documented every time the 
calc is performed.  Third, what is the timing of the calc?  We discussed 
getting the input info by 2am and doing the calc on a "day ahead" basis.  
Only on a select basis would the calc be re-done mid-day.

We are planning on meeting with Marvin next week and working to resolution on 
these issues.  This should result in a set of business rules that can be put 
into the contract.

Please comment/correct/add/subtract to any or all of the above.  David 
Fairley and I will be sending out the Marketing Strategy and Trading and Risk 
Policy later this morning.

Thanks,

Nothing fatal. Here are some thoughts/comments on the AMA for your general 
consideration:

2.2 (d) Bank accounts/bookkeeping.  I've previously been advised that Corp 
performs this function.    Issues which arise: will the money be invested 
overnight, who has signature authority, etc.  We have a draft services 
agreement prepared for Peoples which can serve as a "go by" if you decide you 
need a separate doc.

2.2 (b)Billing/collection.  Responsibility generally should stop at sending 
nastygrams.  No duty to hire lawyers, etc.

2.2 (f) Insurance.  In Texas, you have to have licenses to buy/sell insurance 
and adjust claims.  Current language may be soft enough to not violate 
licensing laws.

2.2 (g) cost of filing for licenses and permits not included in defn of 
Marketing Expenses, but there's some catch all language that might help.

2.3  Accountants may like it to be clear that we can't hire/fire O & M 
contractor, set O & M policies, or dispatch plant.

3.2   If there are multiple transactions in a short period, these may be 
captured in one document, not one document for each transaction.

 It would be helpful if the EEIM for use with others explains our agency 
role. (may be in there - didn't review a copy) Is the Owner a power marketer 
yet?  Are we helping them get EEIM's with the Approved Counterparties, or are 
they on their own?

 Will Enron sign on behalf of Owner for Contractor (Enron) transactions 
(sounds silly)?  Is there an EEIM in the works between EPMI and Owner?  

3.3 (f) I suspect by now you've figured out profits, etc, relating to "day 
of" transactions.  

3.4  last line - should it be interruptible instead of contingent?  Assume 
Owner has transmission risk?

Is there a "no third party beneficiary" clause?  I might have missed it.  Not 
life or death.

Interesting structure.  Could I get a copy of the final document?

Thanks,

Kay

Me too.  It is my filing system.

I still haven't gotten it back, so he must have received it.  I dread Outlook 
because I keep so much information on my email!

Carolyn,

Your approach makes perfect sense to me, but I think Lee wants his turbine=

contract sooner.

I still haven't received the finance stuff yet.  I've asked again today.

Kay

Kay:

I have Lee Johnson's address information and will send the Turbine Contract
now.  (I had been holding this package waiting on signature pages from
Freshfields on all of the other GE documents that GE provided directly to
Freshfields, as I was going to include these documents in the GE package as
well).  =20

GE is calling for the original turbine contract.  I believe I previously

Hi Ben,

I've been working on the letter, but I've got to fill in a bunch of blanks 
before it is finished (proper names, etc.)  Depends on how complete you want 
it to be.

I've got to check to see if this is the final version we agreed to.  It is 
very close.

I'd like to call Jeff Darst today to discuss the letter he sent on LDs, etc. 
Prior to calling him, though, I wanted to e-mail the acknowledgement letter 
and the acknowledgement and consent. I was wondering if you could provide me 
an electronic copy of the acknowledgement and consent, and a draft letter. 
Let me know when you think you can get to this, and I'll schedule the call 
with Darst accordingly.

Thanks,

Ben

Here's the version NorthWestern approved.

Letter to follow...

Kay

In addition, we can add language that says we are specifically not prohibited 
from.......  and list what we care about.

Kay

Hi Rebecca,

I'm trying to locate the sig pages for the NW guaranty.  These were the docs 
that I approved after I had approved the letter agreement.  These signed 
pages weren't with the letter agreements and change orders you brought me.  
To you remember if you brought them to me before?  I haven't really searched 
- I thought I would ask first.

Thanks,

Kay  

Is this what you were thinking about?

Tam Pham, ma'am.  Thanks for the clue!

Hi Stacy,

I don't know if Jeff or Debra mentioned this to you, but this is a master we 
need in place in connection with a gas/power asset management arrangement 
with the cities of Yazoo City and Clarksdale Mississippi.  As you can see, 
Jeff suggested you take a look at it before it is sent to the customer.

Thanks,

Hi again,

I checked my maps of DC, and it looks like the Hotel Washington might be a 
good alternative.  Could you see what they have for Mon/Tues night?  Also, 
please check back with the Willard to see if they have had any cancellations.

Could you email me your telephone number and the afterhours number?

Due to the shortage of time, please call me with any information you might 
have.  I should be in my office from 830 until 930.  Ex 57566  If I'm not 
there, I'll be checking messages.

I figured it would.  The master is now in the hands (or on the email) of 
Stacy Dickson, one of the gas lawyers.  Let's see if we hear anything by noon.

Kay

ps.  You might warn Bob P. that this is coming, and needs top attention.  We 
can send it to his lawyer at the same time, if he wants.  I think it is 
someone other than David, though.  Can you find out who he wants to receive 
the draft?

Thanks,

Kay

fyi.  Stacy just got the draft this am.

Gotta love the passion.

We need the Master Gas Agreement between Yazoo and ENA executed ASAP !!
In the last meeting, it was stated that for Clarksdale we would have the 
third party supplier invoice
the Cities directly, however once the Yazoo rehab work was completed, ENA 
would be supplying and
invoicing Yazoo.  Yazoo is near completion on the work, and has already 
burned gas in their testing over
the past weekend. I currently have an imbalance with the pipe which  I need 
to repay ASAP.  Also once the 
Yazoo unit is completed, I have NO MECHANISM to deliver the gas until we 
execute the Master Gas as
was discussed two weeks ago.

Can we swap days with Charlotte and go tomorrow? We need her to pick up 
Michael if we are going to go together.

Sharon's phone number is 713-780-4459. She offered the following times to

It is worth a try, but it would be unusually generous of the power systems 
group to go along without push back.  At least now we will see where we stand.

Did Herman leave you a voice mail telling you that getting GE to sign off 
like this wouldn't do the trick? I'm guessing you've decided to appeal.

John,

I noticed a different file name on this draft than the version Pete Thompson 
sent out.  How is this version different from Pete's?  I sure hate to have 
more than one version of this monster being vetted at the same time.

Thanks,

Wilson,

You should get a call from Suzanne, my assistant.  We're trying to set things 
up for Thursday am.  How does that look?

Kay

Kay,

Sorry to be so slow in getting back to you. I'm generally available for the 
rest of the week. I have several lunch meetings, but my schedule is free 
otherwise.

Due to the size of this possible transaction, I thought I would keep you in 
the loop on its status.

We submitted a bid with caveats as to its non-binding nature, and suggested 
an alternative structure.  In response, Navigant issued questions. John 
Llodra has compiled answers, which appear to be fine to me.

 We  (Legal) have been instructed to standby, awaiting commercial guidance as 
to whether we will be going forward.  I believe Klauberg has either cleared 
conflicts or initiated the process, so if we go forward, he should be our man.

I will let you know once a go/no go decision is reached.

Herman Manis will need the opportunity to review, also.

Feel free to copy all you want, assuming there is nothing too compromising!

Hi Kay!

How are yall doing? We are doing okay. Katie had to be at her school at 8
for a band thing and you would think it was the darkest day of the year.
But, I think secretly she was looking forward to seeing her friends. Since
she's in 8th grade, she's feeling pretty big.

I accidentally brought home a roll of Paige's film. I think it's Paiges, it
has a picture of Mikey on it. But it could be yours. Anyway, there were a
couple of really cute pictures of your kids and mom and dad, so if it's okay
with you I would like to get some copies made for me to keep before I mail
the roll to you. Is that okay?

There are a couple of really cute picures of Paige carrying Michael piggy
back!

Take it easy!

Love you!

Lisa

Opps.  I didn't notice C Sherman's name.  I'm unclear as to whether Herman 
needs it also.

Hi Matt,

contract.  Just thought you should know that it will be a E-Next type doc.

Thanks,

Hi there.

I am attaching for the group's consideration a red line that I ran comparing 
the current working draft (v4) with the draft John R. recently circulated to 
Tax and Insurance. 

I suggest that Pete Thompson keep the typewriter on this.  We are getting so 
close to the end, I would really like to try to avoid confusion.  

I am also attaching a clean copy of the current active version, and the 
current list of issues under consideration.  I suggest we work through this 
list and turn another draft before soliciting Cris/Herman and Lisa's 
comments.  We should also give the ENA commercial reps the opportunity to 
review it at that time.

Kay

Please prepare Sheila and I notebooks with the following emails and 
attachments printed (all located in my GE General email folder):

Sheila and I discussed using the time at 130 CDT for an internal discussion, 
bringing her up-to-speed on the issues and discussing action items.  Nothing 
set in concrete, though.

Kay

I have Michael's name pinned on my bulletin board at work, so he is in my 
thoughts and prayers daily.  Good luck!  Kay

Bob.Joyce@kvaerner.com on 05/15/2001 12:56:02 PM
Michael was admitted to MD Anderson late last night for the start of chemo
(4 days of it), followed by the bone marrow transplant next Monday.  He's in
isolation (for his own protection), and - so far - seems to be doing OK.
What a way to spend one's 25th birthday (tomorrow)!  Well, he probably is
taking it in stride as he's spent a Christmas and New Year's in the hospital
already.

If you've been praying for him, keep it up.  And thank you.  And if you
haven't started, now would be a great time to begin.

Bob

PS There was news last week about the FDA approving a new drug for leukemia
treatment.  Unfortunately, it's for a different kind of leukemia than what
Michael has.

I have 30 minutes at 930 (1000am meeting)

Would you all be in a posiotion to get together tomorrow morning at 9:30 am 
Houston time to review the issues list and  talk about how we get to the end 
of this process with GE.  We immediately need to start the drafting of the 
Longview turbine contract and I'd like to see if we are close enough to get 
that started.  Scott, today the extension to the Agreement in Principle 
expires and we need to extend.  Can you tee this up with Steve Swift?  Our 
meeting tomorrow will be in lieu of the regularly scheduled GE call.  I'll 
let them know we will call them later this week or we'll talk next Wednesday, 
but I would like to get through whatever we need to in order to get the 
Longview Turbine Contract going.  
I've talked to John Schwartzenburg about this and he is available tomorrow 
morning.

I think we need an internal review to develop responses to positions as 
outlined in PT's memo. 

Kay

My prior email was written before I read this and it seems like everyone is 
geared up for the call with GE tomorrow.  I'm OK with proceeding if everyone 
thinks we can resolve some stuff.

  I took several assignments from the last World Hunger call.  Status as 
follows:

a.   Tax language-  I have sent a prior version of Rev 4 jr to Matt G asking 
him to call me to let me know when he can talk with GE tax rep.  Steve Swifit 
and I are in London and would like to sit in on that call.

b.   Insurance Language review.   I sent same version to David Marshall and 
Paul Parrish asking for their reviews and opinion as to whether 7FA's are new 
technology.

c.   I "volunteered" to look at the termination language in world hunger, GE 
had some problems, and I had the same problem with the ARCOs contract.   I 
drafted a fix last Friday, sent to Kay M for comment.  I have included my 
suggested changes in the attached redline.  I have forwarded same fix to GE 
at end Friday for Arcos.    I have asked Kay if she still has a concern with 
the Limit of Liability as it relates to termination.  I think it works.

d.  I "volunteered" to work over Article 10, Exhibit B-3 and Exhibit B-6 in 
relation to Guarantees and liquidated damages.  I have done that in the 
attached redline of the T&C and Exhibits.

e. Some time ago I volunteered to resurrect the language associated with the 
reduction in the LD refund in Section 10.9.8.   I had sent out a couple weeks 
ago but received no reaction.    I have entered that fix in the attached 
redline.

f.  I have made several minor changes to definitions associated with 
performance.

Attached is Rev4-JR version of GE T&C's and Exhibits for world hunger.  They 
start from the clean rev 4 version of the T&Cs that Peter forwarded to me at 
my request.  The attached are redlined to show my changes.

I have not sent any of this to GE except for the termination language fix.   
I suggest that the Enron team give these a quick read before the World hunger 
call.  I can print same here and share with GE during the call unless there 
is an objection.  

I hope this will help to advance the process.  My earlier emails to Paul and 
Matt were not intended confuse the situation with different drafts.  Please 
ignore those and for the above purposes use the attached files.

Kay- I suggest that you forward to others who you feel appropriate for the 
purposes of the world hunger call on Wednesday.

Hi there,

We need the exact name of the YC entity which will be buying the gas.  Is it 
Yazoo City or the YCPC, or what?  Same info is required for Clarksdale, 
although not as urgently.

If you will email me the addresses of all who need to review this, the YC 
contract will be ready tomorrow.

Thanks,

Kay

Absolutely.  

Good point!  Can Peter start to draft an override letter?

	Kay Mann@ENRON

As a reminder to all of us, we will need a form override letter to go with 
the form turbine contract.  

Kay

I took a crack at tightening up the E Next assignment language as it exists 
in the overrides, for inclusion in WH form:

Peter, could you take first cut at the override letter?  We  may be having an 
internal meeting at 930 central, and if so, will you be available by phone if 
necessary?

Suz, please put the attachment in the notebook.

Thanks,

Kay

I have a conflict at 130. Rose has been reliable at showing up and 
participating, so I suggest that she be included, although it sounds like she 
'll be with John.

Yes. Let's do 1:30 for an internal call.  I'll get Suzanne to send out the 
dial-in instructions.  Let's make sure that the GE guys know NOT to call in.  
Thanks!.  I know that John Schwartzenburg will be late since he is

Read your notes re scheduling a call w/ or w/o GE.  From John's and my 
perspective, it seems that we should first have an internal call re the 
consolidation of our assignments from weeks past  into Peter's draft contract 
and then send to GE for their review and follow up call either later this 
week or next.  Steve Swift is OK with this approach.  

At the moment we seem to be knee deep w/GE and Owner on Arcos and suspect 
that 9:30 CST (3:30 London time) will be difficult for us to call in.  
Instead, 1:30 CST would work better for us.  

If this works for the Houston gang could you let us know soonest and we will 
let Mike and Steve know as well.

Kay and Brian,

In reply to Tim Lederach's e-mail below to Jeff Smith on June 6th, I have the 
following comments:

1.  Regarding Tim's addition of the second and third sentences to my original 
suggested language, it appears that there may be a misunderstanding.  Under 
Mexican tax law, EEIM would be obligated to withhold tax on any payments it 
makes to GE that are subject to Mexican withholding tax.  EEIM would submit 
such amounts directly to the Mexican tax authorities and, in exchange, would 
receive an official receipt (Official Form 37-A) that it could then forward 
to GE.  It appears that Tim wants to ensure that GE obtains a copy of the 
official receipt so that GE can claim a foreign tax credit on its U.S. income 
tax return for any withholding tax to which payments it receives are subject 
under Mexican tax law.  Tim's suggested additional language therefore needs 
to modified to reflect that EEIM would pay the tax and could then provide GE 
with the receipt.  I'd be glad to visit with Tim to discuss this matter.

2.  The language that I have proposed should be inserted in both the onshore 
agreement and the offshore agreement.  Tim is proposing that it be inserted 
(with his additional suggestions) only in the onshore agreement.

Please contact me at ext. 35777 if you have any questions.

Best regards,

Jeff

Kay,
See the proposed wording, below.  This is the only contract text issue I am
aware of.
Other than the items mentioned in my e-mail of June 1st/2nd (on the
consolidation agreement) and finalization of the "letter agreement" (you got
my fax), we are there.
Implied in the above, is that at this point I think the split agreement
approach would get us to closure faster.
Regards,
Jeff Smith

I have no problem with their proposed addition as it applies to the onshore
contract.  However, I would recommend modifying it as follows:

      If Purchaser is obligated to make any payment to Seller that
is subject to any withholding tax, then Purchaser shall remit the
appropriate withholding tax to the proper governmental authorities, and
Purchaser shall then remit the net amount of the payment (i.e., the gross
payment minus the applicable withholding tax) to Seller.  Seller agrees to
provide Purchaser with an original tax receipt, in Seller's name, indicating
remittance by the Purchaser of the amounts withheld.  Failure to provide
this receipt within a reasonable period of time will result in the amount
withheld becoming payable to the Seller.
Regards

Hi Kara,

Michael has been seeing a speech/language therapist, and recently she raised 
an issue about Michael's ability to "blend and unblend" sounds in words, 
specifically as it relates to reading readiness.  She had this conversation 
with Neil, so I don't know the details.  We are meeting with her today to get 
more input, but I wanted to mention it to you, just in case you had a comment.

I know this is something we can discuss at Michael's conference on May 31st, 
but if you would like to discuss it before hand, I can be reached at 713 304 
8716 9 (cell), 713 345 -7566 (office - just tell my asst you are Michael's 
teacher), 713 973 6325.

Thanks so much,

Kay

Here are my comments after reviewing the below change order: (i) the cover 
page refers to an enron 2-99 deal which does not correspond to the cover page 
of the executed turbine purchase contract with GE.  To what does this refer 
if a different deal and if the same deal, please conform.  (ii) the effective 
date is stated as March 6, 2000.  Given that the agreement between Enron and 
WestLB and the purchase agreement between WestLB and GE weren't signed until 
May 12, 2000, if any backdating is needed (I'd like to understand why it is 
for new equipment orders), it can't be before May 12th.  With respect to the 
effective date and the overall placement of the order, has this $4.65MM 
acquisition been dashed?  The current effective dash only contemplated the 
turbines, not any ancillary equipment.  I believe Chip Schneider is the RAC 
contact for this transaction.

Are you here?  I wanted to get those Intergen consents done and out of the 
way.  Also, DDuran needs to sign the Northwestern guaranty (Oz signed but 
they want more copies), and I thought it would be best if you initialled.

Sorry to miss your birthday. Did you have one in my honor?  You know I really 
did have one for you on vacation.

Points well taken - some we have already addressed, others probably need to 
be tied up better.

See you soon.

By the way, it hailed in DC today. Looked good from the bar at the Willard.

Hi KC,

It would be a big help if you could take the NorthWestern guaranty sig pages

Fairley loves Bill Bryant.  However, Bill have given us some bad advice re:  
Florida siting act.  Marchris has the authority to hire who he wants to on 
regulatory side, but I wouldn't touch him for deal counsel.

I have not sought approval for retaining Bill Bryant on this project.  Who 
has done so and does he or his firm have any experience with the Seminoles or 
on Indian law matters?  I know that we also use Greenberg Trauig in Florida, 
but they represent the Seminoles so they would have a conflict in 
representing us.  Also, we do we stand on the negotiations concerning the 
letter of intent.

      Attached is a blackline of the City of Austin Turbine Agreement
   showing changes made to the version that went to GE on February 12.
This
   draft includes both Lee's and Eric's changes to Exhibit A, as well as
   the addition of the contacts for notices in Sections 25.1 and 25.3.
It
   also contains a few minor clean-up items identified by Lisa Bills
when
   she reviewed LV Cogen (e.g., the definitions of Performance Test
   Certificate and Performance Test Completion Certificate were out of
   order).  To complete the agreement, we will need to include the date
of
   execution and Exhibit H-2.  I particularly wanted Eric to review this
   before it went to the other side.  If it looks acceptable, I would be
   happy to send a copy to GE.

By the way, Bryant's bill should go to Marchris, not you.  Marchris will know 
that.

Did Steve S ask that it be added to the list?  I would let them bring it up 
if he didn't.  We spent quite a bit of time and effort on the LOL clause, and 
it was subject to lots of give and take.

GE has informed us during the Arcos discussion that GE senior management has 
directed that the GE deal team cannot agree to allowing GE indemnity 
obligations related with government fines for failure to comply with law to 
be exclude from the limit of liability.  

This needs to be added to Pete T's World Hunger Punchlist of issues.

Enron Arcos deal team has not agreed to GE's position.

Doug,

Here's the revised CA.  I highlighted the changed terms.  In addition, I 
deleted the prior paragraph 11 which said that the agreement supercedes a 
prior CA.

I don't know if the InterGen indentity and signatory are the same,  but 
obviously I left that for you to determine.  I expect that the Enron entity 
which will bid will be EPMI, so I used that entity.  

I beefed up the definition of confidential information due to the complexity 
of the issues, and I added 6 months to  the term since things won't get 
cranked up for a while.

I look forward to talking to you at your convenience.  Have a good weekend.

My comments are as follows, and I'd like you to send a letter rather than an 
e-mail:

Dear Jeff,

As a follow up  to your letter dated May 9, 2001, upon the posting of an LC 
in the amount of $965,855 representing 5% of the price of unit 1, we are 
prepared to pay GE the $1,501,885 deducted from our last payment. With 
respect to liquidated damages on delivery of the air filter, we reserve our 
rights under the contract to exercise our offset rights at a later date.

Please let me know when you will be able to have the LC in place, and we will 
make appropriate payment arrangements.

Regards,

Chris Booth
Manager

   

Kay and Ben,

I would like to send the following to Jeff Darst at GE via e-mail.

Dear Jeff,

Pursuant to you letter dated May 9, 2001 we are prepared to pay the deduct 
for liquidated damages ($536,000) and retention deduct ($965,885) withheld 
from the April 25, 2001 invoice.  Payment of the deduct for the liquidated 
damages claim does not constitute a withdrawal of the claim, hence, we are 
not waiving our rights afforded under the contract.  As stated in our letter 
dated May 3, 2001, we are prepared to pay the final 5% payment for Unit 1 
upon receipt of the Letter of Credit for $965,855 (5% of the price for Unit 
1) and a lien release.

I have revised the option form consistent (except where noted) with comments 
sent by Herman and Lisa, and have attached a redline version.  Herman, I 
dealt with your comment regarding the defn of Optionee by tinkering a little 
with the 1st paragraph.  I also construed your comment regarding Enron's 
right to terminate the option to NOT preclude termination if our counterparty 
is in default.  Please confirm that this is acceptable.

CANCELLED.

This is so sad.  But then again, God works in very mysterious ways.  If 
things are going to fall apart soon anyway....

Jim and his family have been in my prayers.  This must be very hard.

Here's a rough cut.  Let me know what you think.

The fuel cells will be subjected to testing after installation to ensure that 
each fuel cell meets the performance criteria prior to CRRA accepting the 
units.  These tests will measure heat rate, electrical output, air emissions, 
noise levels and water consumption, and will last at least one hour each.  In 
addition, a seventy-two hour test will be run to ascertain that each unit is 
capable of producing the required output without outages. The final test 
protocol will establish the number of tests to be performed.

Heather:  There was a proposed ASME standard relating to the testing of fuel 
cells, but I don't know if it has been adopted yet.  If it has been, we could 
make reference to that fact that the tests will be conducted in conformance 
with ASME PT-50, or whatever it is.  I'm sure Ric knows.

Hi Stuart,

I believe the plant manager was going to call someone at SW, to keep the 
communication lines open.  I'll be glad to draft a friendly letter to follow 
up.

Kay,

I am not sure what we decided on Friday.  Are we going to send another (more 
friendly) letter to the Westinghouse people evidencing a willingness to 
discuss the draw issue?  Please let me know at your convenience.

Reagan,

I've requested the issuance of a draft master (gas) for Clarksdale.  Yazoo 
has theirs in hand, but I haven't heard any of any comments.

The power side is a bit more complicated.  Yazoo City and Clarksdale have not 
cut a deal between them to determine how to buy power - whether it should be 
bought  by MDEA (easier in some accounting respects, but credit is more of an 
issue) or by the individual Cities.  

Maybe this should be on the list for our 300 meeting.

Kay

Thanks.  

I'll discuss with Carlos.

Ann Elizabeth,

Attached is a form of interconnect agreement that was sent to Christi Nicolay 
of government affairs for her review from a regulatory perspective.  She 
forwarded it to me for legal review, but am I forwarding it to you since it 
is connection with one of your projects.  In addition, Herman Manis of 
accounting and Lisa Bills and Rose Engeldorf of finance need to review these 
agreements from their acocunting and finance perpsectives.  I am currently in 
the process of reviewing other forms of interconnect agreements with them and 
will share with you what I learn from my meetings with them.  As of now, I 
can say generally that the issues that they tend to modify are: (1) making 
the interconnect agreement subject to a notice to proceed requirement which 
we control the issuance of; (2) not having a parent or letter of credit 
guaranty; (3) broad assignment language; and (4) limited indemnification 
obligations.

The agreement they sent was a generic and they are working on a specific 
agreement for Midway.  If you see significant issues in the generic, perhaps 
we should not wait until we get the specific agreement but start pushing to 
negotiate the known issues now.  We have a meeting with the FPL planning 
group on the 17th but on Monday I'll call and see who we will be negotiating 
the agreement with.

Greg Krause
05/07/2001 02:01 PM
I'm not sure. We are trying to copress the 
engineering/procurement/construction schedule by getting them to start work 
while we negotiate this agreement.  
Perhaps if you could review and give us general comments this week.  By then 
we may be in a better position to tell you when we would need a draft turned.

Does this work for you?

Ben, 

I'll take a look at it today, you night owl.  Hope the kids cut you some 
slack after your late night.  

You're missing our last week of nice weather for the season.  It was 65 
degress this am.  I'm taking Herman to the game tonight, which will be 
wonderful in this weather.  Next comes 90 degrees.

Michael had his first soccer practice yesterday - actually a skills 
assessment to put them on teams.  He loved it. His big sister and her 
boyfriend took  him to buy soccer clothes afterwards.  He is wearing his shin 
guards and soccer shorts to school today.  Too cute.

Hope you are enjoying your little ones.

Kay

  

Hi David,

Either email or handwritten works for me.  I would just as soon have 
everything now, if it is possible to get it to me in the today or tomorrow.

In discussing the extension yesterday, the consensus was that we should 
extend until June 29th.  If the deal gets done sooner, we can always have the 
new doc supercede the old one.  I'm copying Heather and Reagan so that they 
can  let me know if I've got it wrong.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay -- Just some housekeeping questions:

Do you want hand-written or e-mail comments going forward?

Do you want more comments from Origination and Services now, or do you want 
us to wait until you turn the doc?  As I said yesterday, I am in the process 
of sorting out the "Costs" definition so that it works better with the other 
parts of the doc.  

MDEA is willing to extend the ILA two weeks if we want to.  Their next Board 
meeting (after tonight's Board meeting) is June 12 , and they desperately 
need to have our contract finished in time to get signing approval at that 
meeting.  We probably need something to bridge us from the end of May until 
their Board votes on the full agreement.  The other option is to get done 
this week and have them call a special Board meeting.  They have done this in 
the past, but we have not asked them if it's logistically possible to do this 
by May 31.

Thanks -- David

One point you were checking was the CA.  Any luck?

Here's a free look at someone else's deal.  I don't know what role Enron has 
in the deal after sell down.

Kay
Here is a copy of the agreement, made all the more ugly by my redaction 
"surgery."

I have put some terms that you will want to think through carefully in 
italics.  I totally removed some other provisions that were particularly 
deal-specific (e.g. an obligation to offer to sell them the project if we 
decided to abandon it--I know, it's damn weird, but they were hung up on some 
strange things).

Let me know if I can answer any questions.

Thanks!

Anything posted on DealBench?

Lisa,

I haven't gotten the executed docs back, but I'll send you the electronic 
version if that works for you.

Timing is as follows:

Northwestern gives 30 days notice of readiness to close.  If the closing does 
not occur before July 16, they make another $5m payment.

10 days after notice, they fund the balance into escrow, and we close 20 days 
later.  

If they fail to close on or before Sept 1, they forfeit their previous 
payments, unless we have failed to provide the GE consent to assignment, 
which we are working on now.

I've given this timeline without looking at the doc, so I will let you know 
if I missed something.

Hopes this helps.

Kay

Please provide an update as to the status of the execution of the PSA with 
Northwestern for the forward purchase of two turbines.  It has been some time 
since I saw any documents or was involved in any meetings on this 
transaction.  If executed, please insure that we have a copy for our files 
and a tickler of what the action plan is with respect to having the documents 
for purchase from E-next prepared and timing of execution/purchase.

I agree that we need a "standard" way of moving the turbines (and 
transformers) into other structures.  Both the GE contract for the LM 6000's 
and the ABB transformer contract envision such moves.  In addition, the ADA's 
with WestLB anticipate these moves.  I'm sure you've heard plenty about all 
of this.  

I've been working on developing on some of the forms required to take some of 
this - Global Finance will coordinate other aspects of it.  I believe we are 
in pretty good shape conceptually to take care of all of it, but we should 
plan 2 to 4 weeks to get the documents completed.

I don't see any problem with this - I just wanted you to be aware of some of 
the logistics.  I'll be in the office tomorrow if you would like to discuss 
this.

Kay

Karen E Carter
08/08/2000 01:53 PM
It would appear that a number of people have been asked to look into the 
process of purchasing and transferring the four Austin turbines from the West 
LB facility.  As a number of issues need to be addressed and resolved prior 
to being able to execute this transfer, it has been suggested that a general 
meeting be set up to discuss and outline these issues.  Additionally, it 
might be appropriate to appoint one individual to spearhead this general 
effort to avoid duplicating efforts in the future.

Please indicate whether tomorrow at 3PM would fit your schedule, or suggest 
an alternate time/date.  As it is seemingly difficult to schedule a 
conference room on the 29th floor without ample advance notice, your response 
would be very helpful.  Thanks.

Hi John,

I believe Ben Jacoby has mentioned our deal with NorthWestern.  In connection 
with that transaction, we have prepared the attached assignment and consent, 
which is patterned after the Pastoria form. We would like to get it wrapped 
up in the next two weeks, if possible.

Please let Ben or me know if you have any questions.

I know a couple of their lawyers from a prior transaction (Doug Turner and 
their GC, whose name I've now forgotten).  Don't know who they will have on

Here is an overview of what projects are active:

1.  Midway - Greg Krause

The hot item is a Property Owners Association Agreement that will be entered 
into between Midway Development Company, L.L.C. ("MDC") and Cooney-Midway 
Groves (the owner of the property on which MDC has an option to purchase).  
The agreement will not be entered into or effective until MDC has given 
notice it will proceed with the project (and, thus, we control the trigger).  
I have asked Chris Boehler at A&K to turn a redline draft that incorporates 
changes that Greg and I discussed last week with he and Darren Inoff.   David 
Layman at Greenburg Traurig (our Florida counsel) also needs to incorporate 
some changes now that the platting has been done.  Chris is to send his 
redline to Greg, David and you.  David is to make his additions and then send 
a composite to Greg, you and Chris.  This will probably take a week or so and 
then it can go to the counterparty when everyone on our side is in agreement 
with the changes.  The biggest issue we have right now is that Cooney-Midway 
Groves wants to maintain control over the property as long as they own an 
interest in one of the tracts and we are not willing to allow that when we 
will own 2/3 of the property but have less than 1/2 of the vote.  This is 
because the agreement is designed to give one vote to each acre.  There are 
three tracts, of which CM will own one and MDC will own 2, but the 3rd tract 
is not alloted any votes since it must remain undeveloped land for a 
retention pond.

Chris is also working on some title commitment letters for the option we just 
secured from Clyde Thompson and Paul Freeman.  There's no rush on those and 
can definitely wait until I get back.

2.  Pompano - Steve Krimsky

Pompano has 2 issues that are hot.

1.  The infamous Developer's Agreement.  Debbie has turned another draft and 
has asked that we bless it before Thursday so that she can go visit with the 
city attorney on Friday.  The hearing in Pompano is scheduled for the evening 
of June 12 and you have indicated that you will attend.  I'll send them a 
note to tell them you'll be there.  We need to have a deal worked out with 
the Pompano commissioners before the public meeting.  The thing to keep in 
mind here is that in Pompano, unlike Deerfield, the same group that will be 
approving our request for a zoning change is the same group we have to 
negotiate the developer's agreement with.  Allegedly, they will settle for 
$1.5 MM in annual payments.  I've laid a copy of the agreement Debbie has 
prepared on your chair.

2.  In an effort to block the power plant project, Broward County has drafted 
a proposed ordinance that will place a moratorium on the approval of any 
power plant air permits until the matter can be studied at length.  The 
problem is, they expressly do not have the power to have any say in the air 
permit process.  That is expressly delegated to the Dept. of Environmental 
Protection ("DEP").    However, the DEP hasn't taken the clean approach and 
said they have NO authority but it has stated that BC is entitled to 
reasonable rules and regulations and DEP will let them have some permit 
approvals; HOWEVER, air permits for power plants are expressly not delegated 
to BC.   Greenburg is probably a week away from being able to give us a legal 
opinion on the likelihood that Broward County will be able to do something 
that is legally defensible.  Once they started looking into this, it became 
quite the legal search because at one time BC did have the authority to pass 
special acts. However, in 1977 their special act authority was cut off but 
the legislature ratified all rules they had in effect at that time.  After 
that, they were granted charter power to adopt have such authority as a 
charter county to adopt their own home rules as long as they were not 
inconsistent with state or federal law or the constitution.  In 2000, they 
repealed all prior acts relating to the issuance of air permits and said they 
would rely on their charter power to make up their own rules.  Problem is, 
the DEP has expressly not given them the right to have a say in air permits 
for power plants.  Needless to say, this is sticky and icky.  My 
recommendation is that we don't jump out and incur litigation costs.  Let us 
get a memo together, go talk to the county attorney and show him that they 
don't have the right to do this.  The hearing on adopting this ordinance is 2 
p.m. on June 12, same day as the commissioner's meeting on the Developers 
Agreement.  Between now and June 12, Debbie Orshefsky would like to talk to 
the attorney and to the DEP.  Indications are that the DEP will strongly 
support us as this could be a turf battle for them.  The county attorney may 
come to his senses and advise the commission that passing such an ordinance 
will be costly as it is unenforceable if challenged.  We can also ask the DEP 
to issue a "declaratory statement" and it is likely that statement would say 
that state law is pre-emptive and the ordinance is invalid.

This is a very, very broad brush of what is a very legislative history 
intensive issue.  Debbie will be looking to you to read the memo that will 
come next week and agree on a strategy on going forward.

3.  Deerfield - Steve Krimsky

Unlike Pompano where the commissioners who vote on the rezoning are the same 
who vote on the developer's agreement, in Deerfield they don't have a say 
over any of the approval process.  However, to facilitate coming into the 
city, they expect something.  If we can agree on the form of developer's 
agreement, then it would be substantially used in the same manner in 
Deerfield.  In Deerfield, they have said they want 3 things:  a payment in 
lieu of taxes, a landscape fund to fund upkeep of a particular street (which 
is basically an adopt a street program and is required of any new business 
coming into Deerfield) and they want an easement to put a cellular tower on 
our property.  I've told Steve Krimsky the latter can be a headache because 
if they are successful in leasing the space on the tower to third parties, 
that creates a lot of traffic going across your property.  It is very 
do-able, we just need to structure it correctly. I've done several radio 
tower agreements and we can use those as go-bys.  They may also want a "fire 
service fee" if we give one to Pompano.  There's also lots and lots of 
negative publicity on a daily basis and Eric Thode is wanting to respond with 
an editorial in the Sun-Sentinel.  I'll forward the most recent version they 
have been sharing amongst themselves and not we lawyers.  The hearing in 
Deerfield is June 8th and you may want to attend it as well.  

I'll copy my notes for you.  THANK YOU for covering for me.  Here are  
numbers you can send e-mails to or call and leave a message:

Walter and Marlena Schilling  011 49 8218 89351 schilling.jun@freenet.de

Monika and Bernhard Steinacher 011 49 8232 8932 m.steinacher@schwabmuenchen.de

Walter and Bernhard and Bernhard's daughter, Susanne, speak pretty good 
English and Monika's isn't bad.  Marlena doesn't speak it very well so ask 
for Walter.  Bavaria is 7 hours ahead of Houston.  

Greg,

You can call me on whatever you have, including Midway, SDEC and Medley 
Dunn.  If I have a problem getting to something, I'll find help.

Kay

Kay,

Ann Elizabeth did not provide a designated hitter for the South Dade Energy 
Center (Dade Development Company LLC is Optionee, Certosa Holdings is 
Optionor) nor did she provide one for tne Medley Dunn project.  I have been 
told that the Dunns are considering backing off their ultimatums that they 
gave Ann Elizabeth and I regarding taxes to the town and assumption of 
enviromental liability.  Who do I talk to about the Dunn contract while Ann 
Elizabeth is out?  
Kay Mann is the designated hitter for the Pompano and Deerfied projects while 
I'm on vacation.  I've given her a down load of the status of Greg and 
Steve's projects.  Chris Boehler at A&K will be the designated hitter for 
Midway.  I'm not going to check my voice mail while I'm gone but, if 
necessary, here are the contact numbers while I'm gone.

Walter and Marlena Schilling  011-49-8218-89351 schilling.jun@freenet.de

Monika and Bernhard Steinacher 011-49-8232-8932 m.steinacher@schwabmuenchen.de

If you call, Walter and Bernhard and Bernhard's daughter, Susanne, speak very 
good English.  Monika's isn't bad.  Marlena may get flustered and hang up on 
you.

Best of luck at Deerfield and hope to see Pompano on track when I get back in 
the office on June 11th.  Kay is planning on going to Florida on June 12 for 
the moratorium hearing and the rezoning hearing.

Legal folks -- please let me know of any other legal people who should be 
added to interconnection issue emails.

On May 16, FERC clarified its policy regarding credits for network upgrades 
associated with the interconnection of a generating facility -- all network 
upgrade costs (the cost of all facilities from the point where the generator 
connects to the grid), including those necessary to remedy short-circuit and 
stability problems, should be credited back to the customer that funded the 
upgrades once the delivery service begins.

Once a customer signs up for transmission, then the transmission provider is 
limited to charging the higher of the expansion cost or an embedded cost rate.

Generally, Enron has not procured transmission at the time of interconnection 
and therefore, may be required to pay the network upgrades at the time of 
interconnection; however, the order clarifies that a credit should be 
available to the interconnecting customer or a third party that contracts for 
transmission away from the generator.

I can understand how that can be a problem.  Certainly, every effort can be 
made to expedite the process, and I do think the first time will take the 
longest for obvious reasons. 

For the purposes of scheduling going forward, I think it would help to keep 
that type of time frame in mind, with the thought that maybe it can happen

Kay:

Thanks for the email.  However I am a bit concern that the 2 - 4 processing 
of the forms may not support the Austin Energy construction schedule.  I am 
working on that and will let you know if it does or does not.

Thanks,

Jeffrey

I wouldn't use  an LLC with an prior history.  We might have to get the old 
stuff approved in order to put the equity into TurboPark.  If the LLC paid 
for an interconnect study, it could be a hard cost and we are dead.

I know this seems silly, but hey, it is!

ckm

We have decided to use:  Voyager Development Company, L.L.C. for the new 
Homestead land option.  We had initially planned to use it for an option that 
we let go (Option Agreement never got assigned to Voyager either).  According 
to Greg Krause, the only thing associated with Voyager was an old 
interconnect study request that was paid for and never used.  I feel 
confident that Voyager is "clean" to use.

Kathleen
I talked to Kay about the new land option Greg will be negotiating this 
weekend in Homestead.  She said to put the options in the terminal company, 
not Lauderdale Land, LLC as you had suggested.  Pick one of the other LLCs 
for me and let me know the name.

Thanks.

Question for the team:

If it appears that we may have land which may not be able to stay off balance 
sheet, is it preferable to have the land held by a different LLC than the 
project LLC, with a lease to the E-Next/OBS compliant project co?  

If that is the case, what about the possibility of burdening the land with 
some low dollar hard costs?  I don't have anything in particular in mind, it 
is more of a theoretical question.

Thanks,

Kay

How much is it and should this be the final amount?  One thought I have is 
that maybe we can retool the option agreement so that we pay them a flat fee, 
which is enough to cover the expenditures.  Don't know if this works, but it 
is one thought.  What do you think?

Kay

One more thing on the SDEC project:  According to the option agreement we 
executed last October, we agreed to reimburse Certosa Holdings for actual 
third party costs that they incurred in support of our necessary 
applications, submittals and in seeking local approval.  Several weeks ago, 
we recieved an invoice from Shutts & Bowen, attorney for Certosa Holdings 
requesting reimbursement pursuant to the contract.  I forwarded this invoice 
on th Ann Elizabeth not necessarily to pay for but to review considering this 
whole soft cost hard cost discussion.  I recieved another call this morning 
from Shutts & Bowen asking about the invoice.  What should I do? 
Greg,

You can call me on whatever you have, including Midway, SDEC and Medley 
Dunn.  If I have a problem getting to something, I'll find help.

Kay,

Ann Elizabeth did not provide a designated hitter for the South Dade Energy 
Center (Dade Development Company LLC is Optionee, Certosa Holdings is 
Optionor) nor did she provide one for tne Medley Dunn project.  I have been 
told that the Dunns are considering backing off their ultimatums that they 
gave Ann Elizabeth and I regarding taxes to the town and assumption of 
enviromental liability.  Who do I talk to about the Dunn contract while Ann 
Elizabeth is out?  
Kay Mann is the designated hitter for the Pompano and Deerfied projects while 
I'm on vacation.  I've given her a down load of the status of Greg and 
Steve's projects.  Chris Boehler at A&K will be the designated hitter for 
Midway.  I'm not going to check my voice mail while I'm gone but, if

At the risk of making you crazy, I've come up with a suggested rework of the 
term sheet, as I was having horrible problems with formatting when I was 
doing revisions.  Now all I have to do is fill in the blanks.

I'm ready when you are.

Could you email me the option agreement?

I think the invoice was for between $20,000 and $30,000, but I can't 
remember.  AEW has the invoice.  This probably will not be the final as we 
will need to work with them in discussions with DERM on delaying the landfill 
closure and in moving jurisdiction of the project from CZAB to the County 
Commissioners.   I think Shutts & Bowen (who may get stiffed by their client 
if this deal blows up) and Certosa Holdings would be open to any suggestions

Hi Gregg,

I'm back.  I don't know what the deal was with my cell phone this week.  
Perhaps the problem was the weak signal in the area.  Several people 
commented that they had problems reaching me, and my phone was on almost the 
entire time. In fact, I  made many calls, but I ususally checked to see if I 
had a signal first.  Sorry for the inconvenience.

I'll take a look at the DASH, etc, and get up to speed so that I can speak 
intelligently.

I've skimmed it.  I see that the option expires August 9th.  Are we planning 
to renew it?  If so maybe we can renew early and fix what we can to preserve 
some optionality (no pun intended) and cover the fee issue.  Might take too 
long to address the immediate issue.

I don't see anyway we can get around the balance sheet issue unless we let 
the option expire and then reoption, but in that case the option payment 
would have to be smaller (acct says an option of 5% creates a problem as it 
would be considered a down payment).  Just fyi.

Kathleen, was the option recorded, or just a memo of option, or neither?  I'm 
just wondering what is public info.

Herman is out of the office today, but I can discuss the fee issue to get his 
vote.  

More to come...

Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of 
the agreement:

How are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily 
average, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?

Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?

We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?

We aren't making money on gas, right?

Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to 
the picture?

Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  

It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the 
following, in words and/or formulae:

The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) 
formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to 
work on.   Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost 
of power)?  How are we setting the bogey?  Formula?  Subject to audit? Two 
bogeys or one (gas and oil)?

What is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or 
two would be helpful as a reality check.  What costs are included on the buy 
and sell side?

Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used.

Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits.

What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split 
costs/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?

It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these 
questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.

Thanks,

Kay

One project co is good enough.

ckm

Kay, 
One of the first things we do after we execute an option agreement is to get 
into the interconnect queue.  To do so, we must enter into an interconnect 
study agreement and in the past we have entered into these agreements using 
the same project agreement that has the option agreement.  Are you saying 
that we need two project companies for each project: one for the option 
agreement and one for the interconnect study agreement?  As you may know, it 
has taken 11 months to get to the point in the Midway project from the time 
we executed an interconnect study agreement with FPL to today when we are 
ready to begin negotiating a construction and connection agreement.  Would 
you please clarify the issue for me? 

Okay.  I will set up a new LLC (Homestead Development Company, LLC, if 
available).  Would it be preferable for its sole member to be Lauderdale Land 
Development Company, LLC or ENA?

I wouldn't use  an LLC with an prior history.  We might have to get the old 
stuff approved in order to put the equity into TurboPark.  If the LLC paid 
for an interconnect study, it could be a hard cost and we are dead.

I know this seems silly, but hey, it is!

Gentlemen,

I've been told that the parties have agreed to extend the letter agreement 
until June 15, and that we will have a signed long term document by then.  

David,  I would think I simple letter agreement should work.  I can get it 
working from here.

I'm working on what was the most recent form that I had re the long term 
deal, which should address some of David's issues.  I'm not sure yet when 
I'll have it done, but it has moved up the list of priorities.

Talk to you soon, I'm sure.

Kay

I promised to send you the arbitration case we discussed. It's IP Timberlands 
Operating Co. Ltd. v Denmiss Corp., 726 So.2d 96 (Miss. 1998). Please send me 
the cite to the case you were referring to. 

Thanks

Hi.

Did the CA get signed and sent, and did it come back?

Thanks,

Kay

Unless the first option expires (and the original premium is expensed), you 
add the original payment to the renewal premium to determine the percentage.  
If we can't beat the percentage game, we can have the land on the balance 
sheet and that won't put the entire project on it.  Don't ask me to splain 
that, because I can't.  If the land is going to be on the balance sheet, you 
would think that it would be better to have $1.3 on than $4.2.  However, one 
thing I don't know (haven't asked) is what the environmental restrictions are 
with our financing vehicle.  I don't know if the land has to be clean before 
it can go into the vehicle.  I can ask.  If it is required to be clean, then 
you may be back to the $4.2 anyway.  

Kay

PS.  Feel like Alice in Wonderland  yet?

Yes we do want to renew the option through September of next year and we will 
need to persuade them to lower the option premium.  Her is a thought:  the 
land fill closure cost is approximately $2.9 million.  Could we create a new 
option agreement that states that the strike price is $4.2 million ($1.3 the 
original strike price plus the cost of land fill closure cost) so we could 
pay an option premium of up to $210,000 (5% of $4.2 million).  At closing, we 
reduce the purchase price by the costs yet to be incurred in the closing the 
land fill.  Since Certosa Holdings will not start the closure until they are 
assured that we will exercise the option if even then, the net cost to us 
would drop back to  the original strike price.  Could we get this past the 
accountants?

Only the memorandum of option was recorded.

I've skimmed it.  I see that the option expires August 9th.  Are we planning 
to renew it?  If so maybe we can renew early and fix what we can to preserve 
some optionality (no pun intended) and cover the fee issue.  Might take too

Enron may have a land lease with Project Co.  In NO event may the land be 
burdened with low dollar hard costs/improvements - no materiality limits and 
no hard costs allowed.

Way cool.  I'd let Reagan follow up.

Reagan has not received the CA, but has a call in to the Developer regarding 
the status.  I will be happy to call Doug Pedigo if you want me to.

Also, the InterGen office that Raimund is working with is in Florida (Miami).

Hi.

Did the CA get signed and sent, and did it come back?

Thanks,

Here's the latest version.  It looks ok to me.  The most substantive aspect 
of it is that Calumet Power (or its affiliate) could end up the indemnity 
obligations under the agreement.  (in other words, an entity without a lot of 
money to fund indemnity obligations)  In my opinion this isn't important in 
the context of the option.

Unless someone objects, I'll tell PERC that Enron is ready to go with the 
assignment.

Don't know the answers. We need to visit with Herman Manis to get his buy-in 
on an approach.  I have a call in to him on another transaction, so I'll 
ask.  Are you in Houston today?

ckm

Does the first option need to expire or can we terminate prior to expiration 
and concurrent with execution of a new option agreement?  I got a call from 
the owner of Certosa Holdings pleading for help on reimbursement of those 
legal fees.   If we are going to pay a flat fee and renegotiate this 
agreement, I think we need to do so quickly.   Regardless, I need to tell 
them something soon.  They are getting desparate.  I've a call in to Taffy 
Milligan. AEW's assistant to locate the Shutts & Bowen invoice.  

I understand we have engaged Shutts & Bowen in Tallahassee to review some 
property tax issue.  Cound this be an avenue to avoid this on balance sheet 
hard cost thang?

Unless the first option expires (and the original premium is expensed), you 
add the original payment to the renewal premium to determine the percentage.  
If we can't beat the percentage game, we can have the land on the balance 
sheet and that won't put the entire project on it.  Don't ask me to splain 
that, because I can't.  If the land is going to be on the balance sheet, you 
would think that it would be better to have $1.3 on than $4.2.  However, one 
thing I don't know (haven't asked) is what the environmental restrictions are 
with our financing vehicle.  I don't know if the land has to be clean before 
it can go into the vehicle.  I can ask.  If it is required to be clean, then 
you may be back to the $4.2 anyway.  

Kay

PS.  Feel like Alice in Wonderland  yet?

Yes we do want to renew the option through September of next year and we will 
need to persuade them to lower the option premium.  Her is a thought:  the 
land fill closure cost is approximately $2.9 million.  Could we create a new 
option agreement that states that the strike price is $4.2 million ($1.3 the 
original strike price plus the cost of land fill closure cost) so we could 
pay an option premium of up to $210,000 (5% of $4.2 million).  At closing, we 
reduce the purchase price by the costs yet to be incurred in the closing the 
land fill.  Since Certosa Holdings will not start the closure until they are 
assured that we will exercise the option if even then, the net cost to us 
would drop back to  the original strike price.  Could we get this past the 
accountants?

Only the memorandum of option was recorded.

I've skimmed it.  I see that the option expires August 9th.  Are we planning 
to renew it?  If so maybe we can renew early and fix what we can to preserve 
some optionality (no pun intended) and cover the fee issue.  Might take too 
long to address the immediate issue.

I don't see anyway we can get around the balance sheet issue unless we let 
the option expire and then reoption, but in that case the option payment 
would have to be smaller (acct says an option of 5% creates a problem as it 
would be considered a down payment).  Just fyi.

Kathleen, was the option recorded, or just a memo of option, or neither?  I'm 
just wondering what is public info.

Herman is out of the office today, but I can discuss the fee issue to get his 
vote.  

More to come...

ckm

I think the invoice was for between $20,000 and $30,000, but I can't 
remember.  AEW has the invoice.  This probably will not be the final as we 
will need to work with them in discussions with DERM on delaying the landfill 
closure and in moving jurisdiction of the project from CZAB to the County 
Commissioners.   I think Shutts & Bowen (who may get stiffed by their client 
if this deal blows up) and Certosa Holdings would be open to any suggestions 
and we need to renegotiate the option anyway.  Shall I call and suggest this 
this flat fee for retooling the option agreement to them or shall we do it 
together?  I,m not sure I could explain to them acequately the idiosyncrasies 
of our accounting requirements.

How much is it and should this be the final amount?  One thought I have is 
that maybe we can retool the option agreement so that we pay them a flat fee, 
which is enough to cover the expenditures.  Don't know if this works, but it 
is one thought.  What do you think?

Kay

One more thing on the SDEC project:  According to the option agreement we 
executed last October, we agreed to reimburse Certosa Holdings for actual 
third party costs that they incurred in support of our necessary 
applications, submittals and in seeking local approval.  Several weeks ago, 
we recieved an invoice from Shutts & Bowen, attorney for Certosa Holdings 
requesting reimbursement pursuant to the contract.  I forwarded this invoice 
on th Ann Elizabeth not necessarily to pay for but to review considering this 
whole soft cost hard cost discussion.  I recieved another call this morning 
from Shutts & Bowen asking about the invoice.  What should I do? 
Greg,

You can call me on whatever you have, including Midway, SDEC and Medley 
Dunn.  If I have a problem getting to something, I'll find help.

Kay

Kay,

Ann Elizabeth did not provide a designated hitter for the South Dade Energy 
Center (Dade Development Company LLC is Optionee, Certosa Holdings is 
Optionor) nor did she provide one for tne Medley Dunn project.  I have been 
told that the Dunns are considering backing off their ultimatums that they 
gave Ann Elizabeth and I regarding taxes to the town and assumption of 
enviromental liability.  Who do I talk to about the Dunn contract while Ann 
Elizabeth is out?  
Kay Mann is the designated hitter for the Pompano and Deerfied projects while 
I'm on vacation.  I've given her a down load of the status of Greg and 
Steve's projects.  Chris Boehler at A&K will be the designated hitter for 
Midway.  I'm not going to check my voice mail while I'm gone but, if 
necessary, here are the contact numbers while I'm gone.

Walter and Marlena Schilling  011-49-8218-89351 schilling.jun@freenet.de

Monika and Bernhard Steinacher 011-49-8232-8932 m.steinacher@schwabmuenchen.de

If you call, Walter and Bernhard and Bernhard's daughter, Susanne, speak very 
good English.  Monika's isn't bad.  Marlena may get flustered and hang up on 
you.

Best of luck at Deerfield and hope to see Pompano on track when I get back in 
the office on June 11th.  Kay is planning on going to Florida on June 12 for 
the moratorium hearing and the rezoning hearing.

Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of 
the agreement:

How are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily 
average, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?

Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?

We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?

We aren't making money on gas, right?

Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to 
the picture?

Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  

It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the 
following, in words and/or formulae:

The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) 
formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to 
work on.   Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost 
of power)?  How are we setting the bogey?  Formula?  Subject to audit? Two 
bogeys or one (gas and oil)?

What is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or 
two would be helpful as a reality check.  What costs are included on the buy 
and sell side?

Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used.

Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits.

What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split 
costs/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?

It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these 
questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.

Thanks,

Kay

[Fairley, David]  

Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of 
the agreement:

How are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily 
average, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?
[Fairley, David]  
Each utility is obligated to provide the heat rate information to use in the 
appropriate Exhibit and the Stack Model.  As conditions change the utilities 
must update this info.  We are tracking heat rates based on actual fuel 
usage.  Services and Orig agreed yesterday to add language that requires a 
quarterly review of heat rate data to determine if the assumptions being used 
are satisfactiry -- it can never be exact, but it should be accurate within a 
band of acceptability.  No GADS.  Heat rates will be adjusted in the model as 
often as necessary to account for significant changes such as hotter ambient 
temps..

Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?
[Fairley, David]  
Yes, their units are too small.  We have discussed this with the customer, 
and with our internal air permit guys.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  They have Title V permits, and they are faxing them to 
us today.  They have no run hour limitations on gas, however, they are 
limited on oil.  Will need to get that summary to Kay as soon as possible.

We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?
[Fairley, David]  
We won't buy and sell fuel oil.  We may dispatch on oil at start-up, or we 
may switch to oil and sell the gas if profitable, which constitutes a Product 
transaction with the resulting profit split.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  We need to state that MDEA and Cities are responsible 
for maintaining fuel oil supplies.

We aren't making money on gas, right?
[Fairley, David]  
We make money on gas two ways.  The first is outside the contract, and is 
basicly any internal profit on re-sale of gas to the Cities.  The second way 
we can make money on gas is when the gas trade is in the form of a Product 
trade, and those procedures apply.

Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to 
the picture?
[Fairley, David]  
Yes, will send separately.

Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  
[Fairley, David]  
The Marketing Strategy, the Trading and Risk Policy, and the Description of 
Asset Management have been upated.  The other Exhibits have not been 
modified.  The Marketing Strategy and Trading & Risk Policy have been 
discussed at length with MDEA (MDEA commercial, not legal), and their 
comments/questions incorporated.
  
 

It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the 
following, in words and/or formulae:

The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) 
formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to 
work on.  
[Fairley, David]  
Thought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the 
parties.  Will look at it again.  Conceptually, MDEA, Services Group, and 
Orig are in full agreement, so we need to make sure that the contract 
language is clear enough.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  See attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example.

 Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of 
power)? 
[Fairley, David]  
There are three considerations on this: (1) who wears imbalance exposure?, 
(2) who manages imbalances (hourly type activity), and (3) who pays for 
imbalances?  Imbalances are billed by Entergy directly to MDEA under their 
Network Services Agreement.  EPMI's hourly desk manages the load/resource 
items hourly, but MDEA has the exposure (physical and price) to imbalances.  
Weather/load changes, and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances 
(they happen, they are uncontrollable, and we fix them) which EPMI's hourly 
desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions 
and obligations of the parties.  A different section in the contract states 
that MDEA wears the exposure.

 How are we setting the bogey?    Formula?   [Fairley, David]  The bogey is 
set when the load projection and stack models are run each day.  Both parties 
participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and 
planning the day's activities.  
[Rorschach, Reagan]  Records of bogey decisions will be archieved

Subject to audit?  [Fairley, David]    Yes, but they would be auditing 
something that is jointly derived each day.  Frankly, they would like to have 
less involvement; ie, they trust us to do it all, but we are requiring them 
to participate and buy in every day.  

Two bogeys or one (gas and oil)?
[Fairley, David]  
One bogey for power.  Gas is an input for determining the bogey.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  Bogey set day-ahead.

What is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or 
two would be helpful as a reality check.  
[Fairley, David]  
This is in the pricing calc's.  Should we have a definition?

What costs are included on the buy and sell side [Fairley, David]  see cost 
definition being provided separately.
 

Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used. 
[Fairley, David]    See definition in my mark-up's to the main agreement. 

Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits. 
[Fairley, David]   Services and Orig are reviewing these, but other than what 
was mentioned above, probably no changes unless you see a specific area that 
is a problem. 

What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split 
costs/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?
[Rorschach, Reagan]  I will be getting exhibits of the reporting both daily 
and monthly.  We need to make sure to limit our info providing 
responsibilities to those reports.

It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these 
questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.

Thanks,

Kay

1.  Need details re item 1  below.  Please suggest language (band of

6.  Do I have the latest draft of Marketing/Risk policies?

7. Bogey calc only addresses gas.  What if the fuel of choice is fuel oil?  
Does the fuel cost and heat rate change?

Please point me to the defn of profit by cutting and pasting from wherever it

Bob,

Here's the bill of sale we didn't use on the last deal.  I don't know how 
much good it will do you, but at least it gives you some tax language.  As I 
mentioned, the last deal was supposed to be a "wire me money, I'll sell you 
stuff" deal, but it didn't  happen.

I'd like to see the installment sale form once it gets fixed up, if possible.

Days after state regulators gave Duke Energy the go-ahead to expand its Moss 
Landing Power Plant near Monterey Bay last fall, documents show four 
environmental groups made their own deal with the utility giant. The four 
signed an agreement not to "participate in any lawsuit (or) regulatory 
challenge" that might slow or stop the project in exchange for a financial 
concession: $1 million from Duke for environmental "monitoring and research." 

Balancing power generation and environmental protection always has been 
difficult. But today, as power-starved California scrambles to find and 
permit new energy sources, some fear the Moss Landing agreement shows that 
money can sway even environmentalists -- and tip the scales too far in favor 
of economic development.

Environmentalists who signed the agreement, though, said that despite their 
concerns about the plant expansion, they had little chance of stopping it, 
especially after it was approved by the California Energy Commission and 
Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board.

So they took the potentially controversial step: entering into an agreement 
with Duke for financial resources to pay for studies of the plant's impact on 
the marine environment.

Other environmentalists, though, criticized that approach.

Duke Energy's efforts to modernize the Moss Landing Power Plant resulted in 
mitigation payments to environmental and other groups, including:

$7 million to the Elkhorn Slough Foundation to mitigate the plant's use of 
seawater.

$425,000 to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation over three years to monitor 
heated seawater discharge in the ocean.

$1 million to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation over five years to 
monitor water quality through a program sponsored by Save Our Shores, the 
Center for Marine Conservation, the Friends of the Sea Otter and the Otter 
Project.

$100,000 to the Marine Mammal Center to relocate its triage center for 
injured animals onto power plant property.

$3.4 million to the Moss Landing Chamber of Commerce over 20 years for 
infrastructure improvements in the Moss Landing community.

$100,000 to design and construct a boardwalk for additional beach access in 
Moss Landing.

$60,000 for an environmental assessment for a proposed Elkhorn Slough Circle 
Trail. If approved, Duke would provide an additional $250,000 endowment to 
maintain the trail.

"It is very disheartening," said Carolyn Nielson, a retired teacher who along 
with some other local residents is waging a battle against what they consider 
an environmentally harmful power plant cooling system.

"These environmental groups have the expertise, the biologists, the 
attorneys," said Nielson, who has taken her case to the State Water Resources 
Control Board. "We could have been much more successful with their help. But 
there wouldn't have been any financial reward in it for them."

Such criticisms are off-base, according to Warner Chabot, regional director 
for the Center for Marine Conservation, a national environmental group that 
was among those to sign the deal. He said environmentalists got the best deal 
possible in the current energy climate.

"Look at what's happening with power plant approvals in California right 
now," said Chabot, referring to the state's push to bring new energy sources 
on line.

The Moss Landing project -- which is scheduled to add 1,060 megawatts in 
2002, enough to serve one million homes -- is a key part of that energy 
expansion plan.

No money will go to the four environmental groups -- the Center for Marine 
Conservation, along with Save Our Shores, Friends of the Sea Otter and the 
Otter Project. It will be routed, in five yearly installments of $200,000 
each, to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation, a nonprofit organization that 
helps support sanctuary programs, including scientific research.

Chabot helped found the sanctuary foundation and sits on its board. He said 
the money will be used to monitor the health of Elkhorn Slough, a 
biologically rich estuary that borders the plant and is linked to Monterey 
Bay.

"Not a dime comes to the Center for Marine Conservation," he said. "Not a 
penny comes to me."

Duke representatives said the controversy about the arrangement has been 
stirred by a handful of people.

"It's a million dollars worth of water quality studies," said Duke spokesman 
Tom Williams. "Our whole effort wasn't to try to buy anybody off. It was 
designed to help increase people's comfort level where there wasn't a comfort 
level."

The $1 million agreement signed in November is part of a package of more than 
$12 million in Duke payments to civil, government and environmental groups in 
connection with the plant modernization.

The heftiest award -- $7 million to the Elkhorn Slough Foundation, a 
nonprofit environmental organization -- was negotiated by state agencies to 
"mitigate" environmental impacts of the plant.

Formed in 1982, the slough foundation exists to promote "the wise use and 
conservation of Elkhorn Slough and surrounding wetlands," its Web site says. 
However, some environmentalists say the state-approved mitigation plan is 
inadequate.

"If you want to say, 'Who did Duke roll with a big chunk of money?' I would 
say they rolled the California Energy Commission and the Regional Water Board 
for the price of mitigation," Chabot said. "The agencies got bought off 
cheap. And the environment got taken to the cleaners."

Duke's Williams strongly disagreed. Environmental mitigation "must be based 
on science, not on buying anybody off," he said. "That is inappropriate, and 
we would not participate in that.

"That suggestion is offensive to us. And it should be offensive to any 
environmentalist."

Bob Haussler, head of the Energy Commission's environmental protection 
office, said the mitigation plan is biologically sound. "We are confident it 
will improve the slough ecosystem," he said.

Madeline Clark, a local businesswoman and founder of Monterey Parkway -- a 
citizens group that scrutinizes local public works projects -- called the 
recipients of Duke's payments a "shopping list" of government agencies, 
environmental groups and civic organizations. She was particularly critical 
of the $1 million deal with environmental groups.

"You know what bothers me?" Clark said. "Environmental groups get tons of 
donations. Their purpose is to protect and defend the environment. If a big 
corporation like Duke can come in and buy them off, I have a real problem 
with that."

Construction began in November on Duke's project to add 1,060 megawatts of 
natural gas-fired electrical capacity to the Moss Landing plant, purchased 
from PG&E in 1998.

If the expansion is finished next year, as scheduled, it would account for 
more than 30 percent of all new generation in California in 2002.

"This is a big deal," said Williams, the Duke spokesman. "It will be the 
largest plant in California. If that plant is delayed a month or two, we lose 
the summer of 2002. And that affects not only Duke Energy, but the state of 
California."

Opponents say it's not the power they oppose, but the plant's cooling system, 
which will pump about 1.2 billion gallons of seawater each day from Moss 
Landing Harbor. Such pumping, they say, will degrade Elkhorn Slough. They 
argue for an alternative cooling system, such as towers that re-circulate 
water.

"Basically, what that plant will do is take 25 percent of the volume of the 
harbor and slough, run it through a pipe and dump it back into the ocean with 
much of the marine life cooked and dead," said Steve Shimek, executive 
director of the Otter Project.

For Shimek and other environmentalists, scientific studies commissioned by 
Duke during the permitting process left key questions unanswered about the 
plant's impact on the environment.

"There was no scientific evidence that would literally point to Duke causing 
harm to the environment," said Vicki Nichols, executive director of Save Our 
Shores. "We felt we didn't have strong standing to sue."

Instead, the environmentalists began negotiating with Duke for financial 
payments for studies of environmental impacts of the modernization project.

The process "gave me tremendous pause and great concern," Nichols said. "I 
knew there was going to be some perception that we were doing the wrong 
thing."

She was right.

"As far as I'm concerned, with the price-gouging going on by the energy 
wholesalers, they are just receiving stolen goods," said Clark, of the 
citizens group.

Her skepticism was sharpened by the recent disclosure that Duke Energy 
approached Gov. Gray Davis with a secret deal offering financial concessions 
if the state dropped lawsuits and investigations into the power generator.

Chabot, with the Center for Marine Conservation, discouraged any comparison 
between the two offers, calling it "grossly unfair and inaccurate."

Regardless of what was intended with the payments, Nielson said they stain 
the process. "It is so destructive in terms of making everyone cynical," she 
said.

Shimek took a different view. "We convinced Duke to spend $1 million toward 
monitoring that, frankly, five years from now could very well come back to 
haunt them," he said.

"Did we do the right thing? I have no idea. Did we try our best? Yes, we 
did."

1.  Need details re item 1  below.  Please suggest language (band of 
acceptability, etc) which I will massage and incorporate.

6.  Do I have the latest draft of Marketing/Risk policies?

7. Bogey calc only addresses gas.  What if the fuel of choice is fuel oil?  
Does the fuel cost and heat rate change?

Please point me to the defn of profit by cutting and pasting from wherever it 
is.  I did  a quick search and couldn't find it, but I didn't do a page turn 
to locate it.

Thanks,

Kay

[Fairley, David]  

Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of 
the agreement:

1. How are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily 
average, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?
[Fairley, David]  
Each utility is obligated to provide the heat rate information to use in the 
appropriate Exhibit and the Stack Model.  As conditions change the utilities 
must update this info.  We are tracking heat rates based on actual fuel 
usage.  Services and Orig agreed yesterday to add language that requires a 
quarterly review of heat rate data to determine if the assumptions being used 
are satisfactiry -- it can never be exact, but it should be accurate within a 
band of acceptability.  No GADS.  Heat rates will be adjusted in the model as 
often as necessary to account for significant changes such as hotter ambient 
temps..

2. Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?
[Fairley, David]  
Yes, their units are too small.  We have discussed this with the customer, 
and with our internal air permit guys.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  They have Title V permits, and they are faxing them to 
us today.  They have no run hour limitations on gas, however, they are 
limited on oil.  Will need to get that summary to Kay as soon as possible.

3. We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?
[Fairley, David]  
We won't buy and sell fuel oil.  We may dispatch on oil at start-up, or we 
may switch to oil and sell the gas if profitable, which constitutes a Product 
transaction with the resulting profit split.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  We need to state that MDEA and Cities are responsible 
for maintaining fuel oil supplies.

4. We aren't making money on gas, right?
[Fairley, David]  
We make money on gas two ways.  The first is outside the contract, and is 
basicly any internal profit on re-sale of gas to the Cities.  The second way 
we can make money on gas is when the gas trade is in the form of a Product 
trade, and those procedures apply.

5. Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in 
to the picture?
[Fairley, David]  
Yes, will send separately.

6. Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  
[Fairley, David]  
The Marketing Strategy, the Trading and Risk Policy, and the Description of 
Asset Management have been upated.  The other Exhibits have not been 
modified.  The Marketing Strategy and Trading & Risk Policy have been 
discussed at length with MDEA (MDEA commercial, not legal), and their 
comments/questions incorporated.
  
 

7. It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the 
following, in words and/or formulae:

The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) 
formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to 
work on.  
[Fairley, David]  
Thought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the 
parties.  Will look at it again.  Conceptually, MDEA, Services Group, and 
Orig are in full agreement, so we need to make sure that the contract 
language is clear enough.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  See attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example.

 Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of 
power)? 
[Fairley, David]  
There are three considerations on this: (1) who wears imbalance exposure?, 
(2) who manages imbalances (hourly type activity), and (3) who pays for 
imbalances?  Imbalances are billed by Entergy directly to MDEA under their 
Network Services Agreement.  EPMI's hourly desk manages the load/resource 
items hourly, but MDEA has the exposure (physical and price) to imbalances.  
Weather/load changes, and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances 
(they happen, they are uncontrollable, and we fix them) which EPMI's hourly 
desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions 
and obligations of the parties.  A different section in the contract states 
that MDEA wears the exposure.

 How are we setting the bogey?    Formula?   [Fairley, David]  The bogey is 
set when the load projection and stack models are run each day.  Both parties 
participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and 
planning the day's activities.  
[Rorschach, Reagan]  Records of bogey decisions will be archieved

Subject to audit?  [Fairley, David]    Yes, but they would be auditing 
something that is jointly derived each day.  Frankly, they would like to have 
less involvement; ie, they trust us to do it all, but we are requiring them 
to participate and buy in every day.  

Two bogeys or one (gas and oil)?
[Fairley, David]  
One bogey for power.  Gas is an input for determining the bogey.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  Bogey set day-ahead.

What is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or 
two would be helpful as a reality check.  
[Fairley, David]  
This is in the pricing calc's.  Should we have a definition?

What costs are included on the buy and sell side [Fairley, David]  see cost 
definition being provided separately.
 

Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used. 
[Fairley, David]    See definition in my mark-up's to the main agreement. 

Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits. 
[Fairley, David]   Services and Orig are reviewing these, but other than what 
was mentioned above, probably no changes unless you see a specific area that 
is a problem. 

What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split 
costs/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?
[Rorschach, Reagan]  I will be getting exhibits of the reporting both daily 
and monthly.  We need to make sure to limit our info providing 
responsibilities to those reports.

It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these 
questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.

Thanks,

Kay

Duke Energy, Environmentalists Strike Deal over California Plant

Hello.

I gave the Matagorda County Fair & Livestock Association $2050, and filled 
out the form for the match.  Please advise if this has been paid, as they are 
sending me a bill for the $2050, plus a finance charge.

Thank you,

Hi Wilson,

We discussed asking the counterparties for opinion letters.  Could you 
outline what you think we should ask for, or alternatively, just draft it?

Thanks,

Kay

Absolutely.

Kay

I'll be happy to do so, but can I please, please beg off until nest week? 
Several large matters have conspired to hit at the same time and I'm 
currently snowed.

We'll need to change the date of the doc once we have an idea of when it will 
be signed.

Kay

Hi there,

I would like to have one email with electronic versions of the letter 
agreement, and all the attachments except the turbine contract.

Thanks,

Kay

Here's a first draft of the NRG loi.  

Kay

Thanks.

Did I tell you that I spoke with GE about the assignment, and their initial 
response was very positive.

NorthWestern is predicting closing in July.  

Kay

Wouldn't it be nice to not have a fire drill at the end? At least we will be 
ready.

I'm can't wait to see what their lenders will come up with.  Ben's hoping it 
will fall through and he can sell these again, I think.  

Kay

Great.  I will focus on the closing checklist to ensure that all of ENA's
closing deliveries are in order well before closing.

MIR 

Thanks.

There would seem to me to be two questions--the threshold one is whether the
site is within Rocky Mount's service territory.  If it is, then what
obligation does NCNG have with respect to the construction of a delivery
point.  I haven't reviewed the annexation statutes yet, but based on my
initial reading of the Service Area Territory Agreement between Rocky Mount
and NCNG, once annexed the site would come within Rocky Mount's purview to
serve, and, although a "mutually agreeable" delivery point would have to be
negotiated, NCNG would at least have to negotiate that in good faith.  

The January 13, 1992 Service Area Territory Agreement gives Rocky Mount the
right to distribute natural gas within the city's incorporated limits as
well as a specified area outside the incorporated limits.   The contract
goes on to provide that should any part of that perimeter be annexed into
the city, "the respective rights of the parties as to service in any such
portion shall be determined by applicable case law and the General Statutes
of North Carolina. . ."  The contract further provides that absent an order
of the NCUC to the contrary, NCNG agrees that Rocky Mount has the right to
serve all end users within the "aforementioned" area--presumably referring
to the annexed area, although the agreement is not a model of clarity.

So, at least based on this language, Rocky Mount's right to serve arguably
tracks its incorporated limits, whatever they might be.  (Jonathan and I are
looking at annexation law to see what else might be lurking out there).  

The 1992 Service agreement provides, In Article IV, provides that points of
devliery for all natural gas purchased or transported under the agreement
with NCNG shall be "at the following locations and other stations added at
mutually agreeable locations in the future. . ." In the Third Amendment to
the Natural Gas Service Agreement, dated March 10, 1997, new language and
delivery points are negotiated upon, but the principle is still included
that  other stations may be added at "mutually agreeable locations in the
future."  The question which then arises is what Rocky Mount would have to
give in exchange.  In the 1997 agreement, Rocky Mount agreed to an extention
of terms of the of ten years, until December 6,

Yes, E-Next.  You might advise Jeff that we will probably need a substitute 
LOC post-assignment.

Kay

Kay,

Is E-Next Generation LLC the correct entity as beneficiary?

Chris

Chris,

The bank will issue the LOC by the end of next week, perhaps as early as
Wednesday.  We are using E-Next Generation LLC as the beneficiary.  The LOC
will be mailed to you.  Do you still require a Lien Waiver?

Also, do you want new invoices?  If so, will one for $1,502,355 be
sufficient?

Regards,

Jeff

Jeff,

Can you give me an update on where GE stands on providing the Letter of
Credit as discussed in my letter of 21 May 2001.

Hi Kara,

I haven't written because I haven't figured out what we learned at the 
meeting.  We can discuss next week at our conference.  We are arranging to 
have Michael re-tested.  I think it is more of an issue of a difference 
between potential and performance.  Michael has been tested in the past, and 
tests as extraordinarily bright, but he has had some performance issues which 
don't match up.  At least that's how I understand it. He just has some 
disconnects which we are working to overcome, but I must admit to not 
understanding it all.

I left you a note about Michael possibly missing next week.  After I dropped 
him off this am, I had a thought that next week might be when they visit in 
1st grade, in which case we probably wouldn't want him to miss that 
opportunity.  I think he is excited about 1st grade, so you must be doing a 
great job of getting the kids prepared.

Thanks for everything, and see you next week!

Kay

My suggestions:

Schedule reflects amount due for cancellation on or before the stated dates?

Kay, see attached.  The monthly fee should be $13,003.  I took the $300k we 
have all been discussing and backed out the $12,500 they paid under the ILA 
terms.

Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of 
the agreement:

How are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily 
average, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?

Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?

We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?

We aren't making money on gas, right?

Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to 
the picture?

Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  

It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the 
following, in words and/or formulae:

The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) 
formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to 
work on.   Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost 
of power)?  How are we setting the bogey?  Formula?  Subject to audit? Two 
bogeys or one (gas and oil)?

What is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or 
two would be helpful as a reality check.  What costs are included on the buy 
and sell side?

Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used.

Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits.

What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split 
costs/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?

It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these 
questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.

I don't understand the last sentence.

The value in the table is the beginning balance for each month.  So if they 
cancel in the middle of the month, they should pay the balance at the 
beginning of that month and no prorated minimum monthly fee.  If you prorate 
it on both ends, you end up getting the total balance shown at the beginning 
of the month.

Schedule reflects amount due for cancellation on or before the stated dates?

Hi Ben,

I've given it a quick look. Looks a lot different from when I last saw it.  I 
don't see a triggering event on the obligations in 2 a.  Was there another 
fix agreed to by all (maybe the "as required by law" language?)  Also, any 
idea why the service charge language was deleted in b?  Maybe it isn't a 
problem.  Also, do you have a copyy of the site plan approval?  

Talk to you soon,

This is just too funny not to pass along!  Have a great weekend!

A big city lawyer went duck hunting in South Louisiana. He shot and 
dropped a bird, but it fell into a farmer's field on the other 
side of a fence. 

As the lawyer climbed over the fence, an elderly farmer drove up on? his 
tractor and asked him what he was doing. The litigator responded, "I shot a 
duck and it fell in this field, and now I'm going in to retrieve it." 

The old farmer replied. "This is my property, and you are not 
coming over here." 

The indignant lawyer said, "I am one of the best trial attorneys in the U.S. 
and, if you don't let me get that duck, I'll sue you and 
take everything you own." 

The old farmer smiled and said, "Apparently, you don't know how we do things 
in Louisiana. We settle small disagreements like this with the Louisiana 
Three Kick Rule." 

The lawyer asked, "What is the Louisiana Three Kick Rule?" 

The Farmer replied. "Well, first I kick you three times and then you kick me 
three times, and so on, back and forth, until someone gives up." 

The attorney quickly thought about the proposed contest and decided that he 
could easily take the old codger. He agreed to abide by the local custom. The 
old farmer slowly climbed down from the tractor and 
walked up to the city feller. His first kick planted the toe of his heavy 
work boot into the lawyer's groin and dropped him to his knees. His second 
kick nearly ripped the man's nose off his face. The barrister was flat on his 
belly when the farmer's third kick to a kidney nearly caused him to give up. 

The lawyer summoned every bit of his will and managed to get 
to his feet and said, "Okay, you old coot now it's my turn." 

(I love this part......) 

The old farmer smiled and said, "Naw, I give up. You can have 
the duck." 

Tough question.  What happens if they don't pay their legal bills?  Won't 
they have difficulty closing?  We can pay their consulting fee up front. 
Maybe we can pay it into an escrow account.   

What is our concern?  They don't have to use lawyers if they don't want to, 
and Shutts doesn't have to work for them if they are uncomfortable.  
Obviously, Shutts has the ability to quote an upfront retainer.  I'm sure 
they've thought of that all ready.

I guess I'm not clear on our level of involvement with their lawyers.

I believe my availability is good for Wednesday.

Kay

Kay,

I spoke to Raul Salas of Shutts & Bowen re: amending the arrangment we have 
for the Certosa Holdings property.  He called me back to say that his client 
will be in Miami Wednesday but wanted us to pay the Shutts & Bowen invoice 
before we meet.  I think Certosa Holdings is not paying its bills.  But they 
did remove the last lien on the property.  We will need to develop a 
structure where we pay something to Certosa Holdings so it can recoup some 
costs but we will also need to cover future legal and consulting costs 
incurred by Certosa Holdings. Can you help??  Would you be available for at 
least a call Wednesday or Thursday?  

I'll be back in Miami Tuesday but I can be reached over the weekend on my 
cell 713 857 0367 or my pager 877 461 4413.  I'll also try to check my email

I've taken the liberty of drafting a form of extension letter to extend the

I suspect Reagan will be distributing to the commercial folks, but I thought 
I would give you a heads up.

preamble stuff ready, I'm happy to put it in now.

PS  The salutation is to "Gentlemen".  Are the members of the commission and

notes could be included in a mark-up sent back to VEPCO; there is one marked 
"Note to Enron" that is intended to be deleted before we send this out.)

The Agreement, as might be expected, is very  one-sided and is written 
primarily for their protection.  It is also very repetitive in places, 
although I did not attempt to eliminate the repetition on the theory that the 
fewer changes we propose the better and we can probably live with the 
repetition.  There are several provisions or concepts I would like to suggest 
we include from the form I had prepared a couple of weeks ago (which was 
based on the EPSA model form, and was clearly more favorable to the 
generation owner than VEPCO's form.)  I have not yet included these changes, 
as I thought we should discuss them first and decide how best to proceed on 
this draft.  Those provisions are as follows (section references are to the 
draft I prepared):

2.43.  Right to tell VEPCO to suspend or terminate work on interconnection 
facilities.

2.4.4  Requirement for Vepco to provide status reports on progress of 
construction of interconnection facilities.

2.5.2 (maybe)  Agreement to start work on facilities before all studies 
complete, if generator owner willing to bear risk of extra costs.

2.7.1 Undertaking by Vepco to use reasonable efforts to complete on schedule 
(actually, if 4.2.2 is used, this section probably should not be used.)

3.11.3 (last sentence)  Vepco liable for costs for modifications to 
generator-owned interconnection facilities and the Facility if changes 
required because of changes to Vepco facilities (unless required by law).

4.1 Vepco must inform generator owner if costs exceed estimate by more than 
10% and such increase is subject to generator owner's consent.

4.2.2 Concept that Vepco must seek bids for the work and generator owner can 
choose whether the work is done with best efforts undertaking to complete on 
time, but no penalties/incentives or with firm completion date and 
penalties/incentives.

4.3  Generator owner to provide letter of credit for cost of work or 
guarantee (as opposed to 50% paid in advance, as provided in Vepco's draft.  
By the way, even if we agreed to pay 50% in advance, it should not be on 
signing the agreement, but rather before they start the work.)

4.8.1  Refund if Vepco receives money back.

4.9.1  Language re tax gross up (in lieu of the last sentence in their 
Section 7.3.)

5.1  Last sentence--add generator owner's schedules and output,etc. being 
confidential.

In addition, there were a few things in the draft I wanted to point out, as 
follows:

In Section 2.2.3 and elsewhere in the agreement, they reserve the right to 
make a unilateral filing with FERC to amend the agreement.  The generator 
owner would have the right to protest the filing, but I want to check with 
our regulatory people as to whether they can waive this right, as I don't 
think it's fair for them to unilaterally amend it.

Article 4.6 should be reviewed by technical folks.

In Section 10.2.1.3, they reserve the right to file the agreement with FERC 
even if the parties haven't agreed and executed it yet and they start service 
under the agreement.  As noted above, it's putting your fate in FERC's hands.

The indemnity of Vepco's employees and waiver of the protection of worker's 
comp laws in Section 10.5.1 (and the reciprocal in 10.5.2) seemed strange to 
me and I was wondering if you could run this past your risk management people.

I look forward to discussing this with you further.

I have a pretty cool portable play pen you can have if you want.

This stuff is so much better than it was 20 years ago.  It is amazing how 
things have changed.  

Did you know that they now tell you to have  babies sleep on their backs?  
That is totally different from when Paige was a baby.  It was hard to get 
used to.

Kay

That would be wonderful!  I was looking at those online this weekend.  I used 
play pens all of the time for my children.

Thanks very much.

I have a pretty cool portable play pen you can have if you want.

So have you figured out how to use the portal from home?  I just discovered 
it yesterday (while at the office).

We went to Arlington for my nephew's high school graduation, which was fine.  
Sunday we had dinner with Dan Lyons and spouse, which was wonderful.  
Yesterday I cooked, shopped, and puttered in the yard.  Got the last caladium 
bulbs in the ground.   I like to wait until they are on sale.  The weekend 
just flew by.

"They" say sleeping on backs reducing risks of sudden infant death syndrome.  
Go figure.  At least you can see their beautiful faces while they sleep.

Car seats, strollers and diapers are 100x better now.  Especially the diapers.

Yesterday I had a feeling that your grandbaby is a boy.  Just came to me in 
the kitchen.  I have a 50/50 chance of being right!

When I was in Austin I used an "above the water" pedal kayak.  Talk about 
easy.  Neil is talking about us renting to see what we like best.  The above 
the water is more stable than I expected.  I had assumed that it would be 
tippy, but it really wasn't.  Hope you have high water and not hell next 
weekend.

ckm

25 years ago for me (Shayne is 25 today).  Time files.  She was babysitting 
yesterday and had to take the little girl (3 years old) to the emergency room 
because she stepped on some glass.  Apparently is was not a real big deal, 
but I think it was her first ordeal of the kind.

Re: sleeping on backs, I still don't understand that one.  I always thought 
they were to sleep on their stomachs to avoid choaking if they threw up.

Did you do anything fun this weekend?  We just puttered around the house and 
I worked on PRC's yesterday. Next weekend the kayaks are coming out come hell 
or high water!

Rogelio,

Congratulations.  That is quite an honor.

Dear all,
 
In light of the opening of the energy industry, the Mexican Bar Association 
has been asked by different sectors to create the Energy Law Committee. I am 
pleased to inform you that I have been asked to chair such committee.
 
As part of our endevors, we will be involved in the upcoming reforms to the 
energy industry.
 
Very truly yours,

Kay -- We should check each on a case by case basis.  We probably would be 
better off using any definition from the ILA since it was already found to be 
acceptable by MDEA unless there is simply a better definition in the ESMA or 
some inherent conflict or gap relative to the scope of the overall 
agreement.  For any that are not obvious to you, please do not hesitate to 
continue shooting questions at us for clarification.  Should we look at 
Ancillary Services?   Thanks -- David

What is your preference when there is a  conflict between the interim 
agreement and the last draft (v23) of the ESMA.  (For instance, the 
definition of ancillary services.)  Shall I just ignore the ILA, or does it 
represent the customers' expectations?

Kay

I have a note on my calendar that Michael has an appt with SS today.  Has it 
been cancelled?

I'm available any time Friday, and tomorrow afternoon is fine, especially 
after 230.

Kay

Fred / Kay:

I spoke to Duran this morning, and he and I would like to meet together with 
us to discuss the Midway project and whether or not we will be able to 
utilize TurboPark Phase 2. I previously told him that because of timing 
considerations and because there may be certain agreements that will be 
difficult to make TurboPark compliant (such as the attached interconnect 
agreement from FPL), that Phase 2 may not be practical for purposes of this 
project.

I think this would be a good discussion to have on Friday, because we should 
have more information on the GE7FAs and should have already spoken with TECO 
on their proposed MOU (and maybe even the tolling agreement). What are your 
schedules on Friday?

I also would like to schedule a call for tomorrow with TECO to go over the 
MOU. Fred - Please coordinate with Kay and schedule something with Becky 
Alex. I would prefer the afternoon if that's OK with you guys, and would like 
45 min. before the call for us to meet seperately. Also Fred, please advise 
on the status of the tolling agreement.

Kay - attached is FPL's standard form interconnect agreement. I was thinking 
that Carlos would be a good choice to review it as he is currently working 
with accounting / finance on an Ameren interconnect, so he will already be 
familiar with the likely issues. Please let me know what you think. It will 
be important to give Duran a summary of likely accounting / finance issues 
related to this agreement on Friday. 

Hope you both had good weekends. 

Regards,

Ben

I don't know if David Hunt will have comments.  In any event, Marvin, Bob and 
the MDEA rep needs to reveiw it.  

Reagan has my current requests.

Kay -- Do you know if David H. is going to give you comments?  If you haven't 
heard for sure, one of us will call Marvin and find out/coordinate.  Just 
don't want to call if this has already been discussed with them.

Is there anything else at this stage that we can do to help your efforts on 
the Extension or the main agreement?

I'm thinking my last email was unclear.  

I assume that someone from the commercial team will send (or has sent) the 
extension letter to MDEA, YC, and Clarksdale's commercial reps for their 
review.  I assume that the  commercial reps with YC, MDEA, and Clarksdale 
will get whatever legal input they want from their own lawyers if they think 
it is necessary (may not), but as a courtesy, I sent drafts to the two 
lawyers I know about.

Hi Nancy,

I am planning to make the changes which arose out of our meeting with VEPCO.  
When we met with them, we agreed that we would accept all the changes in this 
draft, then blackline against it.  I tried to do this to this document, then 
realized that this is a compared document as opposed to a draft marked with 
changes.  Can you email me unmarked version which contains all these changes, 
and I'll start from there.

I apologize if I already have the clean draft, but I want to be certain that 
I am working from the correct version.

Thanks,

Kay
Attached is a further revision to the PPA,which, as always, remains subject 
to Enron's further review and comment.  Ignore the fact that the document is 
entitled "clean"; this is a blackline against the August 3 version.

 - CLEANVEP.DOC

Yes, however, I could use an electronic version if one is readily available 
(I have the PDF).

Thanks,

Anytime which works for you is fine, as this is more important than my other 
meeting.

Kay:

My afternoon tomorrow looks full - do you have any time before 2 PM to 
discuss the TECO MOU and have a call with them? I will check their schedules 
as well...

Chris,

The docs you sent me that I asked about are titled: Declaration of Covenants, 
Conditions and Restrictions for Midway Grove, and Articles of Incorporation 
of Midway Grove Property Owners Association, Inc.  I'm a bit unclear as to 
how the attached relate to those docs, but I must confess to having not read 
all of the previously sent documents or the two docs on this email.  It would 
help if you could connect the dots for me.

Thanks,

Kay

Attached for your review please find one (1) copy of the title and
survey issues memo I have prepared, which sets forth certain title and
survey issues related to the St. Lucie County site, and also sets forth
what work, if any, we are undertaking to resolve the issues.  In
addition, attached for your review please find one (1) copy of the
initial draft of the title and survey objection letter for the St. Lucie
County site.  The issues set forth in the memo and letter are relatively
minor in nature, as our review of the title and survey documents did not
reveal any issues of which were particularly unusual.  With respect to
the financing issues as they relate to the attached documents, I am not
at all certain whether they have been evaluated from this perspective,
and I am also not certain if they have any impact at all on said issues.

Once you have had an opportunity to review the attachments, please call
me with any questions or comments you may have.  Once the objection
letter is in final form, I will forward same to the optionor.

Best regards,

Chris Boehler

Please email me a brief overview of what these documents are, how they
fit
into the overall picture, and the issues which need the most scrutiny.
Additionally, have these been evaluated in light of Enron's balance
sheet
and financing issues?

for calendar, especially 930

TECO has asked that we schedule our call for tomorrow at 10:30 AM. Kay, I 
would like to meet with you at 9:30 to discuss the MOU. I don't believe their 
counsel will be on the call at 10:30, therefore your participation is 
optional (although you know we'd always prefer to have you).

Quien es mas macho?

You'll also be even more proud to know the outcome of the following text that 
I sent to one of my Mexico clients -- "Matthew, with all due respect, clients 
will be doing business with Enron as it is indentified in the introductory 
paragraph and the signature block.  Indeed, as a side note, most of  the 
documents that I have drafted or reviewed always use some form of acronym for 
subsequent references to Enron.  I am indifferent, but I know that the reason 
our accounting brethen made that comment, as well as the other comments they 
often make that seem counter-intuitive, is that it facilitates their efforts 
in ensuring that documents reflect off-balance sheet, soft costs related 
rather than on-balance sheet, hard costs.  As such, I would defer to them on 
this issue"  which was in response to "Carlos, with all due respect to our 
Accounting brethren, from a commercial point of view, potential clients don't 
want to do business with EDM, they want to do business with Enron.  So, 
please switch the EDM thing back to Enron and everything will be fine."  
Anyway, I think Herman must have forwarded  copy of those emails to Lisa who 
shared it with Joe Deffner and I happened to run into them outside just now 
and they were both congratulating me for my "toughness".  

By separate email, I'll forward you a redlined form of interconnect agreement 
that we can subsequently discuss.

difficult to make TurboPark compliant (such as the attached interconnect 
agreement from FPL), that Phase 2 may not be practical for purposes of this 
project.

I think this would be a good discussion to have on Friday, because we should 
have more information on the GE7FAs and should have already spoken with TECO 
on their proposed MOU (and maybe even the tolling agreement). What are your 
schedules on Friday?

I also would like to schedule a call for tomorrow with TECO to go over the 
MOU. Fred - Please coordinate with Kay and schedule something with Becky 
Alex. I would prefer the afternoon if that's OK with you guys, and would like 
45 min. before the call for us to meet seperately. Also Fred, please advise 
on the status of the tolling agreement.

Kay - attached is FPL's standard form interconnect agreement. I was thinking 
that Carlos would be a good choice to review it as he is currently working 
with accounting / finance on an Ameren interconnect, so he will already be 
familiar with the likely issues. Please let me know what you think. It will 
be important to give Duran a summary of likely accounting / finance issues 
related to this agreement on Friday. 

Hope you both had good weekends. 

Regards,

Ben

Hi Doug,

I hear you are working on the Midway deal.  Me, too.   I want to go back to 
the restaurant  you suggested with the remarkable decor and wine list (was it 
Burns, something like that?).  

 I look forward to working with you on this one.

Kay

Muchas gracias!

Good question.  I thought he was through with it last week.  I'll check up on 
it.

How's Glenn doing with my binder?  Lots of Midway activity this week.

Thanks,

Kay

Wanna come up?

Allyson,

Thank you for your prompt response.  

Can you describe the process and timing for filing a project update?

Thanks,

Kay

I inadvertently ended the sentence with a comma.  The point I was making was
that if it were necessary to negotiate an additional delivery point, NCNG
would probably demand concessions such as an extension of the contract
period.  Hopefully, since we are only talking about a high pressure tap,
NCNG will have less leverage.

Jeffrey and I did talk about amending the application some time ago;  he
expressed the concern that the description of the generators might be
misleading unless either more or less data were supplied, and he suggested
describing them more generally.  I think he was confortable with the fact
that the CPCN will be reviewed by electrical engineers who understand the
generators described without the elaboration he thought necessary.

One of the problems with amending the application is that you run the risk
that the Commission will adjust the time frames for intervention, etc.,
accordingly.  If you want to revise the description of the equipment, it
would be less dangerous to file a project update.   

Allyson,

Thank you for the email.  It seems to stop in mid sentence, so I was
wondering if maybe something got deleted?

We have an interest in having the application for the CPCN amended to be
less specific on the equipment we will be using.  I believe Jeffrey may
have mentioned this to you before.  We would like to follow up with that
now, unless there is some significant problem with it.

Thank you,

Kay

There would seem to me to be two questions--the threshold one is whether
the
site is within Rocky Mount's service territory.  If it is, then what
obligation does NCNG have with respect to the construction of a delivery
point.  I haven't reviewed the annexation statutes yet, but based on my
initial reading of the Service Area Territory Agreement between Rocky Mount
and NCNG, once annexed the site would come within Rocky Mount's purview to
serve, and, although a "mutually agreeable" delivery point would have to be
negotiated, NCNG would at least have to negotiate that in good faith.

The January 13, 1992 Service Area Territory Agreement gives Rocky Mount the
right to distribute natural gas within the city's incorporated limits as
well as a specified area outside the incorporated limits.   The contract
goes on to provide that should any part of that perimeter be annexed into
the city, "the respective rights of the parties as to service in any such
portion shall be determined by applicable case law and the General Statutes
of North Carolina. . ."  The contract further provides that absent an order
of the NCUC to the contrary, NCNG agrees that Rocky Mount has the right to
serve all end users within the "aforementioned" area--presumably referring
to the annexed area, although the agreement is not a model of clarity.

So, at least based on this language, Rocky Mount's right to serve arguably
tracks its incorporated limits, whatever they might be.  (Jonathan and I
are
looking at annexation law to see what else might be lurking out there).

The 1992 Service agreement provides, In Article IV, provides that points of
devliery for all natural gas purchased or transported under the agreement
with NCNG shall be "at the following locations and other stations added at
mutually agreeable locations in the future. . ." In the Third Amendment to
the Natural Gas Service Agreement, dated March 10, 1997, new language and
delivery points are negotiated upon, but the principle is still included
that  other stations may be added at "mutually agreeable locations in the
future."  The question which then arises is what Rocky Mount would have to
give in exchange.  In the 1997 agreement, Rocky Mount agreed to an
extention
of terms of the of ten years, until December 6,

200 is late enough for anyone to be out.  I'm all for the limo taking people 
home at that time.

I am concerned about Michael AND about imposing on Donnie and Lynn.  Are you 
taking Friday off?

Kay

I called Mikey and asked what was the latest he thought the limo would be
needed. He said 3:30. I asked if 2am worked and he said absolutely. He also
said he didn't think it mattered to Paige if it was an SUV or a standard
limo. So what do you think, SUV or standard limo?

I'm not sure what you mean about how to balance Michael. I know I'm
concerned about him getting up early and wanting to go home. That would not
be a good thing. This party is for and about Paige, and you too. I want the
two of you to be able to share this time with out you being concern about
Michael. I will be in charge of Michael Friday morning. I don't mind sitting
second chair so to speak. What do you think?

SUV for 14.  It is ok with me if we have it until 2.  We need to talk how
to balance Michael, etc.

Please respond to <nmann@erac.com>

working on it now...
Thurs 6/7 6pm to midnight it's looking like...
For an SUV 14 passenger it's going to be about $750.00
For a std 12 passenger limo it's going to be about $590.00
Any thoughts...

A friendly reminder.

If it were me I'd go for the standard limo, mostly because I've never seen 
the other kind.

I'm desperate.  HELP!!!!!!  We have a meeting with Duran et al today, and I 
really wanted to brouse through this before then.

I'm leaving in a couple of minutes.  I just wanted some extra quiet time.

Here are my initial comments:

There's no clear triggering event which would expedite the internal approval 
process.  For instance, paragraph 3 is a current obligation (re 
landscaping).  It would be easier to process this agreement if the 
effectiveness of this agreement commences when we  file for a building 
permit.  I understand that we would have to pay some of this prior to the 
time the permit is issued, but again, magic words help.

Paragraph 6 on right of first refusal for power.  Looks like a free call for 
the next 30 years.  Just want to make sure you've bought in on this.  Other 
than the obvious valuation impact, it could impact a purchaser's ability to 
obtain project financing.

Kay

How do I get on the list for the form?  Could you pretty please check for me?

Thanks,

Kay

This place amazes me!  Thanks for  your help.  I have no patience for it.

We went to Michael's school conference today.  His teacher raved about how 
everyone just loves Michael. He is so sweet.  He is staying with my folks 
this week, and the 3 of us miss him so badly.  I can't wait for him to come 
home.  Neil is going to meet my folks and Michael in Palacios this Friday, 
and spend the weekend there, bringing him home on Sunday.  I've got to take 
Roscoe for his last mange shot, so I'm staying.  Plus, I spent last weekend 
with my folks, and too much exposure doesn't work for us.  I hope to  PURGE 
the house of all the junk I have.  I hope it is raining, because  that is 
great cleaning weather.  I want to see bare space in my closet.  I think I'll 
call the Women's Center and see what type of stuff they need.

I'm planning on taking next Thursday and Friday off.  Next Thursday is 
Paige's 21st birthday, so we have great plans.  Do you know anywhere that can 
enlarge a photo and mount it on a board?

I still get a bill for the card they used previously for my phone.  Go figure.

I need to send off my Tx tax and bar dues today.  I'll want to fed ex, just 
in case you are sending anyone else's today.

Thanks,

I'm still waiting on David Hunt to send me some stuff, which would really 
help move the document along.  I'll ask again if i can get it from him. There 
are still internal questions in it, which I have annotated. I'm happy for you 
to look at it fairly shortly, especially if you can give definitive 
commercial direction.

Do you feel that the commercial team is  finished with the exhibits?  I 
haven't worked on them, but I suspect the exhibits need work.  I know the 
bogey calc doc is a bit rough.

Do you still owe me the emergency transmission cut stuff?

Early next week is better than later, and Thursday and Friday are huge 
problem days for me.  When are you thinking of meeting with Beck?  Anyway to 
combine the two at once, given the short timeframe?

Has Dave signed the extension, by the way?

Kay

Kay,

We are starting to run into some scheduling constraints for next week, at 
least with Bob Priest.  I'd like to get together with Bob and Marvin early 
next week to discuss the agreement--moving toward finalizing before June 12.  
Bob is only available Monday.  Bob and Marvin think it is a good ideal to 
then meet with RW Beck.

I'd like to email Marvin and Bob the next version sometime today?

Lisa - regarding the movement of the turbines out of the WestLB structure 
into a South American power project:

I just got out of a meeting with the SA team doing the Elektrobolt (sp?) 
project development work. That is the "Rio Gen Merchant" project that the 8 
LM6000s are destined for.  Kay Mann (ENA lawyer who worked on the LM6000 
contract with GE), myself, Humberto Cubillos (ENA finance person who works 
with Lisa Bills on the WestLB structure), Kevin Joyce (ESA finance) and 
Herman Manis (ENA structuring accountant) will  need to coordinate any 
movement of turbines out of the WestLB structure.

I can get you electronic copies of both the MHI and S&S (LM6000) contracts, 
but would appreciate your coordinating with Kay, myself or Humberto before 
advising the developers as to any of the details of the move out of the S&S 
structure.  Kevin Joyce or myself should be contacted before advising the 
developers on the MHI structure.

Thanks,

Rose 

It should be signed and on its way.

I've heard that they are trying to schedule a meeting for Monday, so I'm 
trying to get a draft of the agreement out.  Do you think you will have a 
chance to send me the preamble stuff?  I know it doesn't seem like a big 
deal, but I will feel better if I understand who's on first, so to speak/

Thanks,

Kay

Kay:  I have O.K.ed the extension letter and advised Marvin of my approval.
He will get it authorized by the Commission.

I've taken the liberty of drafting a form of extension letter to extend the
ILA until June 15.

I suspect Reagan will be distributing to the commercial folks, but I
thought I would give you a heads up.

David, I'm at work on revising the longer term doc.  If you have your
preamble stuff ready, I'm happy to put it in now.

Thanks,

Kay

PS  The salutation is to "Gentlemen".  Are the members of the commission
and MDEA all men?  I don't want to commit a blunder.

That reminds me.  There used to be a "gift department" that blessed such 
things.  I don't remember where it is - PR?  I wonder who would know?  

I can't wait to use the "baby Carnahan" things!  It makes me excited just to 
think about it.  And funny you would mention the last name thing because I 
was just thinking about that last night.  The father's name is Dustin Elkins, 
but I doubt they will get married (at least Shayne has not indicated that 
they were).  Kayne reminds me of my niece and nephew's names (Kade and Konner 
Carnahan).  

I just talked to Carlos.  He is already in Colorado and in the process of 
renting a car.  I told him about the gift thing and he does not think it 
would be a problem.  The deal is, that the Indian Chief that Matt Gimble has 
been dealing with was ousted and so Matt, et al. want to give the "new" Chief 
a saddle and maybe a fishing real.  They also want to give the 4 tribal 
counsel and their attorney pen & pencil sets and shirts.

Anyway, Carlos did not think it would be a problem but asked me to double 
check with Andy Edison just in case.

How embarrassing to be stripped of chiefhood!  I'll bet ole' Chief Sitting

How cool is that.

Most of the gifts will be coming from that little department (even the 
fishing reel has the Enron logo on it).  The only thing that is logo-less is 
the saddle, and our developers would like to find someone to tool the Logo on 
it.

Hi Kathy,

I'm in the office today, if you want to finish up ABB.  Ben Jacoby and Jody 
Pierce will need copies, if you will be making copies for distribution.

We can talk about the LM6000 change order #2, also.

Thanks,

Kay

yes, thanks

Kay, I called Cingular to see what was up with your bill.  The last payment 
was made the end of March.  Your credit card expired March, 2001.  So, you 
are not set up currently for your credit card to be charged.  I'm going to go 
ahead and expense this charge and then you'll need to pay it.  If you want it 
set up again on your credit card, you have to send Cingular a letter stating 
your wishes.

I also changed your address to this building while I had her on the phone.

Is all of this ok with you?>

Yes, I'm officially in Elizabeth's group.  I need to ask her for a flat 
screen monitor.

Ok, sending it in now.  Have you officially been changed to Elizabeth's cost 
center?  You aren't in Jeff's time site any more.  I want to make sure I send 
it to the correct person.

I just like to make Margie work.

So do you think they'll fire Dierker?  I guess you heard Lima is heading to 
the bullpen.

Will do.  For the moment, the only document that is outstanding is the joint
letter instruction to Citibank regarding the disbursement of the escrow
funds.  I have a template, but I'll go ahead and let them take the lead.

MIR

If there are any other resolutions, etc that they want, I would let them
prepare them.

You know ES doesn't work Fridays, so that takes away one day of opportunity 
to approve them, plus she hasn't had an assistant.  Maybe things will 
improve.  She is very excited about her new assistant.

I see that.  She's not real fast on approving things either.  I've submitted 
your expense report and Carol's to her.  She hasn't gotten to Carol's yet, 
and I did it a few days ago.  Haedicke isn't that fast either.  I don't think 
they like all this automation, but it really makes it so much quicker.  I'm 
going to be the queen at invoices and expense reports because I do so many of

Here's where I am.  I haven't finished all of your changes.  Please look for

looking for your confirmation.

Good afternoon,

I am circulating a draft of the long term agreement for your review. There 
are still holes, but hopefully it sets out the basic commercial deal. 

Please note that  we are anticipating a Monday meeting.  Therefore, we have 
sent this out without the usual internal review.

We hope to have a set of exhibits shortly.

Talk to you soon,

Kay

FYI, tomorrow I should receive turbine contracts for the 3 GE 7FAs being sold 
by Site. Please see the e-mail below from Sithe's advisor regarding the 
transaction schedule. Kay and I plan to initially review the contract, and I 
have a technical team (Booth / Rose) ready to review the contracts as well.

From an accounting / finance perspective, I am interested in how we should 
proceed given the circumstances. Kay and my initial plan is to review the 
contracts from a technical / legal / commercial perspective and submit a 
revised indicative number by Tuesday in consultation with Duran. Between now 
and then, it would be helpful to know from accounting / finance how we should 
proceed given that we are in a bidding situation (with I'm told three other 
bidders). Herman / Rose / Lisa - please let me know your thoughts on this.

Chip - I would like Chris Booth to work with you on putting a draft DASH 
together.

In the meantime, I will forward turbine contracts to everyone as soon as I 
receive them.

Regards,

Ben 

Ben:

Per our conversation today, the turbine contract and LTSA are being sent
via Fed Ex to your office in Houston.

Final bids are due next Tuesday, June 5th via fax to 781-270-0055.  Bids
should include best price and a closing schedule (date by which bidder will
have all internal approvals necessary to enter into a binding agreement
with Seller subject only to consent from GE).

Thanks again for you patience and please call me if you have any questions,

Hi Greg,

I just wanted to mention that if we are going to bust the percentage rule on 
the option payment, there is no incremental damage in having the option 
payment credited to the purchase price of the land.

As for officers of the development company, I would use Dave Duran.  Ben 
holds a power of attorney, but isn't an officer.

Hope you get email!

Kay

Gentlemen,

I thought I would pull together a brief email outlining where we are on 
certain tasks.  Here goes:

Hub Agency Agreement - Gregg recently met with Peoples to discuss some of the 
outstanding commercial issues relating to the Hub Agency Agreement.  Roy is 
putting together a summary of the outcome of that meeting.  Gregg and I 
decided it would be better to not send Peoples the current draft of the 
agreement which has been circulated internally, but instead will send a draft 
which incorporates the outcome of these discussions.

Memo regarding restricted activities - David has prepared a draft for Enron's 
review.  Here's the draft:

Gregg and I need to review it.

Gregg and Peoples have been working on the grandfathered transaction list.  
Since both sides are running behind on this,  David prepared a very straight 
forward amenment to the LLC agreement, exending the time frame for finishing 
the task.  Here it is:
 

Policies - Gregg "Policy Man" Penman has been working on a credit policy, 
cash management policy, risk management policy, and probably a couple of 
others I'm forgetting.

Revolving line of credit - Gregg has been working the internal Enron system 
to get approval for a $50mm line of credit for MEH.  He has raised the issue 
of Peoples needing to provide a guarantee for their half.  Also, it may be 
necessary or advisable to document that the line of credit will be paid 
before any distributions are made to either member.  This is still under 
internal review at Enron.  I will check around to see if Corp (the lender) 
has a form of credit facility we should use.

Miscellaneous:
Decide about services agreement
Confidentiality agreements 
Transfer pricing documentation
Other agreements (ISDA, GISB, Peaking Agency, Third Party Master)
Board resolution appointing officers/managers
Budget and marketing plan 
Other administrative functions (per Gregg's Business Setup Items list)

Hope this is helpful.

Kay

Hello.

The commercial team  has asked that I forward this document to you for 
review.  It is a development agreement for a project in Florida.  We have 
attempted to address the accounting/E-Next issues, but please advise of any 
desired changes.

Thank you,

Kay

PS  Pardon the formatting.  It will be cleaned up by those with the ability 
to do so.

Hi there.

Is the site plan approval a different document than the development order?

Thanks,

Kay

Please calendar for me.
 On Tuesday June 5th in room 3125B from 4:00 - 5:00 P.M.,  we will be having 
a presentation on the MDEA delphi application and website that will help 
consolidate our procedures.  We will also have a happy hour from 5-8 p.m. at 
the Front Porch Pub.

Thanks

I give up.  How in the world did you jump to that crazy conclusion?

Oh, I know she is excited about her new assistant.  I thought she was going 
to get up and dance about her.

Does this mean you gave me a bad review?

hey, you're on vacation.  NO WORKING 

I think Ben's time frame is realistic. I assume we will enter into an 
assignment and assumption agreement with Sithe, to which GE will consent. In 
addition, we may need an override letter to the turbine contract to address 
the E-Next/accounting issues. GE is familiar with what we need in for E-Next, 
which should help expedite matters.  

Kay

I've been told that we need to resubmit a non-binding expression of interest 
by Tuesday. Previously, we submitted a one page non-binding letter indicating 
that the FMV of the units is $44 MM each. You raise a good point in that we 
should be prepared to say (again, on a non-binding basis) how long we will 
need to close (in addition to increasing the bid on the units). I think if 
our number is good, 30 - 45 days for documentation and close would work, but 
I think we should also be willing to post some non-refundable $s within say, 
2 weeks on the basis of an exclusivity agreement with Sithe. 

The group's thoughts on this would be appreciated.

Thanks.

What is expected for the Tuesday bid? I would guess the most critical from a 
timing perspective will be a response centered on price and 
commercial/technical issues. Michael indicates below he would like a 
timetable for internal approvals to a closing. Do we have any indication how 
pressed he is to close and fund versus agreeing on economic terms quickly and 
allowing us to review the form of contract to ensure compliance with 
accounting and finance guidlelines along the lines of our discussion earlier 
this week? Thanks.

Hi there,

Could you please print these for me?  Thanks.

FYI: I'm going to antitrust training from 230 to 430.  Bet you are jealous. 

Kay
	
	

FYI -- Here is the e-mail we discussed regarding the most current versions of 
each policy.

Gregg
	
	

Welcome back.  I am sure you have been looking forward to getting all these 
documents, so here they are.  Attached are the following:

1)

Current draft of the MEH Risk Policy.  Kay, Mary and I have discussed the 
current draft line by line and are at the point where your review is needed 
to proceed.  Vlady has reviewed the current draft and has no significant 
changes.  

2)

Current draft of the Risk Procedures and Control Guidelines and accompanying 
flowcharts.  Brent Price and his team have reviewed the Procedures and have 
provided revisions where appropriate.  Linda and Mary have also provided 
input which has been incorporated.  I need to circulate the draft to all 
parties one more time to make sure everyone is comfortable with the last 
updates and that there are no inconsistencies.

3)

Current draft of the credit policy as last revised by Aparna.  The draft was 
sent last night to Molly Harris at Enron for her review and I am currently 
waiting to hear from her.  If there are any changes to this draft I will 
notify you promptly and forward the newest draft.

4)
Current draft of the proposed cash management policy.  Jim Burns has reviewed 
the proposed cash management policy and is in general agreement with the 
procedures.  We will be drafting a Facility Agreement shortly which will 
cover the specifics of the Enron Revolver to MEH.

As for reports and a general understanding of limit development, modeling, 
stress testing, etc., there have been several meetings over the last week.  
Brent Price and his team were in Chicago last week to go over the daily 
reports with Linda, Tim, Maria, Kay and Mary and discuss the development of 
the Daily Position Report (DPR). To my knowledge, the only outstanding report 
is the DPR.  The DPR you received on Tuesday was not an MEH only DPR and was 
not scrubbed before it was sent out.  It was intended to show the format, but 
they inadvertently pulled numbers into it.  I am expecting that a scrubbed 
DPR will be sent out end of this week (Since the EMW and MEH books are 
currently "flat", the DPR will not show any open positions or VAR - we can 
discuss in more detail if you want).  Regarding risk management 
methodologies, Mary has had discussions with Vlady and our research staff and 
I have received positive feedback regarding the sharing of information.  

I realize this is a large amount of information to digest, but I would like 
to get together as soon as you have a chance to review the policies and talk 
to Mary, Kay, Linda, etc. in order to come up with a list of any remaining 
issues.  I acknowledge that this should and will be a evolutionary process, 
but I also want to have a clear direction of what is necessary to approve the 
policies.   Just let me know when you are available and I will make myself 
available.

Thanks,

Gregg

Mark Haedicke approved the hiring of King & Spalding for this matter.  I will 
drop Mr. Derrick a voice mail, but I would faint if he objected.

John, we need to talk about the sale of the LLC, and the generation of a 
draft doc re same.  Please let me know if you are available today to discuss 
this transaction with Sr. Jacoby and me.  Additionally, it would be helpful 
to discuss the tolling arrangement with Ken.

Thanks,

Kay

I haven't heard anything from David or Scott.  Have you heard anything from 
Marvin or Bob?  Is there a meeting confirmed for Monday?

I'm on another conference call re landfill.  Yikes.

Kay

Elizabeth,

I would like to have a flat screen monitor, if possible.

Thank you,

Kay

Well, let's try someplace else.  What can you think of in walking distance?  
It is a lunch for a new lawyer in our group.

Kay

The only thing they had at noon today was in smoking.   I went ahead and put 
you down since the next non-smoking reservation was at 12:45.  Let me know if 
you want it changed.

Attached are my comments on the Midway LOI.

FYI, Duran and I spoke to Mike Carlson of TECO regarding Ft. Pierce. Dave 
really wants us to push to get something done on that project. It would be 
similarly styled to our Midway - TECO discussions (ENA sells the dev, asset 
and takes back a 5 year toll). 

Mike Carlson said he would get his lawyer to generate a LOI on Ft.Pierce, but 
I think we need to get them comments back on Midway to expedite this.

Kay - have you had any luck engaging King & Spaulding on these deals?

Let's talk about these comments at your earliest convenience.

Fred - we need the term sheet on the toll, and the toll price refreshed by 
the desk, as soon as possible.

Thanks,

Ben

Ben,

I made a minor adjustment to the LOI re: exclusivity.    

Policy states that any time we sign up to exclusivity we are supposed to get 
it approved by Mark Metts, Tim Detmering and the CEO of the affected business 
unit.  Seems a little silly in this case, but it can't hurt. (yes, I know we 
didn't do it with the turbine stuff)

Kay   

You are referring to the purchase and sale agreement, right?  I'm not asking 
him to do anything on the LOI.

I haven't spoken to him in person.  I'll address it when we connect.  Are you 
available this afternoon to talk to him with me?

Kay

Have we asked John to turn this around by Monday?

Ben,

I made a minor adjustment to the LOI re: exclusivity.    

 << File: Midway TECO LOI june 1.doc >>

Kay   

I don't believe we need Keffer's input to process the LOI.  I can have their 
power guy look at the term sheet if we think we are done with it.

Kay:

I will review your comments on the LOI.  I wanted to check with make sure 
that someone at King & Spalding is reviewing the Midway term sheet along with 
the LOI, so that we can send the term sheet to TECO on Monday/Tuesday.

Let me know.

FYI.  Please read.
We have several other Florida opportunities that are at about a 50% 
probability (Corbett, Deerfield, Pompano, and South Dade). We also have 
projects in Goergia (Hartwell and Athens) that are probably 70%, and 
Louisiana (Calcasieu and St Charles) that are 50%. I would put Midway at 90%. 
The non-Florida opportunities would be used to package with the turbines and 
flip a la Pastoria. We have strong interest in Georgia in particular, and 
have received a written offer from FPL to purchase the development assets of 
Hartwell and Athens for $4.4 million (no equip. included).

I would presume we would put the turbines back on the market in Q1 of '02 if 
we do not proceed with any Florida opportunities. I think the downside is 
approximately $2 million per unit (given that that is our effective premium 
being offered today), but that we have a natural hedge on this downside as we 
have a high chance of recouping any downside by combining the turbines with 
any of the development assets listed above (they have all been permitted for 
7FAs, although not all permits have been received).

We need to know how probable the other projects are; at what point do we 
propose to put the turbines back on the market for re-sale; and what is our 
best estimate of the potential downside upon re-sale.

I think we decided to take the turbine purchase approval route, and describe 
the several projects (Midway et al) that we can match the turbines with. Are 
you still OK with that?

Depending upon the route we take for approval (turbine purchase vs. project 
approval), the DASH process should take no more than 5 to 10 days.  How firm 
are we on the Midway project?

I think Ben's time frame is realistic. I assume we will enter into an 
assignment and assumption agreement with Sithe, to which GE will consent. In 
addition, we may need an override letter to the turbine contract to address 
the E-Next/accounting issues. GE is familiar with what we need in for E-Next, 
which should help expedite matters.  

Kay

I've been told that we need to resubmit a non-binding expression of interest 
by Tuesday. Previously, we submitted a one page non-binding letter indicating 
that the FMV of the units is $44 MM each. You raise a good point in that we 
should be prepared to say (again, on a non-binding basis) how long we will 
need to close (in addition to increasing the bid on the units). I think if 
our number is good, 30 - 45 days for documentation and close would work, but 
I think we should also be willing to post some non-refundable $s within say, 
2 weeks on the basis of an exclusivity agreement with Sithe. 

The group's thoughts on this would be appreciated.

Thanks.

What is expected for the Tuesday bid? I would guess the most critical from a 
timing perspective will be a response centered on price and 
commercial/technical issues. Michael indicates below he would like a 
timetable for internal approvals to a closing. Do we have any indication how 
pressed he is to close and fund versus agreeing on economic terms quickly and 
allowing us to review the form of contract to ensure compliance with 
accounting and finance guidlelines along the lines of our discussion earlier 
this week? Thanks.

All:

FYI, tomorrow I should receive turbine contracts for the 3 GE 7FAs being sold 
by Site. Please see the e-mail below from Sithe's advisor regarding the 
transaction schedule. Kay and I plan to initially review the contract, and I 
have a technical team (Booth / Rose) ready to review the contracts as well.

From an accounting / finance perspective, I am interested in how we should 
proceed given the circumstances. Kay and my initial plan is to review the 
contracts from a technical / legal / commercial perspective and submit a 
revised indicative number by Tuesday in consultation with Duran. Between now 
and then, it would be helpful to know from accounting / finance how we should 
proceed given that we are in a bidding situation (with I'm told three other 
bidders). Herman / Rose / Lisa - please let me know your thoughts on this.

Chip - I would like Chris Booth to work with you on putting a draft DASH 
together.

In the meantime, I will forward turbine contracts to everyone as soon as I 
receive them.

Regards,

Ben 

Ben:

Per our conversation today, the turbine contract and LTSA are being sent
via Fed Ex to your office in Houston.

Final bids are due next Tuesday, June 5th via fax to 781-270-0055.  Bids
should include best price and a closing schedule (date by which bidder will
have all internal approvals necessary to enter into a binding agreement
with Seller subject only to consent from GE).

Thanks again for you patience and please call me if you have any questions,

revised.  Hope it is helpful.

Attached is a further revision to the PPA,which, as always, remains subject 
to Enron's further review and comment.  Ignore the fact that the document is 
entitled "clean"; this is a blackline against the August 3 version.

Enron Golfers:

Hey guys, Sarah Edwards is a friend of a friend's daughter who desperately 
needs help to stay alive and all you duffers out there can help:

The 100 holes for golf for Sarah Edwards will be Monday June 4 at
Sweetwater CC. Sarah needs a lung transplant and
approximately $150,000 of the costs are not covered by insurance or
medicaid.  

For more info on Sarah, visit Sarahssoldiers.com 

Here is how the 100 holes for golf works:

*Free golf at Sweetwater
*You play as many holes as you can (100 is not mandatory)
* We provide your lunch, drinks and snacks
* You get pledges from your friends to play
*pledges may be flat amounts, per hole, per birdie or per eagle

Lets all keep Sarah alive! Can I get some other tentative commitments?

thanks!

Enron is trying to buy some GE turbines to use in projects.

FYI and Ken's review (no offense, John).
Attached is the draft term sheet for the Midway toll.  I have pulled in the 
language from the earlier draft and incorporated Black Hills language where 
applicable. I have left the pricing blank for now, subject to a refresh from 
structuring.

Let's discuss sometime tomorrow.

Fred

Good luck!

Thanks for your support.  We checked into the matching, but unfortunately 
since the group raising this money was not formed as a Charitable 
Organization under the tax reg's, the ability to get Enron to match is not 
availible.  The goal of each golfer is to raise at least $1000 towards the 
$150K goal, and your donation puts me over the $1K bar.

Thanks again.

Fred

Hello.

The commercial team  has asked that I forward this document to you for 
review.  It is a development agreement for a project in Florida.  We have 
attempted to address the accounting/E-Next issues, but please advise of any 
desired changes.

Thank you,

Kay

PS  Pardon the formatting.  It will be cleaned up by those with the ability 
to do so.

As requested, here is the current draft of the Midway LOI.  The counter party 
has not seen this draft yet, so this is still preliminary.

I'm reviewing the term sheet re toll.

Kay

David,

Do you know if we are meeting on Monday?  I haven't heard the final word.

Sent by: Enron Announcements
 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

another puzzle piece
We are pleased to announce organizational changes to the Enron South America 
legal department in response to the recent reorganization and realignment of 
the principal Enron Wholesale Services business units operating in the 
region, Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets. 

Randy Young, currently General Counsel of ESA, will be assuming new 
responsibilities within Enron.  John Novak will become General Counsel of 
ESA, reporting to Mark Haedicke.  The ESA legal department will be 
responsible for supporting all Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets 
businesses in the region.  Additional legal resources, coordinated by Lance 
Schuler, will be provided from EWS Legal in Houston to support ESA's 
wholesale activities.  John will also work closely with Bruce Lundstrom, 
General Counsel of EGA, to coordinate legal support with respect to the EGA 
businesses in the region.  An organizational chart describing the new 
structure is attached.

This new structure will enable us to continue to provide quality legal 
support across business lines within South America while improving 
coordination and providing additional support from Houston for Enron's 
existing operating businesses, as well as the new business development 
initiatives under way in the region.

I'm sorry. TECO and Ft. Pierce Utility Authority.

I need the name of the other party involved in Ft Pierce so that John can

Can we assume this will also cover Ft. Pierce?

Mark Haedicke approved the hiring of King & Spalding for this matter.  I will

John, we need to talk about the sale of the LLC, and the generation of a

to discuss the tolling arrangement with Ken.

Do you want to send the LOI to TECO, or should I?

I don't believe we need Keffer's input to process the LOI.  I can have their

Kay:

I will review your comments on the LOI.  I wanted to check with make sure

the LOI, so that we can send the term sheet to TECO on Monday/Tuesday.

I made a minor adjustment to the LOI re: exclusivity.

Policy states that any time we sign up to exclusivity we are supposed to get

unit.  Seems a little silly in this case, but it can't hurt. (yes, I know we 
didn't do it with the turbine stuff)

David,

How about 400 this afternoon? I have another call at 230, but it should be 
over by then.

Kay
	
	

Kay - attached is Roy's writeup on our Hub Agency discussion last week.  Let 
me know what your schedule looks like today.  If you have time, I would like 
to go through this with you and David to get your thoughts and kick-off the 
drafting.  

Thanks,

Gregg

I'll be there, too.

I believe so! I have it on my calendar at 11:00 a.m.

David,

Do you know if we are meeting on Monday?  I haven't heard the final word.

Hi there.

Is the site plan approval a different document than the development order?

Thanks,

Kay

I can't find any call in info for the conference call on Monday.  I may  be 
reachable on 713 304 8716, or maybe someone could leave me a voice mail 
message at the office if there is a dial in number.

Thanks,

Took about  8 months.  A new record.

Don't faint, but I am holding the original fully executed CA's for enovate 
and Peoples (sent by Gregg Penman).  Whew, those took a really long time

I was in Clarksdale yesterday, and have a dr's appt this am, but will be glad 
to give you what I have.  In fact, I could use some help with the EEI if the 
offer is still good.  Maybe you could just talk me through it.

Thanks,

Kay -- Could you forward me e-versions of (1) the completed one month 
Clarksdale transaction, (2) the draft transaction document you feel is the 
best template from the point of view of the seller of the marketing services 
and (3) the finalized term sheet, if there was one, before the parties 
started to work on the definitive agreement relating to Clarksdale?  My 
'Virginia garbage burners' transaction has awakened, with negotiations 
occurring tomorrow.  Thanks, David

Wilson,

We are trying to finalize this transaction by next Tuesday, and I could 
really use your help.  I believe you owe me a draft of an opinion letter?  
Also, do you have any comments to the draft agreement I sent out last week?

I also need an opinion that the language in the agreement re the Cities 
obligation to financially support MDEA is sufficient.

Thank you,

Kay

Just a reminder that I have a drs appt this am.  Nothing special, just one 
very overdue check up.

Kay

Very good.  

I was in Miss yesterday and have a doctor's appt this am.  I'll call later.

Kay

Kay-we have no conflict with Ft. Pierce Utility Authority

I'm sorry. TECO and Ft. Pierce Utility Authority.

    -----Original Message-----
     I need the name of the other party involved in Ft Pierce so that John
     can clear conflicts.

     Subject:  RE: Midway

     Can we assume this will also cover Ft. Pierce?

         -----Original Message-----
        Mark Haedicke approved the hiring of King & Spalding for this
        matter.  I will drop Mr. Derrick a voice mail, but I would faint if
        he objected.

        John, we need to talk about the sale of the LLC, and the generation
        of a draft doc re same.  Please let me know if you are available
        today to discuss this transaction with Sr. Jacoby and me.
        Additionally, it would be helpful to discuss the tolling
        arrangement with Ken.

        Thanks,

        Kay

Rob made some changes in the e-mail I sent last Friday.  He put the info 
about the Assignment and Assumption Agreement in para. 2 and used more 
defined terms from the ADA.

I think we can use the same A&A agreement to notify WestLB of our intent to 
assign the P.O. and give notice as to the closing date.  However, the current 
form of A&A agreement has sig. blocks for only ENA and WestLB.  Seems like 
you need a sig. for the assuming party!  Particularly since that party is 
purporting to give notice to WestLB of its intent to pay the purchase price!

Rose

To effectuate the movement of turbines out of the WestLB LM6000 structures 
the following needs to take place:

1) ADA - Assignment of the Purchase Option.  On at least 5 (five) days notice 
to WestLB, ENA will assign the Purchase Option for the subject equipment and 
ancillary agreement to the purchasing entity.  This assignment (the 
"Assignment")  must release the Lessor (WestLB)  from all its obligations 
under the Turbine Purchase Agreement with respect to the subject equipment 
and ancillary agreements.  This means that GE Packaged Power (a division of 
GE) and other vendors must release WestLB from its obligations with respect 
to the subject equipment and contracts.  (Kay - Could this be done by an 
amendment to the scheduled equipment under the various agreements between 
WestLB and the various vendors? Rose - I believe so, along with entering into 
the new contracts reference in 3))  

The assignment agreement to effect this is explained below and can be 
prepared by Kay, Rose or Rob.

2) ADA - Closing of the Purchase Option.  WestLB requires at least 5 (five) 
days written notice of the exercise of the purchase option and  this notice 
can be included in the Assignment and Assumption Agreement.   The purchase 
price for the subject equipment and agreements will be the "Termination 
Amount" as defined in the ADA, as allocable to the subject equipment and 
contracts.  This amount is equal to the sum of i) the aggregate outstanding 
amount of the Advances, plus ii) any Transaction Expenses then due and owing. 
plus iii) all accrued amounts due on any Lessor Yield or Facility Fee, plus 
iv) any amounts owed for any costs reasonably incurred by the Lessor with 
respect to the subject equipment and contracts.  The particular amounts of 
the foregoing costs and fees allocable to the subject equipment and contracts 
should be determined in coordination with Lisa Bills and Humberto Cubillos.

The Assignment and Assumption Agreement  used to consummate the Purchase 
Option is attached as Exhibit G to the ADA and can be prepared by Kay, Rose 
or Rob.  It needs to be executed by ENA, ENA's Designee as assignee and 
WestLB.  A detailed list of the equipment and contracts being assigned must 
be prepared by the assignee and attached to the assignment. 

3) Assignment under the Turbine Purchase Agreement.  The Purchaser (WestLB) 
under the Turbine Purchase Agreement (the "Turbine Contract") may assign a 
portion of its rights and obligations under the Turbine Contract to an 
affiliate of ENA without the Seller's consent.  Kay has structured the 
Turbine Contract to allow the assignee to enter into separate purchase 
agreements with GE Packaged Power for the equipment being assigned.   The 
documents to transfer title of the equipment from WestLB (in the case of 
equipment that is already fabricated) and  to replace ENA with another 
business unit on the purchase agreement should be prepared by the business 
unit attorneys involved in the transfer, based on a form of contract which is 
very similiar to the Master Purchase Agreement. (Rose - the assignee/new 
owner needs to step into the turbine contract even if title has  passed to 
WestLB, as there are lots of rights (warranty, indemnity) the new owner needs 
to have.  It seems to me that you would transfer title in the assignment, 
then step into the remainder of the other rights in the new contract - a/k/a 
facility agreement.  Then you delete the assigned equipment from the Master 
Agreement.)

 The tax specialists from both ENA and the acquiring business units should be 
advised as to the planned date of title transfer.  

 Same generally holds true for the ABB transformers, except that the 
assignment to an Enron SPV may require a form of security.  

I go back for more tests this afternoon.

What did the doc say?  Are you ok?

Thanks for the info.  Rest well.  

Is this for the escrow or other docs?  I know Citibank does not require a 
corporate seal.  What BS!

Kathleen is out sick, so it will be a day or two.

Kay

Kathleen:

Paul Hastings would like ENA to resign the Incumbency Certificate, since the
original Certificate did not affix the corporate seal.  Could you coordinate
this and make sure the seal is affixed to the new Certificate?  Thanks.

Call me if you have any questions.

Regards,

Marisa

Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think we've done that on the other two deals.  
Kathleen would know.

For the escrow.  Unfortunately, Citibank's form contained the following
language in the signature block: "In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my
hand and affixed the corporate seal of the Company this ______ day of May,
2001."

Is this for the escrow or other docs?  I know Citibank does not require a
corporate seal.  What BS!

Kathleen is out sick, so it will be a day or two.

Kay

Kathleen:

Paul Hastings would like ENA to resign the Incumbency Certificate, since
the
original Certificate did not affix the corporate seal.  Could you
coordinate
this and make sure the seal is affixed to the new Certificate?  Thanks.

Call me if you have any questions.

Regards,

Marisa

For something that doesn't matter, it seems to matter.  I wonder how well the

Are they squirming yet?

I still hold the originals in my hands pending your instructions.

Kay,

A few weeks ago I spoke with John Keffer regarding Sweetgum Energy LLC's
request that Ben Jacoby sign unanimous resolutions of CAED I & II approving
the sale by CAED I and II of their respective GE turbines to Sweetgum.  As
of today, Sweetgum has not received back the resolutions signed by Ben. As I
explained to John, Sweetgum and InterGen would appreciate Ben's prompt
execution and return of the resolutions.  If Enron does not wish for Ben to
sign the resolutions, then Sweetgum and InterGen would appreciate your
advising us of that as soon as possible.

As I explained to John, Sweetgum would like to have unanimous resolutions as
this is more customary and cleaner, however, since Ben received the required
3 business days prior notice of the proposed resolutions, the resolutions
only need the majority approval of the board members.

I would appreciate hearing back from you at your earliest convenience.

Ben,

If Christi has reviewed an interconnect agreement, I ususally don't have 
outside counsel review it unless there is a specific reason. She's the queen 
of interconnects.

I suppose that after I review it, next stop is Finance/Accounting.

Carlos has given me a couple of comments.

It is Father's Day and we will do what you want. If you want to go there, 
that's great.  I'm happy to tell Tom, his wife and all the world that what we 
do that weekend is 100% up to you.  

It sounds like he has the impression that I'm the hold up.  

Kay

This is for the Father's Day week. I told Tom you were probably going to NY 
for a business trip. I don't see any way around not giving him the home 
number. 
 
Hi Neil;
Tried to get your number at home so Sonja could call Kay to reinforce the 
invite to come to the ranch.  It seems to be unlisted.  If you will send me 
the number I will turn Sonja loose on her.

Wilson,

We are running short on time.  We are planning to sign on  Tuesday, and I 
hesitate to put a new document in front of them at this late date. Would it 
be easier to work with reps/warranties?

I definitely need an answer from your firm confirming (1) enforceability  (2) 
obligation of the Cities to financially support agreement.

Also, could you provide me with the Mississippi law defn of consequential 
damages and a couple of examples where Enron could be responsible for same  
under this agreement?  Also, can MDEA and the Cities be liableto Enron for 
consequentials (absent a waiver)?  

Your comments to the previously forwarded draft would be greatly appreciated.

I had spoken to Rod Clement, one of our opinions guys, about having a call 
with you, but we hadn't gotten around to scheduling it. What is your 
availability this afternoon? Both Rod and I are available.

Wilson,

We are trying to finalize this transaction by next Tuesday, and I could
really use your help.  I believe you owe me a draft of an opinion letter?
Also, do you have any comments to the draft agreement I sent out last week?

I also need an opinion that the language in the agreement re the Cities
obligation to financially support MDEA is sufficient.

Thank you,

Kay

Yes,which is what prompted my email this am. I'm looking for a way to 
simplify the process since closing is less than a week away.

Amazing that they stayed afloat.  50 year history probably helped that 
happen.  Kinda sad, though.  I liked those guys.

I received a fax in yesterday, so I'll review it.

In a seperate e-mail, I sent out the LOI to TECO which incorporated most of 
Fred's comments. On the tolling term sheet, I agree with Fred's comments. Kay 
- where do we stand on having outside counsel review this? I have indicated 
to TECO that we will have a draft tolling term sheet to them by Wednesday. 
Please let me know.

Thanks,

Attached are my comments on the Midway Tolling term sheet and LOI.  

I will be out on Monday but will have my cell phone on.  My conversations 
will be regularly interrupted by golf strokes, but I will do my best to be 
available.

Call me if you have specific questions/issues to discuss.  I have asked Dave 
Kellermeyer to call either one of you on Monday with an answer to the minimum 
block size for the tolling term sheet.  I am taking the air permit home to 
review and will leave you a message if I determine the answer.

Billy, 

It is expected that by the time the hard costs referenced in #2 are incurred, 
the project will be in E Next (or its successor/take out vehicle) since 
construction will be nearly complete.  Costs incurred in #3 should be Phase 2 
E Next costs, since this should be in the construction period, although it 
could be immediately prior to that time.  

Lisa, I skipped Rose on this email since she is out of town, and reviewed 
this agreement before she left.

Jeff Blumenthal@ECT
06/06/2000 06:44 PM
Kay and Brian,

In reply to Tim Lederach's e-mail below to Jeff Smith on June 6th, I have the 
following comments:

1.  Regarding Tim's addition of the second and third sentences to my original 
suggested language, it appears that there may be a misunderstanding.  Under 
Mexican tax law, EEIM would be obligated to withhold tax on any payments it 
makes to GE that are subject to Mexican withholding tax.  EEIM would submit 
such amounts directly to the Mexican tax authorities and, in exchange, would 
receive an official receipt (Official Form 37-A) that it could then forward 
to GE.  It appears that Tim wants to ensure that GE obtains a copy of the 
official receipt so that GE can claim a foreign tax credit on its U.S. income 
tax return for any withholding tax to which payments it receives are subject 
under Mexican tax law.  Tim's suggested additional language therefore needs 
to modified to reflect that EEIM would pay the tax and could then provide GE 
with the receipt.  I'd be glad to visit with Tim to discuss this matter.

2.  The language that I have proposed should be inserted in both the onshore 
agreement and the offshore agreement.  Tim is proposing that it be inserted 
(with his additional suggestions) only in the onshore agreement.

Please contact me at ext. 35777 if you have any questions.

Best regards,

Jeff

   
	
	

jeffreye.smith@ps.ge.com on 06/06/2000 06:08:59 PM
Kay,
See the proposed wording, below.  This is the only contract text issue I am
aware of.
Other than the items mentioned in my e-mail of June 1st/2nd (on the
consolidation agreement) and finalization of the "letter agreement" (you got
my fax), we are there.
Implied in the above, is that at this point I think the split agreement
approach would get us to closure faster.
Regards,
Jeff Smith

I have no problem with their proposed addition as it applies to the onshore
contract.  However, I would recommend modifying it as follows:

      If Purchaser is obligated to make any payment to Seller that
is subject to any withholding tax, then Purchaser shall remit the
appropriate withholding tax to the proper governmental authorities, and
Purchaser shall then remit the net amount of the payment (i.e., the gross
payment minus the applicable withholding tax) to Seller.  Seller agrees to
provide Purchaser with an original tax receipt, in Seller's name, indicating
remittance by the Purchaser of the amounts withheld.  Failure to provide
this receipt within a reasonable period of time will result in the amount
withheld becoming payable to the Seller.
Regards

tomorrow before I drop by your office.

Thank you,

Kenn Loch

Neil,  I thought you were going to tell her to just answer that he gets 
nothing at school.  She has no independent information on the rest and 
shouldn't worry about providing that info to them.

I was out of the office yesterday and apologize for the delay in responding.
I'm not sure about class/type. Michael does see Sharon Seals and Associates
Speech-Language Pathologists once a week for 1 hour. The only testing has
been from Danny Williamson, Developmental Pediatrician who is an associate
of Nancy LaFever. This was an eval for ADHD. He was also tested by SBISD for
the same issue. Williamson and LaFever have all this information in his
file.
Thanks for you help with this. Neil

Hi Neil!  Michael looked so happy to see you for chapel today.  Thanks for
being there.

I have a few questions in order to complete this form.  It asks a couple of
questions about the help he is receiving outside of school.  If you could
answer them for me, I can have this turned in tomorrow.

Classification?
Type?
Hours per Week?
Has Michael received any testing from the outside help (speech/language
specialist)?

Today Michael told me that I would "have to come over soon, because (he)
would be going far away from St. Francis for summer camp".  If he is adamant
about us getting together outside of school, I would be happy to meet you
and Michael or Michael and Kay (or his sister) for a lunch date
somewhere/sometime this summer.  Let me know.

Once again, I have really enjoyed getting to know your family.  See you at
the party Wednesday at 2:15.
Kara

Did you get my email yesterday asking for a time to have a call with Rod
and me?

>>> <Kay.Mann@enron.com> 06/06/01 08:09AM >>>

Wilson,

We are running short on time.  We are planning to sign on  Tuesday, and I
hesitate to put a new document in front of them at this late date. Would it
be easier to work with reps/warranties?

I definitely need an answer from your firm confirming (1) enforceability
(2) obligation of the Cities to financially support agreement.

Also, could you provide me with the Mississippi law defn of consequential
damages and a couple of examples where Enron could be responsible for same
under this agreement?  Also, can MDEA and the Cities be liableto Enron for
consequentials (absent a waiver)?

Your comments to the previously forwarded draft would be greatly
appreciated.

Kay

I had spoken to Rod Clement, one of our opinions guys, about having a call
with you, but we hadn't gotten around to scheduling it. What is your
availability this afternoon? Both Rod and I are available.

>>> <Kay.Mann@enron.com> 06/05/01 06:25AM >>>
Wilson,

We are trying to finalize this transaction by next Tuesday, and I could
really use your help.  I believe you owe me a draft of an opinion letter?
Also, do you have any comments to the draft agreement I sent out last week?

I also need an opinion that the language in the agreement re the Cities
obligation to financially support MDEA is sufficient.

Thank you,

Kay

GE wants a letter outlining the structure of the deal (at the 10000 ft 
level), who owns which companies, and who has payment obligations to them.  
Could you draft a letter to that effect for my review?

How polite.

Tricia, thank you for Kay Mann's  refund in the amount of $500 for the 
above-referenced seminar.  The cost of the seminar, however,  was $595.  I 
cancelled this seminar two days before the cancellation deadline of March13, 
2001 (cancellation number X197033661), but Kay was still charged the $95 
cancellation administrative fee.  Please advise when she can expect this $95 
to be credited to her American Express card.  

Thanks, Suzanne Adams

Life being what it is, I've received a mark up of the tolling term sheet, 
which crossed in the mail with the mark up you sent.  

Kay
Ben/Kay:

Attached are my comments on the Midway Tolling term sheet and LOI.  

I will be out on Monday but will have my cell phone on.  My conversations 
will be regularly interrupted by golf strokes, but I will do my best to be 
available.

Call me if you have specific questions/issues to discuss.  I have asked Dave 
Kellermeyer to call either one of you on Monday with an answer to the minimum 
block size for the tolling term sheet.  I am taking the air permit home to 
review and will leave you a message if I determine the answer.

Fred

 

Looks fine to me.  Will you accept the changes and send out?  I would like to 
receive a  bcc of whatever goes out, if possible.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay:

Attached is your draft of the LOI with revisions from the origination team.  
Please call me with any questions at x37590 or on my mobile at 713.303.4583.  
As we discussed, we would like to have something ready to send to the 
counterparty by the end of today.

Thanks-

Hi guys,

I want to make sure that you are comfortable with whatever services are being 
provided by Piper Rudnick, so that there won't be any surprises when the bill

Never stayed there.  My current favorite is the Omni, which is in one of may 
favorite locations. It has a little deli like shop across the street, where I 
can buy reasonably priced bagels, cokes, etc.  Last year I also stayed at the 
Marriott Marquis (BIG, right on Times Square) and the Mark (too snooty).  I 
stayed two other places I didn't like, but the names escape me.

 - Enron LOI.v1.522.doc <<Enron LOI.v1.522.doc>> 

I've answered all their questions, and have suggested to Chris that he ask 
NorthWestern for audited financials.  Marissa is preparing a letter which 
briefly outlines the deal, since GE had requested a letter identifying the 
parties, the payment obligations, etc.  I've given them all this information 
previously in phone calls and by email, but I think they want something 
official looking.  Probably be a good idea for you to sign the letter.

I don't think they will trade payment for a consent, but I could be wrong.  
It just isn't enough money, and GE isn't strapped for cash anyway.  I'd want 
to be careful that we don't trip up on E - Next obligations.

Kay

Kay:

I'd like to hold payment on this invoice until we receive the consent from 
GE. Any update?

Ben

The Turbopark funds request for all payments to be made next month needs to 
be submitted by Tuesday, June 12th.  This request covers the period from June 
15th to July 15th.  Are we planning to pay the $1.5 MM invoice from GE during 
this time period?  If so, I will have accounting request the funds.  If we're 
not sure if the payment will be made or not, it is better not to request the 
funds.  In this case, the payment can be treated as an "actual" for that 
month and backed out of the advance for next month.  Please let me know which 
course of action you would like to take.  

Thanks,
Rebecca   

When you ask a question you usually have heard a rumor.  What did you hear?

The New York Hilton sounds good and the location is good.  We are paying for 
this, so we don't want to spend a fortune.  I also emailed Nellie in 
Klauberg's office to see if she had any recommendations/connections.  You 
know I do make sure his bills get paid!!!!!!!

Are you going to be doing business on your vacation days because if you are, 
I'm not going to charge you.  I just don't think that's right.  Have you guys 
had any new additions to your group?

Would you read that to mean the authority to buy power "as agent for" the 
Cities?  Seems not entirely clear but not entirely out of the question.  

Kay

I'm working through the "agent for" issue, and thought I would share the 
info.  I've asked our local counsel for  a bit more direct answer (ie, his 
opinion).

Kay
I've recopied below Miss. Code Ann. Sec. 77-5-727. Subsection (u) appears to 
answer your question, at least as to purchases of electric power. I'm not 
aware of anything under the joint action agancy law that empowers the entity 
to buy gas on behalf of its members. 

Section 77-5-729 provides authority for the member utility to contract with 
the joint agency to purchase power. It's recopied below as well.

o 77-5-725. Powers of joint agencies 
Current through End of 2000 3rd Ex. Sess.
References     Annotations
Each joint agency shall have all of the rights and powers necessary or 
convenient to carry out and effectuate the purposes and provisions of this 
article, including, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the

business, and to prescribe rules, regulations and policies in connection with 
the performance of its functions and duties;

either individually or jointly, with one or more municipalities in this state 
or any other state owning electric distribution facilities or with any 
political subdivision, agencies or instrumentalities of any state, or with 
any one or more joint agencies created pursuant to this article, or any 
person, firm, association or corporation, public or private, engaged in the 
generation, transmission or distribution of electric power and energy within 
this state or any other state, and to pay all or any part of the costs 
thereof from the proceeds of bonds of the joint agency or from any other

may be required in the judgment of the joint agency and to fix and pay their

commissioners shall determine;  and 
(v) To do all acts and things necessary, convenient or desirable to carry out 
the purposes, and to exercise the powers granted to the joint agency herein. 

o 77-5-729. Contracts by members to buy power from joint agencies 
Current through End of 2000 3rd Ex. Sess.
References
Any municipality which is a member of the joint agency may contract to buy 
from the joint agency power and energy required for its present or future 
requirements, including the capacity and output of one or more specified 
projects.  As the creation of a joint agency is an alternative method whereby 
a municipality may obtain the benefits and assume the responsibilities of 
ownership in a project, any such contract may provide that the municipality 
so contracting shall be obligated to make the payments required by the 
contract whether or not a project is completed, operable, operating, retired 
or decommissioned and notwithstanding the suspension, interruption, 
interference, reduction, curtailment or termination of the output of a 
project or the power and energy contracted for, and that such payments under 
the contract shall not be subject to any reduction whether by offset or 
otherwise, and shall not be conditioned upon the performance or 
nonperformance of the joint agency or any other member of the joint agency 
under the contract or any other instrument.  Any contract with respect to the 
sale or purchase of capacity or output of a project entered into between a 
joint agency and its member municipalities may also provide that if one or 
more of such municipalities shall default in the payment of its or their 
obligations, with respect to the purchase of said capacity or output, then in 
that event the remaining member municipalities which are purchasing capacity 
and output under the contract shall be required to accept and pay for and 
shall be entitled proportionately to and may use or otherwise dispose of the 
capacity or output which was to be purchased by the defaulting municipality. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, any such 
contracts with respect to the sale or purchase of capacity, output, power or 
energy from a project may extend for a period not exceeding fifty (50) years 
from the date a project is estimated to be placed in normal continuous 
operation;  and the execution and effectiveness thereof shall not be subject 
to any authorizations or approvals by the state or any agency, commission or 
instrumentality or political subdivision thereof except as in this article 
specifically required and provided. 
Payments by a municipality under any contract for the purchase of capacity 
and output from a joint agency shall be made solely from the revenues derived 
from the ownership and operation of the electric system of said municipality 
and any obligation under such contract shall not constitute a legal or 
equitable pledge, charge, lien or encumbrance upon any property of the 
municipality or upon any of its income, receipts or revenues, except the 
revenues of its electric system, and neither the faith and credit nor the 
taxing power of the municipality are, or may be, pledged for the payment of 
any obligation under any such contract.  A municipality shall be obligated to 
fix, charge and collect rents, rates, fees and charges for electric power and 
energy and other services, facilities and commodities, sold, furnished or 
supplied through its electric system sufficient to provide revenues adequate 
to meet its obligations under any such contract and to pay any and all other 
amounts payable from or constituting a charge and lien upon such revenues, 
including amounts sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on bonds 
heretofore or hereafter issued by the municipality for purposes related to 
its electric system. 
Any municipality which is a member of a joint agency may furnish the joint 
agency with money derived solely from the ownership and operation of its 
electric system or facilities and may make available for the use of the joint 
agency any personnel, equipment and property, both real and personal, which 
is a part of its electric system or facilities. 
Any member of a joint agency may contract for, advance or contribute funds 
derived solely from the ownership and operation of its electric system or 
facilities to a joint agency as may be agreed upon by the joint agency and 
the member, and the joint agency shall repay such advances or contributions 
from proceeds of bonds, from operating revenues or from any other funds of 
the joint agency, together with interest thereon as may be agreed upon by the 
member and the joint agency. 

As I understand it, if the option is exercised (and the property bought) 
prior to the time the LLC is owned by ENext, there is a balance sheet 
impact.  

Probable time for them to bless the agreements; however, since these 
documents will not be executed until after closing, the obligations created 
under the Property Owners Association should not have a balance sheet impact.

Greg and Ben,

So is it about time to get Lisa, Herman and Rose involved in the PAD stuff?

Harlan Murphy started last week.  Nice guy from Dynegy.

I'm curious?

Why would you ask a question out of the blue?

Now, would I ask a question if I already knew the answer??????????

When you ask a question you usually have heard a rumor.  What did you hear?

The New York Hilton sounds good and the location is good.  We are paying for 
this, so we don't want to spend a fortune.  I also emailed Nellie in 
Klauberg's office to see if she had any recommendations/connections.  You 
know I do make sure his bills get paid!!!!!!!

Are you going to be doing business on your vacation days because if you are, 
I'm not going to charge you.  I just don't think that's right.  Have you guys 
had any new additions to your group?

Never stayed there.  My current favorite is the Omni, which is in one of may 
favorite locations. It has a little deli like shop across the street, where I 
can buy reasonably priced bagels, cokes, etc.  Last year I also stayed at the 
Marriott Marquis (BIG, right on Times Square) and the Mark (too snooty).  I 
stayed two other places I didn't like, but the names escape me.

I've seen some other smaller hotels which look nice, and if I check a map I 
might remember the names.

Kay

What do you guys know about the Mayflower.  We are looking for a hotel in New 
York at Christmas.

Put the land on the balance sheet is a forgiveable sin.  Incurring any other 
type of  hard costs puts the entire project (whatever that may be) on the 
balance sheet.

Kay

If we buy the property before the LLC is owned by ENext, wouldn't the big 
concern be that we've put $1.8 million of land plus an additional $900,000 or 
so of obligations to build road and stormwater system on the balance rather 
than the rather small ongoing costs related to maintainance of the road and 
system?

As I understand it, if the option is exercised (and the property bought) 
prior to the time the LLC is owned by ENext, there is a balance sheet 
impact.  

Probable time for them to bless the agreements; however, since these 
documents will not be executed until after closing, the obligations created 
under the Property Owners Association should not have a balance sheet impact.

Greg and Ben,

So is it about time to get Lisa, Herman and Rose involved in the PAD stuff?

Kay

Kay,

A&K did the title committment work and is now working on the Property 
Association Documents (as is Greenberg Traurig in West Palm Beach).  Ann 
Elizabeth's
last email message to me before she went on vacation was that A&K was the 
designated hitter for the Midway Project.    You have been copied on those 
docs which we desparately need to get to Cooney Midway Groves, the property 
owner.  As far as I know, they have not been involved in anything else 
related to Midway this year.

Christi left me a message saying that Lloyd Will or one of his guys needs to 
review the Interconnction Agreement. I do not know Lloyd.

Greg

PS we had a good meeting with DERM on the landfill closure issues in the 
Certosa Holdings deal.   I'll try to reach you this afternoon to discuss.  

 
How much involvement has A & K had on Midway?  I have other counsel engaged 
for the sale, but this falls into a different category.

I think asking David the question is a good idea.

Kay

the first part of Sec.77-5-725(u) supports your statement ("to purchase...on 
behalf of its members"). To me, that might support buying as agent in a way 
that the action of MDEA would be a binding commitment of CPU. However,  the 
second clause ("and to sell the same to its members") would seem to go the 
other way.

Also note subsections o, p and q.

Under municipal law in Miss. there is the concept that a public body may not 
"delegate" its statutory functions to others. I know you can't do it when 
it's a discretionary public function being delegated to a non-public entity. 
I'm not so sure about one public body delegating to another. I'd like to hear 
from David Hunt on this.

>>> <Kay.Mann@enron.com> 06/06/01 03:42PM >>>

Would you read that to mean the authority to buy power "as agent for" the
Cities?  Seems not entirely clear but not entirely out of the question.

Kay

Correct.  If all we were doing was buying the property, you wouldn't have the 
timing restriction.  You lose one layer of optionality.

So if we buy the property before the LLC is owned by ENext the entire project 
goes on the balance sheet since we will be committed to building a road and 
stormwater system.  There we all must be aware that we can not close on the 
property until the LLC is owned by ENext.  Do you agree?

Put the land on the balance sheet is a forgiveable sin.  Incurring any other 
type of  hard costs puts the entire project (whatever that may be) on the 
balance sheet.

I'm no oracle, but there would be no current balance sheet impact.

So, based on the forgoing, assuming we can not and do not buy the property 
until the LLC is owned by ENext then the terms of the POA docs should have no 
balance sheet impact.  Do you agree?

Correct.  If all we were doing was buying the property, you wouldn't have the

Hi Gerry,

I don't remember anyone signing a notice of lien in Arizona.  I remember 
seeing a bunch of lien notices, since they have to send a notice even if 
payment isn't due yet.  I always thought that was strange, and sure created 
clutter.  I can't remember if there was any requirement that we sign.  Does 
Dewey remember?  If you didn't sign and Dewey didn't sign, that doesn't leave 
many folks who would have done so.  I guess they could have changed the laws, 
though.   Sorry I'm not more help.  I've forgotten more than I've remembered.

If you are near town this evening, we are celebrating Paige's 21st birthday 
at Keneally's, staring around 7.  I'll buy.  I can't  believe she is 21. Very 
disruptive of my self-perception.

Ciao,

Kay

Hello Kay---

I need some free legal advice and you are my favorite attorney.  I'll buy
you a drink as payment in kind.

Try and remember El Paso work in Arizona.  Arizona has statue that says you
must make a twenty day preliminary notice to file a lien.  If you don't file
such notice you waive your right to ever file a lien.  I remember this from
our previous work out there.

We have a vendor who is supplying services to one of our subcontractors.  He
has sent us a twenty day notice to file a lien.  There is no dispute but he
is sending the notice anyway.  I understand all of that.

My question is this----it asks for us (BE&K) to sign and acknowledge receipt
of the notice.  It doesn't exactly read like I am required to acknowledge
receipt.  What do you think or remember?  Am I required to sign the notice
or not.  Minor point I know, but I'd rather not raise the flag in
Birmingham.

Thanks.  I really just want to hear from you and this is all I could come up
with for an excuse to write.

I have a phone number on a post it note on my cabinet, just to the right of 
where my computer would be if I was there.  It is a lawyers name (which of 
course I can't remember), male, with a 212 or 202 phone number.  It may be 
David something or other.  Could you email me that name and number?

Do you know if there is a way for me to save my emails that I have in folders?

Bet the weather is better than this in San Fran.

Kay

There's nothing special here.  Just cloudy.

I took Roscoe in to get neutered.  Neil just couldn't handle it.  Men are so 
funny like that.  Now I'm going to run some errands.  I hope the weather gets 
better for this evening.  They are still covering the weather 100% on the tv, 
and it looks like it is getting better.  Still more of a deal south of here.  

Kay

Since I'm "off" today and Friday, and scheduled to be in Fla on Monday, AND 
without you, I'm not in much better shape.  You know I've kept all my files 
on email.  I was hoping there would be a way to move them to a Word file of 
something.  Otherwise, I guess I'm going to have to ask you to start printing 
- highly inefficient.  I can't do it here, though.

Kay

Shepherd, near San Felipe.  Very close to Peggy's house. Peggy should be 
there, also.

Good news.
The answer is yes but there will need to be contracts between MDEA and each
of the Cities.

David,

Is it possible for MDEA to purchase power from EPMI as an agent for the
Cities?  This will obviate the need for any type of security.

Works for me.  We are leaving to check in to the hotel, then back.  I had to 
cancel manicure/pedicure ( and charged for it)  A hint that a gift 
certificate for same would work might be appropriate.

Jacoby's assistant just called and wanted your home address.  Apparently Ben 
is going to send you something or someone (manicurist/pedicurist) to your 
home.  I told her you liked champagne too if he wanted to get you a beverage 
and also that you would be leaving to go celebrate your daughter's birthday a 
little later this afternoon.  I didn't want them sending out someone and you 
not be there.  I can see you now with the phone in one hand and a manicurist 
on the other or better yet, a glass of bubbly!

Plse  have fax delivered home.

Today is the day.  I have been a mom for 21 years.  Can't be true.

Still on conference call.  Ben has been very nice. 

Is today Paige's birthday or tomorrow.  Of course if it was great news, then 
it could be a celebratory drink.  I told Ric I may come by for a drink, but I 
didn't know yet.  I think I'll call and get exact directions.

Do you need this fax I got from King and Spalding with comments on Midway?

Rob made some changes in the e-mail I sent last Friday.  He put the info 
about the Assignment and Assumption Agreement in para. 2 and used more 
defined terms from the ADA.

I think we can use the same A&A agreement to notify WestLB of our intent to 
assign the P.O. and give notice as to the closing date.  However, the current 
form of A&A agreement has sig. blocks for only ENA and WestLB.  Seems like 
you need a sig. for the assuming party!  Particularly since that party is 
purporting to give notice to WestLB of its intent to pay the purchase price!

Rose

To effectuate the movement of turbines out of the WestLB LM6000 structures 
the following needs to take place:

1) ADA - Assignment of the Purchase Option.  On at least 5 (five) days notice 
to WestLB, ENA will assign the Purchase Option for the subject equipment and 
ancillary agreement to the purchasing entity.  This assignment (the 
"Assignment")  must release the Lessor (WestLB)  from all its obligations 
under the Turbine Purchase Agreement with respect to the subject equipment 
and ancillary agreements.  This means that GE Packaged Power (a division of 
GE) and other vendors must release WestLB from its obligations with respect 
to the subject equipment and contracts.  (Kay - Could this be done by an 
amendment to the scheduled equipment under the various agreements between 
WestLB and the various vendors? Rose - I believe so, along with entering into 
the new contracts reference in 3))  

The assignment agreement to effect this is explained below and can be 
prepared by Kay, Rose or Rob.

2) ADA - Closing of the Purchase Option.  WestLB requires at least 5 (five) 
days written notice of the exercise of the purchase option and  this notice 
can be included in the Assignment and Assumption Agreement.   The purchase 
price for the subject equipment and agreements will be the "Termination 
Amount" as defined in the ADA, as allocable to the subject equipment and 
contracts.  This amount is equal to the sum of i) the aggregate outstanding 
amount of the Advances, plus ii) any Transaction Expenses then due and owing. 
plus iii) all accrued amounts due on any Lessor Yield or Facility Fee, plus 
iv) any amounts owed for any costs reasonably incurred by the Lessor with 
respect to the subject equipment and contracts.  The particular amounts of 
the foregoing costs and fees allocable to the subject equipment and contracts 
should be determined in coordination with Lisa Bills and Humberto Cubillos.

The Assignment and Assumption Agreement  used to consummate the Purchase 
Option is attached as Exhibit G to the ADA and can be prepared by Kay, Rose 
or Rob.  It needs to be executed by ENA, ENA's Designee as assignee and 
WestLB.  A detailed list of the equipment and contracts being assigned must 
be prepared by the assignee and attached to the assignment. 

3) Assignment under the Turbine Purchase Agreement.  The Purchaser (WestLB) 
under the Turbine Purchase Agreement (the "Turbine Contract") may assign a 
portion of its rights and obligations under the Turbine Contract to an 
affiliate of ENA without the Seller's consent.  Kay has structured the 
Turbine Contract to allow the assignee to enter into separate purchase 
agreements with GE Packaged Power for the equipment being assigned.   The 
documents to transfer title of the equipment from WestLB (in the case of 
equipment that is already fabricated) and  to replace ENA with another 
business unit on the purchase agreement should be prepared by the business 
unit attorneys involved in the transfer, based on a form of contract which is 
very similiar to the Master Purchase Agreement. (Rose - the assignee/new 
owner needs to step into the turbine contract even if title has  passed to 
WestLB, as there are lots of rights (warranty, indemnity) the new owner needs 
to have.  It seems to me that you would transfer title in the assignment, 
then step into the remainder of the other rights in the new contract - a/k/a 
facility agreement.  Then you delete the assigned equipment from the Master 
Agreement.)

 The tax specialists from both ENA and the acquiring business units should be 
advised as to the planned date of title transfer.  

 Same generally holds true for the ABB transformers, except that the 
assignment to an Enron SPV may require a form of security.  

At the very least, the cancellation charges are theirs.

Exactly what I told Lorie (send her a gift certificate for a manicure and 
pedicure), but she kind of balked.  I'm not sure of her taste.  It'll be 
interesting to see what they send you.  Let me know.

Gorman's will be picking up/delivering on Tues/Fri.  They had Mon/Thurs 
available, but Monday am is too hard to remember.  Besides, Delmis may be 
able to bring our clothes in on Tuesdays, and I'm generally home early on 
Friday.

Our driver's name is David.  His cell phone is 713 545 4186.  We can call him 
if we ever need pick up/delivery on a different day.

He will leave us a sack today.

How's that for cool?

Both are in VEPCO, names under the Word icon on the email.  I'll try to

It's easier if you just tell me the names because I have to know

I got my hair cut - it feels so good to get it cut.

I'm planning on going as scheduled.  Do lots of people go to this?

Oh, I found them. My point was that you don't have to go to the trouble of 
attaching them.   You can just tell me where they are and I can go from 
there.  No sense making it more difficult than it is.  Then again, this might 
not be difficult for you.

Both are in VEPCO, names under the Word icon on the email.  I'll try to 
remember next time.

It's easier if you just tell me the names because I have to know 
directories.  I assume these are in your VEPCO files.  I'm going to try and 
see if Comparerite works. If not, I'll do it the old fashion way, the Word

FYI -- Here is the e-mail we discussed regarding the most current versions of 
each policy.

Gregg
	
	

Welcome back.  I am sure you have been looking forward to getting all these 
documents, so here they are.  Attached are the following:

1)

Current draft of the MEH Risk Policy.  Kay, Mary and I have discussed the 
current draft line by line and are at the point where your review is needed 
to proceed.  Vlady has reviewed the current draft and has no significant 
changes.  

2)

Current draft of the Risk Procedures and Control Guidelines and accompanying 
flowcharts.  Brent Price and his team have reviewed the Procedures and have 
provided revisions where appropriate.  Linda and Mary have also provided 
input which has been incorporated.  I need to circulate the draft to all 
parties one more time to make sure everyone is comfortable with the last 
updates and that there are no inconsistencies.

3)

Current draft of the credit policy as last revised by Aparna.  The draft was 
sent last night to Molly Harris at Enron for her review and I am currently 
waiting to hear from her.  If there are any changes to this draft I will 
notify you promptly and forward the newest draft.

4)
Current draft of the proposed cash management policy.  Jim Burns has reviewed 
the proposed cash management policy and is in general agreement with the 
procedures.  We will be drafting a Facility Agreement shortly which will 
cover the specifics of the Enron Revolver to MEH.

As for reports and a general understanding of limit development, modeling, 
stress testing, etc., there have been several meetings over the last week.  
Brent Price and his team were in Chicago last week to go over the daily 
reports with Linda, Tim, Maria, Kay and Mary and discuss the development of 
the Daily Position Report (DPR). To my knowledge, the only outstanding report 
is the DPR.  The DPR you received on Tuesday was not an MEH only DPR and was 
not scrubbed before it was sent out.  It was intended to show the format, but 
they inadvertently pulled numbers into it.  I am expecting that a scrubbed 
DPR will be sent out end of this week (Since the EMW and MEH books are 
currently "flat", the DPR will not show any open positions or VAR - we can 
discuss in more detail if you want).  Regarding risk management 
methodologies, Mary has had discussions with Vlady and our research staff and 
I have received positive feedback regarding the sharing of information.  

I realize this is a large amount of information to digest, but I would like 
to get together as soon as you have a chance to review the policies and talk 
to Mary, Kay, Linda, etc. in order to come up with a list of any remaining 
issues.  I acknowledge that this should and will be a evolutionary process, 
but I also want to have a clear direction of what is necessary to approve the 
policies.   Just let me know when you are available and I will make myself 
available.

Thanks,

Gregg

Oh, I found them. My point was that you don't have to go to the trouble of 
attaching them.   You can just tell me where they are and I can go from 
there.  No sense making it more difficult than it is.  Then again, this might 
not be difficult for you.

Sounds good.

I'm on a conference call that won't end.  I received your fax and will try to 
call you this afternoon.

I received today notarized copies of the Resolutions of Support from the
Edgecombe County Commissioners, the City Council and Mayor, and the local
economic development organization, Carolinas Gateway.

I will file them with the Commission when we file the cost data late this
week or early next week.  That would also be a good time to file any project
updates, such as information regarding the generators.

Bob (and others),

The line  of credit on EPC 4 is expired, and I believe tapped out, if you add 
in the fee to Enron ($5mm?) which remains unpaid.   Another option would be 
to try to get a security interest in the revenues on 4 for the new project.  
I have been looking in to this option since you, Erik and I discussed this 
possibility.  Input from Mexican counsel will be required and has been 
sought.  

Dick has scheduled a meeting for later today when we can brainstorm on these 
options.  I'm confident that there will be a way to skin this cat, it just 
may take a few days to sort through.

David,

To mitigate the risk of funding Demar before an assignment of contract 
revenue for the EPC-43/50 offshore work is in place we could seek written 
confirmation from Demar that the present assignment of contract revenues can 
be utilized to cover early advances for this new work.  It is my 
understanding that there is in excess of $60MM to collect and the present 
$20MM line of credit is funded to $16MM+.

The collateral in place is a barge worth approximately $12MM, property in Cd. 
del Carmen worth approximately $3.2MM and a house in Mexico City worth 
approximately $500,000.  Obviously the source of repayment is the revenue 
from the Pemex contract EPC-4 which we receive in a bank account controlled 
by Enron.

Practically, the Pemex contract will likely take 30 days to execute and an 
assignment of contract revenues which can only be requested after the 
contract execution, will take approximately 1 week to have in hand.  Due to 
urgent nature of the work, that is, it will start immediately upon advice of 
award from Pemex, Demar can not wait some 40 days for funding.  

Our experience with Demar has been good, so good as a matter of fact that we 
have decided not to provide the administrative support in Cd. del Carmen and 
Mexico City to which we are  obligated in our agreement with Demar.

I ask all members of the team to consider the possibility of funding 
initially under the EPC-4 agreements, which need to be extended in any event 
and to add language to cover this issue would be fairly straight forward.

Bob MacMillan  

Hi Mike,

Sorry I missed you when you returned by call this am.

I have some concerns about the voice mail you left re: assignment language.  
Enron can't stay on the hook for payment if the agreement is assigned, as 
this would bust the financing/accounting arrangement.  What we have tried to 
do to meet your concerns is to see that ABB has a contract with a party which 
is as financially sound as Enron by adding the guaranty language.  This 
addresses ABB's request that the party with the payment obligation have the 
"financial wherewithall" to make the payments. This is a big change from 
where we were in the last contract. 

I've had a request to get an approximate storage cost (monthly) for budgetary 
purposes.  This is in connection with the buy back arrangement.  Can you give 
me a guesstimate?

Thanks,

Kay

Allyson,

Will the certification of necessity be specific to ENA?  I ask this because I 
suspect that at some point we will want a special purpose company to be 
involved.  This provides us with the option of selling the equity of the 
entity developing the project.

Your advise is appreciated.

Kay

I need your employee number so I can do your expense report.  You should have

Here's the clean version (no redline) of the most recent draft of the PPA.  I

Tammy Shepperd and myself have been asked to maintain the status of Enron's 
turbine position.  This list includes the 24 LM6000s, all other ENA turbines 
and all Enron turbines to the extent information is available.  The file 
includes 3 worksheets:

Turbine Inventory:  lists the turbine, delivery, ownership, project 
commitment and other related items.
LM6000 Status:  includes delivery, configuration, project commitment and 
other related items.
LM6000 Assign:  less detailed schedule with the delivery, project commitment 
and current availability.

In the future, to maintain the integrity of this information, the file will 
NOT be emailed, but will accessible from the following location in a Read 
Only format:

O:\NAES\Master Turbine Listing.xls

It is our view that requiring users to access the actual directory will be 
the most efficient method of assuring the user is receiving up-to-date 
information.  As project needs arise or change, please email or contact Tammy 
Shepperd at (713) 853-6589 or myself at (713) 853-3526.  In addition, if 
there is other information that would be useful, let us know.

I am attaching a redline of a revised version of the document formerly known

I am sending it without anyone else reading it (a gutsy and foolhardy move),

VISITORS' GUIDE TO HOUSTON, TX
(To enable our many visitors to cope with life in America's Fourth Largest
City)

1. First you must learn to pronounce the city name. It is YEWS-TUN and it
does not matter how people pronounce it in other places.

2. Forget the traffic rules you learned elsewhere. Houston has its own
version of traffic rules. Never forget that downtown Houston is composed
entirely of one way streets. The only way to get out of the center of town
is to turn around and start over when you reach Dallas, Texas.

3. All directions start with, "Go down Westheimer..."

4. Westheimer has no beginning and no end.

5. It's impossible to go around a block and wind up on the street you
started on. The Chamber of Commerce calls this a "scenic drive".

6. The 8 AM rush hour is from 6:30 to 9:30 AM. The 5:00 PM rush hour is from
3:30 to 7:15 PM. Friday's rush hour starts on Thursday morning.

7. If you actually stop at a yellow light, you cannot be from Houston.

8. Reversible Lanes are not understood by anybody.

9. A native Houstonian is the only one who can pronounce Kuykendahl Road, so
do not attempt the phonetic pronunciation. People will simply tilt their
heads to the right and stare at you.

10. The falling of one raindrop or (God forbid) one snowflake causes all
traffic to immediately cease; so will daylight savings time and a girl
applying eye shadow across the street, or a flat tire three lanes over.

11. Construction on the Gulf Freeway is a way of life, and a permanent form
of entertainment.

12. Many bizarre sights can be explained simply by uttering the phrase, "Oh,
we're in Montrose!!"

13. Construction crews aren't doing their job properly unless they close
down all lanes except one during rush hour.

14. If someone actually has their turn signal on, it was probably left on at
the factory where the car was made.

15. Understand that the 95 pound woman driving the Ford Excursion (the
largest vehicle ever produced) absolutely MUST come to a complete stop, then
proceed at 2.5 mph over any railroad track. What's the deal? This vehicle
was built to invade small countries, and she's worried about the railroad
tracks!!

16. All ladies with blue hair who drive Cadillacs or Lincoln Continentals
have the right of way.

17. The above mentioned blue haired ladies also have a legal right to turn
right from a left lane or to turn left from a right lane. YOU HAVE BEEN
WARNED!

18. White haired men driving red or silver sports cars will not obey any
known traffic rule and cannot be expected to stop for red lights or stop
signs.

19. Buying a Houston street map is a waste of money since there is
absolutely no way that you can route yourself in such a manner as to avoid
major road construction.

20. Buying a Houston street map is a waste of money since the termination or
continuation of any street is entirely at the discretion of the Streets
Department of the City. It has been determined that the length of any street
on any given day is a mystery known only to "Higher Powers" in the
department, and it is rumored that they do not speak to mere mortals.

21. Asking directions will help you get acquainted with the numerous recent
residents of an amazing ethnic diversity. It will be of no help at all for
finding the address you seek.

22. If searching for a street on the southwest side of Houston, a knowledge
of Chinese, Korean, or Vietnamese is somewhere between helpful and
mandatory, since the street signs are printed in one of these languages
along with English. However, often the English name for the street has been
removed.

23. Houston natives are so rare that they are listed on the endangered
species list. The few remaining specimens are kept in a controlled
environment for their own safety.

24. "Sir" and "Ma'am" are used by the person speaking to you if there's a
remote possibility that you're at least 30 minutes older than they are. You
can safely address anyone as "Sir" or "Ma'am" in Houston as in other
southern cities.

25. "Sugar" is a more common form of address than "Miss". So is "Honey". Do
not take offence. This is how southerners address grown women.

26. In Houston we drink Coca-Cola and Dr. Pepper. It is rumored that other
soft drinks are sold here, but no one will admit to knowing anyone who
actually drinks them. So don't ask for any other soft drink.

27. What you need to know when arriving at Bush Intercontinental Airport:
Your arrival gate is at least 32 miles away from the Main Concourse of any
terminal. Walking heels on your boots or walking shoes are advised.

28. Wherever you are going will be on the other side of town. When
attempting to cross Houston, assume the trip will take a minimum of 4 hours
and can take as long as 24 hours.

29. If attempting to cross Houston via the freeway system, it is advisable
to carry a supply of Coca-Cola, water, a few sandwiches, and something to
read while waiting on the freeway for the traffic jam to clear. Some
moderately fast readers have been known to read a 1,000-page novel during
the course of one traffic jam. If attempting to cross Houston during rush
hour, additional provisions are advisable.

30. Never get on a Houston freeway without taking a restroom break first! It
may be a long time to the next break.

31. Never honk your horn at another car in Houston traffic. The bumper
sticker that reads, "Keep honking, I'm reloading" is considered fair
warning.

Hi Dutch,

In speaking with Allyson, she believes we need to have the responses the 
Public Staff's data request no later than sometime next week.  The Staff 
wants to have a meeting or conference call to discuss our responses during 
the week of August 28th.  Therefore, Allyson suggests that we have a call 
this week to discuss how and when we will pull this information together.  
Sounds like a good idea.

Please let me know when you are available for the call this week.  I suspect 
it will take between 30-45 minutes.  Also, please let me know if you have NOT 
received a copy of the data request, as these should have arrived via company 
mail.

Thanks,

Kay
Could we set up a conference call in the next day or two to go over the data
requests, establish a responsible party for putting together the information
for each question, and set a time frame for getting it in?  I am tied up
most of Thursday afternoon, but am generally available the rest of the week.

I thought I'd e:mail the revised data requests upon receipt;  if I haven't
heard from Gisele by this afternoon, I will fax them.  :Let me know if you
are interested in receiving copies of the local government resolutions.
There are no surprises; they simply adopted and signed what I drafted
without even retyping them.

Hi there,
?
When I was at Monday's Astros' game, I thought I heard them say that Enron is 
sponsoring some type of kid's book drive at next Sunday's game.? I have quite 
a few gently used kids books I am looking to give away, so I was wondering if 
I could do it in connection with that program.? I will not be at the game 
Sunday, and I didn't locate a reference to the program on your website.
?
Is there a way for me to donate kids books for whatever program Enron is 
sponsoring, without going to the game?
?
Many thanks!

The current structure (including VEPCO in Cornhusker under our Fair Value 
Model) does not contemplate credit support.  There currently is not credit 
support of the actual project co (Ponderosa Pine) under the Cornhusker 
structure.  ENA typically does not provide credit support of project co's 
under the fair value model because of certain bright line tests under the 
fair value model for an asset purchase to qualify for fair value.  

From a bank financing and economic perspective, ENA has a total return swap 
with Delta Power, the 100% owner of Ponderosa Pine (Ponderosa Pine is 
bankruptcy remote).

There possibly could be credit support from ENA for the project co if we were 
compensated a fair value fee for the support, but this issue has never been 
tested with AALLP (would need third party fairness opinion).  In the end, 
there could only be a form of financial support, not a performance 
guarantee.

you don't need them though.

I went out to lunch and it's so hot outside.  I'm just now cooling off after 
about 3 big jugs of water.  Of course it's running right through me.  

Let me know if you need me to do anything.

I'm flying to somewhere (probably DC) tonight, returning on Friday.  Ozzie is 
making the travel arrangements, so you don't need to do anything.  I'll let 
you know what else I find out.

Thanks,

suzanne,

Please resend the August 15 redline to the Virginia Power people on the list 
I gave you.

Kay,

Your contract draft sent on 8/15/00 goes only through Section 7.2.  Did
something happen in the transmission?

You know how Remote Control!!!!!!!  How fun!!!

Nannie, nannie, my husband is going to Tulsa for 2 full weeks and possibly 
until Thanksgiving after that!  

Kathleen

John,

The price includes shipment to the site and installation, but not connection. 
Therefore, there is no additional freight charge.

The meeting that was scheduled for 9am this morning has been moved back to 
3pm CDT.  For those of you in Houston, we will be meeting on the 50th floor 
at 50 M03.  If you cannot make it, please let me know sometime during the day.

Allyson and others calling in: I will have a call-in number by noon.

Thank you.

fyi
We had done a fair amount of research on the annexation issue which we have
suspended in light of the attached information recently received from Bill
Sherk and Steve Raper.  If NCNG concedes the right to serve, the only issue
is the tap.  That is an NCUC jurisdictional issue, and Bill is correct that
the Commission would have no sympathy if NCNG refused to work with Rocky
Mount on that point.  

Just spoke with Bill Sherk and he confirmed, almost verbatim, Steve Raper's
report.  According to Bill, George Baldwin, VP of Marketing, stated that
NCNG does not contest Rocky Mount's right to serve.  

I asked Bill to desride the location of the site---Bill says the site is
less than 2 miles from Rocky Mount's incorporated limits. Rocky Mount will
own the site (thus, meeting the requirement of getting all landowners to
sign a petition for satellite annexation).  The site is outside the area
described in the service agreement with NCNG.  

Bill said the remaining issue with NCNG is the necessary increased pressure.
Rob Shaw, NCNG, is checking with their operations to determine whether NCNG
can provide the necessary pressure.  Sherk's engineer states the NCNG "would
not have a leg to stand on" if they state they cannot provide adequate
pressure.  Rocky Mount would complain to the Commission and NCNG would "look
bad."  Rob Shaw is supposed to report back to Sherk today and he will let us
know NCNG's response immediately. 

Thanks 

Interesting...

bill sherk met w/ ncng officials yesterday.  they indicated they felt the
city would have the right to serve the site and hinted they would not
contest.  however, they said they "had to check with their operations
people" to determine if their pipeline and system at that location would
support/provide the needed pressure and volume for the enron plant.  this
may be the 'catch' we all expect.  however, atleast they appear not to be
readying themselves for a legal fight over service.  bill will advise enron
of these latest developments..

NEPCO's position sounds more typical for a cost plus contract.  Is this a 
lump sum deal? If so, then I think NEPCO is taking an aggressive approach to 
both LOL and retention.  A 10% limit of liability during the warranty period 
is particularly aggressive, unless there are a lot of carve outs to the limit 
of liability, and other give-and-takes which make it make sense. Another 
factor which might make a difference is the treatment given to the GE 
contract.  Is NEPCO taking risk on GE performance, and is the dollar value of 
the GE equipment included in the price used to figure the % of liability?

I'm glad to discuss this if I can be of help.

Kay - Ron Coker in the CTG group suggested you might be able to help with 
this.

ENA/SF is in the middle of negotiating the EPC contract for Pastoria (750 MW) 
with NEPCO.  We have hit a couple of snags in the contract and would very 
much appreciate your input as to what is "market." 

1. Limit of Liability -  NEPCO would like 80% up to Substantial Completion, 
40% up to Final Acceptance, and 10% for the Warranty Period.  GE's LOL is 
100% of their contract value though the warranty period. (which Kiewit also 
agreed to on Pittsburg.)
2. Retention - NEPCO would like to have 10% retention on payments only for 
the first 5% on the contract value and then 5% retention thereafter.  We 
would prefer 10% throughout the payment schedule.

What do you think?  We want the Owner's position to be as strong as possible 
to enhance the sale of the project, but NEPCO is under a great amount of 
pressure to reduce their contingent liability, and we really don't want to 
leave them holding the bag once we are gone if it is not necessary.

Kathy,

Could you please accommodate Karen's request?  If you would like, you can 
just send it to me and I will get it to her.  If you have delivered my

Kay,

I was wondering if it might be possible to obtain a copy of the Transformer 
contract executed with ABB as well as any change order contracts which were 
submitted to GE?  If you're not the person from whom I should request this 
information, could you please point me in the right direction?  Thanks.

Karen

I can send you what I have on the WestLB stuff, but it may not help too much 
if you are trying to figure out how to get turbines into a project.  We are 
currently working on the mechanics relating to that.

It may take a while to get a copy, as I don't have an electronic version and 
I'm currently in meetings where I'm using my hard copy.  How soon do you need 
it?

Kay

Hi Kay.  Thanks for this input.  My somewhat knee-jerk reaction has been that 
NEPCo is, indeed, taking a very aggressive approach.  We are also hearing 
that they are under some sort of "mandate" to include these provisions in 
their contracts on a going forward basis (I think I might have some idea of 
what that's about), but we are obviously concerned that it won't fly with a 
third party buyer of our project.  Dean, Jim Fowler (our outside counsel at 
McCutchen) and I may want to chat about it with you further.

On a related note, I keep running into the need to have a more basic 
understanding of the West LB documents and the GE LM-6000 contract than I 
have.  Do you have copies of those documents, and could I ask you to have 
copies made and sent to me?  Much appreciated.

Hope all is well,
Karen

Well, uh, I'm supposed to be "educated" on it by Mon or Tues, but maybe the 
"mechanics" you are working on will be what I need.  Do you know if Harlan 
Wendell (McCutchen lawyer who did our GE contract for Pastoria) has copies?  
If so, I can get him to send.  Thanks.

HELP!  What's my R/C number?    Is it 00406373?  Does that look like an RC?

We need to get an invoice from the travel agency Heather and Ozzie used for 
my flights last week.  I know the travel agent's name is Julie, but I don't 
know the details.  The agency is something like Vitol.  I suspect Claudette 
can give you the telephone number, etc.  I would have gotten a receipt from 
Continental, but the E ticket machine wasn't working.

I have the rest of the receipts.

I'm still not wild about 27.5, which says they have no liability for any 
advice they give us which is not required by the agreement.  It seems that we 
could get into an argument about causation of a problem, and what was in/out 
of their scope under the agreement.  

I don't know that I have any brilliant ideas about how to narrow this carve 
out. I guess we could say no liability so long as the advice is clearly 
outside the scope of work, and is given in good faith and in accordance with 
industry standards.

Just to catch you up a bit...
Heather Kroll@ECT

To all:

In our last meeting with VEPCO we presented a structure that would 

1).  Allow Enron to sell the Edgecombe plant to VEPCO at a fixed price at the 
end of the term of the PPA (around $325/kW)
2).  Allow VEPCO to buy the plant from us at a fixed price at the end of the 
term of the PPA (around $425/kW).

This structure caps our downside risk into a quantifiable number (it also 
limits our upside but we're willing to give that up to protect against a big 
negative hit).

In order to evaluate this structure, VEPCO has asked for some specific plant 
information.  We have most of this info in various forms and I would like 
your help pulling it together.

1).  Full plant description (equipment, design, drawings)
2).  Construction costs (have we gotten updated NEPCO numbers for this 
project?)
3).  Permits (timeline for obtaining, run hours allowed on both natural gas 
and fuel oil, emission limits)
4).  Fuel contracts (in process).

Please let me know what you have and an estimate on timing to get the rest of 
the request.

If we can negotiate this structure with VEPCO, we will make a significant 
jump in getting the internal okay to move forward.

Thanks for your help,

Heather

Could you please go through the option agreement I have in my directory on 
O.  It is under Option Agreements, and it is the only document there.  It 
should be called Fehr land option, or something similiar.  Please go search 
and make Optionor plural throughout, and make the grammar match.  I started 
making the changes, but got distracted from the task.

Jeff and Reynaldo Garcia spoke on this subject at length, and Rey convinced 
Jeff that spitting was necessary.  AT that time the Enron Contracting entity 
was not specified to be Energia...    If you want to unsplit the documents it 
will add additional time in excess geting a consolidation agreement completed 
I think.  Please include Rey in your quest for closure.  PS  GE is now OK 
with the split.

I need help getting closure on the Consolidation Agreement.  I hope that we 
do not invent other issues as well.

John,

The executed signature page has been faxed per your instructions.

I'm going to miss you really badly. Are you sure you want to go to the cool 
air, unwind, sip wine and eat delicious food?  And miss all this???????

I believe this task is complete.

Could you please go through the option agreement I have in my directory on 
O.  It is under Option Agreements, and it is the only document there.  It 
should be called Fehr land option, or something similiar.  Please go search 
and make Optionor plural throughout, and make the grammar match.  I started 
making the changes, but got distracted from the task.  
Thanks,

Kay

I shouldn't have looked at that when I'm so hungry.  What an incredible menu 
- and in a relatively small town.  You better take a wad of fatburners!!!

Just being out of this nasty smog will be great.  Plus, I bet it is nice 
there when the sun goes down.  What a great time of year to make that trip.

Can you hear my heavy sighs?  It is time for me to plan something fun, even a 
short trip.  Planning and looking forward to it is 1/2 the fun.

Oh, it's nice to know I'll be missed.  It's pretty warm and humid over there 
right now, but I'm sure we'll unwind, sip wine and eat our way through the 
valley.  Don't forget we have to go so we can bring you wine that's not sold 
in Texas!!!!!!!

Please let me know if you have it and if so if you can send me a copy to EB

Just a reminder to send me the description you gave the school.

Hi Brian,

What a great surprise!  

Life is pretty good.  To see a summary, you might want to check out Paige's 
website: http://www.southwestern.edu/~recordp/  (I tried to copy that as a 
link, but I think I messed up.)

I guess Peggy told you (or you figured out from my email address) that I'm 
working at Enron. I like it.  I enjoy being back downtown after being a 
suburban lawyer.  Home life is relatively calm, which has always been a goal 
of mine.  I'm dealing with my folks getting older, with the health problems 
which come with that process.  Overall, I'm very blessed and happy.

How about you?  If you are spending time at HM, you must still be doing the 
law thing. I might have lost a bet on that one.  So how's your life?  

Paige completed her minor in German.  Consider it a Wunder legacy!  Her 
brother, Michael is a real charmer.  You would get a huge kick out of him.

Thanks so much for writing.  I can't wait to hear what is going on with you.

Kay

Kay,

I've been spending some time at Hays McConn in the past few weeks --
depositions.  I saw Peggy and we spoke about you.  I just wanted to know how
you and Paige were doing.

Brian

Hi Guys,

Is the 501D in storage?  If not, when will it be delivered?  I'm asking in 
connection with information to be provided in the CPCN process.

Thanks,

Kay

Jeff:

Here's a draft for your review:

I suggest that the payment terms for the offshore contract require the intial 
payment to be made within 7 business days of execution.  That way, we can 
sign this up next week.

Kay

Could we benefit from an internal meeting prior to the call?

Kay

Heather Kroll@ECT

I have scheduled the conference call for Wednesday afternoon at 3:00 CPT.  
The call-in information is as follows:

Number: 1.800.991.9019
Passcode: 6207851

I will reserve one of the big conference rooms on 29 so everyone in Houston 
can participate from the same room.  

Please forward this to anyone I've left off the list.

Regards,

Heather

We are at the MOU stage.  Need to keep off the balance sheet duly noted and 
emphasized in a commercial meeting last Friday.  Commercial leads at ENA and 
Global Finance are out this week, so no progress at the moment.  The 
information I was given is that we want to get it done by the end of 
September.  How does this sound?

Kay

PS  Also includes 2 transformers.

Lisa Mellencamp@ECT
08/22/2000 02:41 PM
can you tell me what the status on this is??
important obviously to keep off balance sheet as we discussed.

Attached is a draft blackline and clean copy of the Edgecombe PPA.  We did not
address the issue of security in this draft, but still regard it as an open 
item
subject to further discussion.

We look forward to receiving the information on the fuel arrangements, 
equipment
specifications and construction cost estimates so we can better evaluate the
proposal you presented last Thursday.

Heather,

Did you want to send this?  Anything else you want to add?

LM's # 1-6, 19-20, plus a couple of ABB transformers.

Bill, 

I'm attaching an electronic copy of the letter we sent to Westinghouse.  If 
you email me your fax number, I'll fax you their response.

Thanks,

Kay

Hi there,

Paige is still here.  I think she may leave tomorrow.  Have you ever visited 
her website?  Here's a link:
http://www.southwestern.edu/~recordp/

You might trying clicking on the link to see if it takes you directly to her 
web page.  She will have the same email address again this year.  I suspect 
she will have the same mailing address as well, since it is a box number.  

Michael slept well this weekend.  He had a great birthday.  He takes his 
dinosaur everywhere.  It is so funny, because the button gets pushed 
accidently when it is being hauled around, so it is constantly growling.

We saw a few drops of rain, but nothing to help the water bill.  The smog is 
horrible.

I'm in town all week this week, which is nice.  Neil and I have a birthday 
party to go to for our neighbor Donnie (he was at the party) on Friday, so 
Michael will spend some time with Charlotte again. She should be off of most 
of her restrictions tomorrow, so maybe he will get to see her more.  

We went to the Astros game last night, and they actually won.  Sammy Sosa hit 
a home run harder than any I've seen before.  Even some of the Astros fans 
clapped at the sheer force of it.  The pitcher said he watched it, just 
because he had never seen such an awesome hit.  

Too bad about the heat, but what the heck can you do about it anyway?

Love,

Kay

Bill and Rita McCall <bmccall@wcnet.net> on 08/22/2000 10:17:25 AM
Hi Kay Kay,Just wanted to say Hi. Did Houston really see rain today? We had
about five drops. We have had a nice quiet week. We did buy five pounds of
shrimp from Grassy Point. Has Michael rested up from this birthday party?
We plan to be here until sometime next week. Has Paige gone back to school
and will she still have the same email address? Tell neil Dad will sent a
fishing report when he has one. He really has not fished much. It's just to
hot. Love,Mother

Just a reminder about tomorrow's call.  Enron participants, we will have a 
conference room on the 38th floor of EB available.

In an effort to pull the pieces together, a meeting has been scheduled to 
discuss the draft energy and capacity contract (formerly the PPA).  It is 
scheduled for Thursday, August 24th, at 900am.  We are still in the process

Gentlemen:

I have been advised by J. Nassos that Peoples (through WestLB) will be 
exercising the ABB option today. I have asked that they send me a copy of the 
notice of exercise of option, and I left Mike Sandridge a voice mail telling 
him to expect it this afternoon.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

At least drinks and coffee. Thanks for thinking of it.

I sent an email to everyone (actually just replied to your email but to all)

I left the response (which is a letter from Siemens Westinghouse) on the part 
of my desk which is next to the window.  I MAY have put it in a file folder 
labeled "Westinghouse".  The letter references a letter we sent to them in 
the first line.  Please find the letter and fax to Bill.  Thanks a bunch.

It would be very helpful if you could participate, or have your designee 
participate.  Sorry for  the short notice (what else is new). Perhaps we can 
also arrange a discussion about the interconnection agreement.

I'm out this am, but will pick up voice mail.

Thanks,

Attached is a draft blackline and clean copy of the Edgecombe PPA.  We did not
address the issue of security in this draft, but still regard it as an open 
item
subject to further discussion.

We look forward to receiving the information on the fuel arrangements, 
equipment
specifications and construction cost estimates so we can better evaluate the
proposal you presented last Thursday.

Jeff,

I'll focus on the consolidation agreement today.

It seems to me that the time GE has to remit the payment to ENA should 
remain  3 days.  I don't see a reason to stretch it to  7 days, since it 
represents a double payment.  Your thoughts?

Looks like the tax issues are completed.

Kay

jeffreye.smith@ps.ge.com on 06/09/2000 02:50:12 PM
AGREED!
I just corrected what I think is a typo ("has" instead of "as", in a
Whereas), and changed the 3 to a 7 for days.
All we need is the Consolidation Agreement.
Per our last telecon, we should only be making statements dealing with the
fact that we have two contracts instead of one, not adding statements or
taking actions etc, which should be accomplished under one or the other
contract.
Regards,
Jeff Smith

 <<Termination MOUrev2.doc>> Jeff:
Here's a draft for your review:
(See attached file: Termination MOUrev2.doc)
I suggest that the payment terms for the offshore contract require the
intial payment to be made within 7 business days of execution.  That way, we
can sign this up next week.

There's a meeting with a cast of characters to discuss the Westinhouse

in sitting in?

The proposed agenda for tomorrow's meeting is as follow:

Low frequency sound issue
Megawatt limit @ 182 Mw
Use of evap cooler
Heat Rate deficiency
Late equipment deliveries 

We can also talk about Wheatland performance.

Let me know if there is anything else we need to add to the agenda.

Thanks,   John

What did Heather tell you?

Would this be ok re Christi?

call.

John Moore is unable to attend the meeting scheduled for Thursday at 9:00 
a.m., so we were wondering if you guys would be available at 9:00 a.m. on 
Friday.  Please let me know.  Thanks, Suzanne, x37340 or via email

In an effort to pull the pieces together, a meeting has been scheduled to 
discuss the draft energy and capacity contract (formerly the PPA).  It is 
scheduled for Thursday, August 24th, at 900am.  We are still in the process 
of locating a conference room, so the location is TBD.

Thanks,

That should work, since our 3:00 is being obviated by our 12:30.

The room is 3AC5C1, according to this email.  I didn't check to see what it 
was before.

I've changed it on your calendar.  I suppose it's in the same room.

Suggest you call him to confirm.

It doesn't look like Friday morning will work.  How do you guys look for 
Thursday afternoon at 3:00 p.m.  We can have the meeting in EB38C1.  Please 
advise via telephone (x37340) or email asap!  Thanks!

In an effort to pull the pieces together, a meeting has been scheduled to 
discuss the draft energy and capacity contract (formerly the PPA).  It is 
scheduled for Thursday, August 24th, at 900am.  We are still in the process 
of locating a conference room, so the location is TBD.

Thanks,

Kay

Here are the most recent comments from VEPCO:

Some of you may have received this already.  I have not compared it against 
what we last sent them.

CR [aka conference room] 5C1.  I know they are in the Allen Center.  I'm just 
damn smart, that's all.

Where do you see that room?  I saw no room information yet.

Team Vitro:

I wanted to run these changes by you before sending them to Jeff Smith.

Jeff S. has lobbied for deleting the language on assignment, and state that 
assignment of the consolidation agreement will be subject to the same terms, 
etc. as the other 2 contracts.  He also provide alternative language which 
appears to be close to what was in the previous draft. Since I didn't know 
the genesis of the language in the consolidation agreement, so I thought I 
would check with you first.

I eliminated 5 (a) because the contracts allow for partial termination.

Not finished yet.

Hey, what happened to those docs that you said had to be fed exd to Legner?  
I've written his address and put it in my red book for the temporary in case 
you need her to send them out.  I've also got an extra copy of his address 
for me just in case we need it.  Just thought I'd let you know.

Looks like Thursday at 300pm is working out for most people to meet to 
discuss the VEPCO PPA. The meeting will be held in EB38C1.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Kay

Yikes.  Would you have just 30 minutes sometime during the afternoon 
tomorrow?  I really struck out with everyone else for Friday.  Otherwise, 
I'll be glad to schedule a meeting on Friday (in addition to this one 
tomorrow) to review the structure with the various players.  You pick a time 
(the earlier being better for me).

Thanks,

Kay

Attached is a draft blackline and clean copy of the Edgecombe PPA.  We did not
address the issue of security in this draft, but still regard it as an open 
item
subject to further discussion.

We look forward to receiving the information on the fuel arrangements, 
equipment
specifications and construction cost estimates so we can better evaluate the
proposal you presented last Thursday.

Yikes.  Would you have just 30 minutes sometime during the afternoon 
tomorrow?  I really struck out with everyone else for Friday.  Otherwise, 
I'll be glad to schedule a meeting on Friday (in addition to this one 
tomorrow) to review the structure with the various players.  You pick a time 
(the earlier being better for me).

Looks like Thursday at 300pm is working out for most people to meet to 
discuss the VEPCO PPA. The meeting will be held in EB38C1.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

I hope to go, at least Friday/Saturday, assuming we have a sitter for 
Michael, of course.

I met Mrs. Kerekgarto yesterday.  

Chris Duerr (duerrc@spring-branch.isd.tenet.edu/).  Maybe you should ask to 
visit which ever classroom Chris thinks Michael would  be in assuming he 
started at VO on September 5.  Just a suggestion.  Or maybe you can visit 
more than one class.  You might want to ask to visit a class during an 
academic time (as opposed to when the kids are in centers).

I know a lot can happen in 60 days but what do you think the chances are you
will go today? I will not send anything to Rose Mary yet. NM

Here is a rough draft of the Fehr option.  Herman, you will be happy to know 
that this one is much shorter.

It needs some clean up, but this should be enough to get comments going.

Kay

This time I'll include the attachment.  It must be Monday.

Kay

   

Team Vitro:

I wanted to run these changes by you before sending them to Jeff Smith.

Jeff S. has lobbied for deleting the language on assignment, and state that 
assignment of the consolidation agreement will be subject to the same terms, 
etc. as the other 2 contracts.  He also provide alternative language which 
appears to be close to what was in the previous draft. Since I didn't know 
the genesis of the language in the consolidation agreement, so I thought I 
would check with you first.

I eliminated 5 (a) because the contracts allow for partial termination.

Just a reminder that until the finance arrangements are fixed and the rules 
are clear, Enron can't incur any hard costs related to the Virginia Power 
deal.  This means Enron can't obligate itself to purchase any equipment or 
materials, or enter into any services agreements except for studies, etc.

I will try to get some clarification on what can be done at this point, and 
will pass it along as soon as possible.

Kay

Hi Jo,

I left you a voice mail, but being an email addict I thought I would send you 
a note as well.  

Our son, Michael is in a Montessori kindergarten, which we have decided may 
not be most suitable for him.  We discussed it with Vivian Shudde, and she 
suggested that I give you a call about the Grace School.  

My husband and I would like to visit Grace.  We are wondering if it might be 
possible to visit tomorrow.  Please let me know what you think.

Thanks,

Kay Mann

     I decided to go ahead and draft the Consignment Agreement in the
     interest of saving time. I'll send you a copy later today, but I
     thought you might want to let Bob know so we don't duplicate efforts.
     The Agreement will generally follow the form of the Mitsubishi
     agreement.

yes.

Is this the SOTW report you requested? NN

He's doing great today.  He's here with me.  He just attended a meeting with 
Ozzier, Heather, Herman and Sheila.

Kay, I'm at home.  How's Michael?  Suz

Sounds good.  Early in the week is better for me.

Can we get together next week so I can get an update? Twanda will schedule.

There's a meeting with a cast of characters to discuss the Westinhouse 
warranty issues.  It is tomorrow (Thurs) at 1230.  Do you have any interest 
in sitting in?

Kay
John Normand@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
08/23/2000 01:03 PM
The proposed agenda for tomorrow's meeting is as follow:

Low frequency sound issue
Megawatt limit @ 182 Mw
Use of evap cooler
Heat Rate deficiency
Late equipment deliveries 

We can also talk about Wheatland performance.

Let me know if there is anything else we need to add to the agenda.

Thanks,   John

Here's a suggestion for the equipment question:

ENA and its affiliates have contractual rights to numerous turbines, several 
of which can satisfy the technical and scheduling requirements of this 
project, and some of which are already manufactured.  In the case of turbines 
still in the manufacturing process, ENA has firm commitments for delivery, 
backed by liquidated damages clauses and other financial incentives.

I have received material from Reagan in response to Question No. 5--thanks.
Reagan, do you have problems providing the total project cost under seal?
We can file as is, but I expect the public Staff will want to follow up.
Also, we do have the cost data, and are filing that under seal.  I have
indicated that we will file the supporting documentation next Tuesday.   The
only thing we are awaiting to day is the paragraph explaining that turbines
are indeed available. 

I did want to call your attention to the fact that I took a sentence out of
the response to No. 17 regarding Enron's intent to operate the plant as a
merchant facility after the expiration of the PPA.  You have been very
straightforward about that and it is clear from the rest of the answer.
However, given the Commission's skittishness about merchant facilities, I
would rather not highlight it.

We would like to file the responses by the end of the day, with the
exception of the supporting documentation on the cost data.

Attached is the latest draft of our responses to the Public Staff's data
requests.  Please let us know of any suggested revisions or other comments
you may have.  Once cost data (Request No. 1), other facility data (Request
No. 5) and some more information regarding the turbine purchase source
(Request No. 11) is received, we will file the responses shortly thereafter.
Intervention deadline is Sept. 8.

We did just a few minor edits of what John and Heather e-mailed to us --
nothing substantive.

Question:  Do you need us to set up "Edgecombe Development Co., LLC" here as
a NC LLC?  Just let me know.  We have some folks that can do that for you
quite efficiently.

Look forward to your comments.  Thank you.

not see these docs.

Hello again,

If these contracts are going to be assigned immediately to Mitsui, isn't the 
issue of a guaranty a Mitsui issue? Is this addressed in the EPC contracts?

If an Enron entity must give a guaranty, I would think we would want ENA to 
give it, to be replaced by a Mitsui guaranty unless we have some safeguard 
against the possibility of paying Mitsui and Mitsui not paying GE, so that we 
would have to pay twice.

Kay

Brian,
Thanks.  The changes to the on & off-shore contracts are OK.
I have replied to an e-mail from Kay concerning the "letter agreement", of
earlier today.  As far as I am concerned, we are ready to go there (you were
copied).
Kay indicated that the consolidation agreement would be today's focus of
attention.  I have not seen any feedback pursuant to my 1/Jun/00 e-mail.  
    <<Enron Monterrey/Vitro>> 
Your comment about the parent company guaranty reminds me that the above
e-mail also called for such a guaranty from Enron, as Enron NA is no longer
the purchaser.
Regards,
Jeff Smith

 << File: VITRO5-on-r1e.wpd >> << File: VITRO5-off-r1e.wpd >> 

Jeff:  I have picked up the changes to Section 5.2.2 per the email exchange
by
Tim and Jeff B.

Please note that Jeff B. condition that a parent guarantee be provided has
been
picked up in Section 3.7 and Exhibit C-1 has been modified to show General
Electric Company as the parent.

These are the final versions to date:

(See attached file: VITRO5-on-r1e.wpd)(See attached file:
VITRO5-off-r1e.wpd)

Jeff Smith:  PS  Kay Mann said she would close up the Consolidation
Agreement
discussions with you too.

Brian,
Here are my comments on several items.  
*   The consolidation agreement.
*   In 1.b, thanks for reflecting the GE suggestion.  However, near the
end of the paragraph, the word "remedy" should move to immediately after
"exclusive".
*   In 8, the reference should be to paragraph 10.a, not 11.a.
*   In 10.a, it does not look like the wording in my 30/May/00 e-mail
was picked up.
*   In 12 and 13, Enron has added new wording since the preceding
issuance of this document.
*   In 13, is all of this wording necessary and applicable.  At the end
of the first long sentence, the word "turnkey" is used.  Of course, this is
an equipment supply contract for GE.  
         Also, I believe the contracts do state what is in GE
scope via clauses 1.27, 1.86 and 3.1.  So, the last sentence is redundant.
*   More importantly, these two clauses could be interpreted as
establishing a GEPS/GEIOC consortium.  This is something GE had advocated as
the approach in as single contract for tax purposes in Mexico.  GE can still
go either way, although the single document approach is more straightforward
(and that is what we initialed in your offices last month).  Enron wanted
split contracts.  These clauses may undo what Enron was attempting to
achieve in this regard.
*   In 14, which has been added by Enron in the latest version of the
consolidation agreement, the GE entities seem to be prevented from getting
an extension of time under one contract if there is a problem with
performance under the other.  This is contrary to the words in the former
Enron clause 5, which has now been eliminated.  This clause 14 should be
removed. 
*   Regarding the "swap" payments for tax purposes, to benefit both
Enron and GE:
*   The amount paid to date on the Monterrey unit, under the MOU, is
$25,101,733.  What GE proposes it to:
*   Revise the payment schedule for the contracts such that payments
totaling this amount are due 2-3 days after contract signing.
*   Execute a separate letter, to be signed at the same time as the
contracts, formally dissolving the MOU.  The letter would call for GE to
refund this same amount 2-3 days after receipt of the payment under the
contracts.
            We need to draft this letter, which will
hopefully be one page.  The text of such a letter could include the
following wording:
            "Pursuant to clause 30.3 of the now executed
On and Off Shore contracts for this project, the MOU dated ______ is made
null and void.  Once the initial payment(s) called for in said contracts
have been made, the monies in the amount of $25,101,733.00, which were paid
under the MOU will be refunded to (Enron entity)." 
*   This would get the monies to the appropriate Enron and GE entities.

      In a related matter, since the legal Enron entity has
changed, GE requests a parent guarantee (using form already shown in the
contract(s)).
Regards,
Jeff Smith

 << File: Mac Word 3.0 >> 

Kay and Jeff:

Please review and comment.  Kay's comments are included and do not look
unreasonable.  Jeff please edit this document and send back to Kay and I to
see
what you are thinking about in the clause that used to be 11, now 10, I
think.

(See attached file: GE Vitro WRAP rev 2.doc)

Here are my comments to the draft response:

4.  I'm a bit troubled by the first sentence, since I really don't know what 
may have been on the drawing board earlier.  Maybe someone else can vouch for 
this statement. Otherwise, I suggest deleting it.

17.  The reference to NC Power utilizing the plant should be Applicant (third 
sentence).

18.  I would change the second sentence to begin "It is intended that the 
plant will be designed, constructed and operated...."

Hi there,

We've had about 15 minutes of rain, I think.  Just enough to keep the 
mosquitos happy!

Hi Sweetheart. Yes we did get a little rain this morning.Just glad to get
some,at least we won't have to water today.A nice high tide but they had
sold out of bait when Dad went down. It is great that Charlotte will be
able to visit with Michael tonight. Hope you and Neil have fun at the
party. I bet it was a thrill to see Sammy hit the home run. I guess Paige

Don't give up! There may be a way to get this done.

Kay:

I have to get going with the Site Development Plan effort and Geotech work.  
From your email it sounds like I will be unable to do that.  If this is true 
that is likely to delay us a bit (approx. 3 - 4 weeks).

Please advise,

Hi Gerry,

Enron is a great place for an engineer to work in a non-technical position.  
In fact, I work with reformed engineers daily, in various capacities.  

Enron has an analyst program for college graduates, where the analysts go 
through six month rotations in various parts of the business. In addition, 
there is a good job search feature on Enron's website.  If you see something 
that looks promising, I'll check things out around here to see if I can get 
the inside scoop.  

Hope to see you soon,

Kay

I'm hearing rumblings about the need to perform various preliminary tasks 
(survey work, etc.).  I've given the admonition to avoid incurring hard costs 
until the financing/accounting treatment has come together.  That lead to the 
question of what is a hard cost.  I know construction/equipment obligations 
are problems, studies generally ok.  This leads me to the conclusion that a 
geotechnical survey would be ok.  Am I safe here?

Thanks,

Kay

Karen,

Both Lisa Bills and Rose Engeldorf are out of town this week, which means we 
don't have all the players from Global Finance available.  Humberto (can't 
remember how to spell his last name) from Global Finance/ENA may be 
available, and he has participated in similar discussions on two other 
projects.  At some point he will need to be involved.  

The time is fine with me.

On and Off Shore contracts for this project, the MOU dated ______ is made
null and void.  Once the initial payment(s) called for in said contracts
have been made, the monies in the amount of $25,101,733.00, which were paid
under the MOU will be refunded to (Enron entity)." 
*   This would get the monies to the appropriate Enron and GE entities.

      In a related matter, since the legal Enron entity has
changed, GE requests a parent guarantee (using form already shown in the
contract(s)).

Please review and comment.  Kay's comments are included and do not look
unreasonable.  Jeff please edit this document and send back to Kay and I to

what you are thinking about in the clause that used to be 11, now 10, I
think.

Hi Nancy,

This should do it.

Hi Matt,

ENA is selling some of the LM6000's to ESA.  Will you be the ENA Tax Man on 
the deal?  

Thanks,

Kay,
 Attached is the LM 6000 and options scope that ESA has prepared, that will 
be input to our MOU.  It does not reflect the scope of equipment that will be 
procured from ABB yet; this should be forthcoming.  Also below is the current 
cost estimate of the machines with their S&S options and the ABB scope.  
Please let us know what other information regarding scope that you might 
need.  

Thanks,
Kevin
Chris, attached is the total scope to S&S.  From this list you should be able 
to make your change order to S&S base on purchased quantities versus required 
quantities.  I have provided you the required quantities.  
I provided you a column for the delta cost to S&S.  When you are finished, 
please complete the spreadsheet for all of our records.  I do not know how we 
are to add cost for storage either.
Thanks,
John

Here are the total cost for the S&S scope of supply for the Electrobolt 
Project.  I have not included any ENA burdens or storage cost.  These cost 
are from purchase order with ENA to S&S.
                                                                              
                                                                              
     EIGHT MACHINES               EACH
The total cost of the LM 6000's, sprint package, water injection 
skid                = $112,855,600  or $14,106,950 each
The total cost of options (chillers stacks, cooling tower, mod. buildings, 
etc. =     13,309,400  or      1,663,675 each
                                                                              
                                               Totals                = $ 
126,165,000 or   $15,770,625 each

The transformers from ABB in Brazil should cost $3,200,000. total in Brazil 
without shipping to the site.     

Hope this helps you with the WLB bucket.
John

Reagan,

Just to clarify, we intend to assign the land option to Rocky Mount, they buy 
it and lease the land to us once they own it/annex it/zone it.

In preparation for the Wednesday North Carolina Utility Commission Staff 
meeting (1 pm Houston time), we are aware of at least the following 3 issues 
that the staff are interested in discussing (most knowledgeable ENRONers 
listed in parentheses):

Status of the gas deal (John Hodge),
Status of annexation (Heather, Ozzie, Jeffrey), and
Status of VEPCO PPA (Heather, Ozzie).

Jeffrey left Bill Sherk a message (August 28, 2000) regarding site layout, 
landuse permitting/zoning, and annexation.  Once Bill calls back, Jeffrey 
will be able to comment further on the process/progress.  Heather and 
Ozzie--is it OK to tell the staff that we intend to buy the land, deed it to 
the City of Rocky Mount, and they subsequently annex?

Allyson Duncan indicates that this is a proactive meeting and the staff will 
not be confrontational or adversarial.

Please give feedback on these issues and any others including related 
conference call discussion by noon on Tuesday so that everyone can be 
prepared.

Thanks for your help,

Reagan Rorschach

Just in case you haven't seen a copy, NCNG has filed a petition to intervene 
in the CPCN proceeding.  The reason stated is that it isn't clear who is 
providing the natural gas.  It has asked for the right to examine and 
cross-examine witnesses, to file briefs and argue its position, etc.

Kay

Allyson,

Please delete Stuart Zisman and add me to your distribution list.

Thanks,

No problem.  

thanks.

I talked with Gisele Rankin, attorney for the Public Staff, about tomorrow's
meeting/conference call.  The Public Staff has not completed its review of
the material we filed on Friday, but, as I suggested to you yesterday,
Jeffrey, they will have questions about the PPA with VEPCO, gas supply and
annexation issues, and follow up cost data.  Gisele said they will also have
questions about a recent report regarding Enron's plans to build a 144MW
pure merchant facility in North Carolina to go on line next summer.  If she
thinks of anything else she will let me know.

I expect the following people from the Public Staff to be present:  Gisele
Rankin, attorney; Dennis Nightingale, engineer and head of the Electric
Division; Tom Lam, engineer and member of the Electric Division; Mike Maness
and Elise Cox from Accounting, and Tom Farmer or Calvin Craig from Economic
Research.  In other words, it will be crowded.

Gregg:

We should register Midwest Energy Hub, L.L.C. ("Midwest") for Sales & Use Tax 
in those states in which Midwest has nexus.  Nexus requires a physical 
presence (employees or inventory).  If Midwest, in foreign states (outside of 
Illinois), is merely purchasing and selling natural gas, for delivery by 
common carrier; Midwest does not have nexus.  Rather, Midwest is acting much 
like a mail order seller.  

In light of the above, could you please advise regarding Midwest's physical 
presence in Iowa, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Oklahoma, Texas and 
Wisconsin.  Thanks.

- Matt

Matt - Per our conversation today, the following e-mail was sent by Russell 
Murrell regarding the impending name change of Midwest Energy Hub, L.L.C.  My 
understanding is that we have already bought/sold natural gas in Oklahoma, 
Texas, and Louisianna.  The remaining states in his e-mail are potential 
future places of business.  I will leave it up to your discretion as to how 
you want to pursue registering for taxes in these locales.  I am guessing we 
may want to register in those states we have already transacted in.  Please 
let me know what you think we should do.

Thanks,

Gregg

_______________________________________________________________

Here are my comments re Peoples' mark-up:
                                         1. Sects. 1.1, 1.11, 10.2, and
15.1(f). The combined effect of the proposed changes to these sections is
to significantly broaden the terminantion right in the event that
governmental action related to the agreement is modified in a manner
unacceptable to either party. As changed the unacceptable approval can come
at any time during the term of the agreement, and need not  involve
approval  "required" for the agreement to remain effective. Peoples did not
propose to include language from the comparable NIGAS Hub Agreement which
refers to adverse "rate approval". However, Peoples' intent may be to
obtain a termination remedy in the event of an adverse rate-making decision
re the treatment of Hub revenues. In any event, the meaning of a
termination right triggered if a government approval (not necessarily
required for the agreement to remain in effect) is modified "in any manner
which is unacceptable" is, at best, unclear. We should try to stay with the
original language (or, perhaps, limit expansion of the termination right to
circumstances when a "required" approval is revoked.) While the broadened
termination right proposed by Peoples is available to either party, I
wouldn't think it likely that MEH would wish to terminate as a result of a
modified regualtory decision not required for continuation of the agency
arrangement.
2. Sects. 1.6, 7.1. 2.2, 2.10 (comments re cumulative net revenue
definition) As modified, MEH is charged with the duty to market Hub
Serivces, which includes Extended Hub Serivces (Def'n. 1.17). However, the
proposed Adminisatrative Service Fee (7.1) is only payable during the term
of the Agreement. MEH, therefore, is required by the Agreement to market
extended Hub Services, but receives no compensation (after termination of
the Agreement) for doing so. Also, Peoples proposes to add provision (C)
eliminating refund amounts from the definition of Cumulative Net Revenue.
Apparently in conjuction with this, Peoples proposes to delete the last
sentence of 1.6 which requires a retroactive adjustment of cumulative net
revenue in the event of a refund. Peoples also has bracketed 7.3,
apparently intending to exclude it. I suppose this is fine from MEH's
perspective. The effect of these changes is to deduct only amounts actually
refunded from the revenue base for the administrative fee, and not require
a retroactive adjustment. This could benefit MEH if the agreement
terminates before a refund is required. No retroactive adjustment would be
needed.
3. Sect. 1.9, 2.5. Peoples proposes to delete the requirement that it make
nominating or scheduling changes on interstate pipelines for receipt or
delivery of gas needed for hub transactions or delivery of gas at a
secondary point for displacement delivery. Northern Illinois Gas Co. did
agree to these provision in the contract with its Hub Agent. I do not know
the value of these commitments to MEH from a business standpoint.
                         4. Sect. 1.13. Peoples proposes that the GTC be
defined to included changes made by Peoples in its sole discretion.
Peoples, however, is not free to change the GTC as it sees fit. FERC may
elect to allow changes proposed by Peoples to become effective, but Peoples
can, at most, "propose" changes in its sole discretion. How about: "the
effective general Terms and Conditions of the Operating Statament as may be
modified from time to time." Sect. 6.1 gives Peoples a right to propose
changes to the GTC, so there is no need to cover that here.
                              5. Sect. 1.17. The GTC does not indicate that
Parking and Loaning Service must be interruptible. I will review this
further.                      6. Sect. 2.2. Peoples has modified the
language giving it responsibility to ensure compliance with the GTC to
assign this obligation to both parties. The intent was to comply with
requirements of FERC orders indicating that an agent need not be
certificated as a "natural gas company", if there is another entity with
clear responponsibilty to ensure compliance with the Natural Gas Act and
FERC regulations. I suggest we stay with the origianl language indicating
that Peoples, the certificate holder, has the responsibility to ensure
compliance with regulatory requirements.
          7. Sect. 2.4b The thrid sentence is confusing in light of the
sending sentence indicating that MEH must consent to a change in
information re firm capacity. Perhaps "in its sole discretion" can be
delted and the last word of the third sentence changed to "appropriate".
                              8. Sect. 2.5. New Item 3 of the list of
grounds for refusal should be deleted. The GTC (Sect. 8.2) specifies the
grounds on which Hub Serivce can be denied. The Agency Agreement should not
add to this. Also, the GTC expressly requires that firm serivce provided
under the Operating Statement and firm serivce under peoples' Illiniois
tariffs have equal scheduling priority.
                                   9. Sect. 2.10. This Section places the
risk of non-payment on MEH, unless Peoples conducts the credit check. This
is how risk was allocated in the NIGAS Hub Agreement. That agreement,
however, provided for a 50/50 split of Hub revenue. As proposed by Peoples,
MEH would receive only an agency fee and lesser percentage of revenue. With
the changed allocation of revenue, a changed allocation of non-payment risk
also may be appropriate. Normally, the this risk should follow
responsibility for accepting the transaction. At a minimum, non-payment
risk should be assigned to Peoples if (i) it performs the credit check; or
(ii) requires MEH to accept a Hub customer which MEH has rejected based on
a credit analysis conducted under the GTC (Sect. 8.2).
     10. Sect. 3.3. The required refunds could be large relative to the
administrative fee. The revised language requires MEH to finance refunds
for ten business days. Should there be an interest component?
                                                        11. Sect. 3.4. This
Section suggests that MEH will receive a fee for Extended Hub Services. I'm
don't see how this occurs under the revised language.   12. Sect. 3.5.
Peoples proposes to delete the language requiring best efforts to minimize
imbalances. Compliance filings due this summer under FERC Order 637 are
expected to offer incentives related to avoidance of imbalances and Peoples
should attempt to use these procedures. We should discuss this with them on
Wed.
                    13. Sect. 5.1. Peoples has modified the warranties to
indicate consistency of the Agency Agreement with "material" contractcs and
Judgments or Laws not expected to have a material adverse effect. Is it
suffucuent to have minor contract violations and inconsistency with some
Laws/Judgments?               14. Sect. 7.1 The NIGAS Hub Agreement did not
have a flat fee component.
15. Sect. 10.1. Because the Governmental Approval must be acceptable to
both Peoples and MEH, People should not have "sole" authority to prepare
and file all applications.
                                         16. Sect. 10.2. See comments above
re Governmental Approval. Also, I don't think there is a need for the word
"expressly" in the first sentence.            17. Sect. 11.1. Should the
Section require consent for transfer by operation of law if we wish to have
this requirement in the event that the Hub facilities are sold?

          18. Sect. 15.1 (a). If this type of provision is going to be
included, should there at least be an initial period (say a year) to get
started which doesn't trigger a termination right? The NIGAS Agreement had
a section along these lines.
          19. Sect. 15.1 (f). See comments above re Governmental Approval.
                                                   20. Former 15.1 (f) now
deleted. This provided that the Agency Agreement could be terminated is MEH
is dissolved. This seems necessary to me.          21. 15.1 (g) Peoples
wishes to have sole discretion to change its Facilities or the GTC, but
proposes to limit MEH's termination right in the event that such a change
impairs the HUB's marketability. It seems reasonably to allow MEH to
terminate if it believes that HUB marketability is impaired, without a need
to demonstrate reasonableness.
                                         22. Sect. 17.1 I don't understand
why Peoples wishes to require confidentiality for the compensation
sections. The Illinois Commission Staff and interested parties would have
access to this information under a protective agreement. This would
unnecessarily complicate the approval process and I don't know what there
is to gain from secrecy. These provisions were part of the public record in
the NIGAS approval case.                                     That's all.
Let's discuss tomorrow.

I like this answer.

Matt - Thanks for the explanation.  That makes life much simpler, at least 
for now.  Illinois is currently the only state where we have employees or 
inventory.  We are merely purchasing and selling natural gas in the other 
locations.  If that changes in the future, I will let you know.

As always - thanks for your thorough review,

Gregg

Gregg:

We should register Midwest Energy Hub, L.L.C. ("Midwest") for Sales & Use Tax 
in those states in which Midwest has nexus.  Nexus requires a physical 
presence (employees or inventory).  If Midwest, in foreign states (outside of 
Illinois), is merely purchasing and selling natural gas, for delivery by

like a mail order seller.  

In light of the above, could you please advise regarding Midwest's physical

 2.  Availability %'s, penalties & bonuses ($ amounts and caps)
 3.  ComEd schedule change limitations
 4.  Project Update section - removal of Event of Default language
 5.  Early completion bonus ($ amount and cap)

Please review this ComEd term sheet and forward me any additional comments.

I am forwarding a copy of this term sheet to Kay Mann for her review.  I left 
her a voicemail letting her know that this term sheet format was developed 
earlier this year with legal input from Stuart Zisman.

I would like to be a position to send this term sheet to ComEd sometime 
tomorrow (8/29).  

This document should also serve as a template for the term sheet which I will 
be preparing to send to the wholesale energy group at Wisconsin Electric 
regarding a PPA from the Plano site.  I would like to have that document 
ready by Wednesday-Thursday of this week.  I will send you the first version 
of this WEPCO document either later today or tomorrow morning.

Call/see me to discuss any of this information.

Fred

I'm keeping this one.  Too cool!

 Isn't it nice to know he is looking out for you?  You can tell how much he 
cares about you.

Thanks for sharing the stories.  I really enjoy each one of them.

This should be the final (or at least almost final) version.  The amounts are 
correct.

FYI

John -

Have spoke with Mitch and he and I agree that he, Ross Newlin and myself 
should go along with Bill Fox if he's available (Bob Greene if he's not).  
Our preference is to go on Sept 11 and return same day if possible, return 
the 12th if not.  Let us know if this works for EECC and SWPC.

I heard from Westinhouse today concerning the sound, missing megawatts, and 
heat rate issues, and the possibility of a meeting to discuss how we are 
going to work together on these issues.  Matt Coffman, S/WEC suggested that 
the meeting be held in Orlando and that it be held on Friday, 8 Sep 00, or 
early the following week (11, 12, or 13 Sep 00).  Please let me know your 
availability and I will set up the meeting.  I think that this meeting should 
be held without lawyers.

Thanks,   John

Chris/Ben,

We had discussed having two change orders so that the ESA stuff is easily 
identifiable/assignable/etc.  Is this still the plan?

Kay

   
	
	

In addition, the dual fuel cost will be split between ESA and ENA ($280,000 
to ENA and $280,000 to ESA).

Chris
	
	

Kathy and Kay,

I have revised change order #2 to account for the additional scope added by 
ESA.  Please review  and comment.  I did not change the effective date.

For information purposes, all but item "b" are attributed to ESA.

I'm far afield of my area of expertise, but Boyd's comments make a great deal 
of sense to me.  Gregg, did you/will you pass these along to PERC?  Perhaps 
it would help if Boyd could speak directly to the PERC person with the

_______________________________________________________________

These are my comments re the draft Petition forwarded by Peoples on Friday:
(1) The Petition describes PERC in paragraph and refers to PERC in par. 3.
PERC, however, is not a party to the Master Agreement, and the Petition
does not discuss request any relief with respect to PERC. I don't see why
there is a need to reference PERC. (2) It is my understanding that, under
the Master Agreement, there will be two types of transactions: (a) simple
buy/sells at a clear market price; and (b) complex transactions with
sharing arrangements, management fees and similar structures. As we have
discussed, the first type of transaction, simple buy/sells at a market
price fall under an exemption to Section 7-101's approval requirement (220
ILCS 5/7-101(4)). These types of transactions do  not require ICC approval
and MEH/Peoples are free to engage in such transaction now. I would suggest
that the Petition point this out, particularly if (as I suspect is the
case) MEH and Peoples are now conducting such transactions or may wish to
do so before the ICC acts on the Master Agreement. Because the Master
Agreement covers certain transaction which need approval and other which do
not, I would suggest that the Petition make this clear and request approval
only "to the extent required". (This was the language used by NIGAS in
seeking approval of a buy/sell agreement in Docket 95-0302.) (3) With
respect to the transactions which do require approval (the complex ones
with sharing arrangements, management fees and similar structures), the
draft Petition doesn't say much. It says (Par. 5) that transactions under
the Agreement will optimize the use of the gas supply and capacity assets
of Peoples and MEH; (Par. 9) that Peoples has similar master contracts with
non-affiliated entities; (par. 10) that the agreement will not interfere
with Peoples' operations; and (par. 10) that the Agreement is in the best
interest of Peoples and its customers. All of these statements are fine to
include, but the ICC is likely to want to know more about why the agreement
is in the public interest. Perhaps a sentence or two could explain how the
Agreement will optimize Peoples' use of its gas supply and capacity assets
(e.g., by using capacity which otherwise would be idle) and how this will
benefit Peoples' Illinois ratepayers (e.g., a credit to PGA gas costs).
Also, Peoples is asking that the ICC pre-approve an arrangement under which
the "details" of individual transactions will be filled in later. As I
understand it, the "details" will include such things as the level of
management fees and other compensation terms. To facilitate approval, it
would be best to have some sort of guideline to suggest to the ICC, i.e., a
management fee within a certain amount or percentage of a specified index
level. If there is an industry standard approach that could be referenced,
that may be of use. The Petition suggests that there are other Agreements
of this type with non-affiliates. Perhaps reference could be made to
pricing provisions under one or more of those agreements. If it is not
possible to be any more specific, I am concerned that the ICC may want to
wait and review individual transaction rather than giving blanket approval
without knowing more. (4) The ICC approval process can take 4-5 months
(sometimes more) to complete. The required approval time, however, can be
cut down significantly when the apprval filing includes a Peition and
supporting testimony that lays out all the information needed to conclude
that a proposed arrangement is in the public interest (the interest of
Illinois ratepayers). The Petition itself need not include all the details
(it need only lay out the case ingeneral terms). A filing package which,
with accompanying testimony, tells the full story will expedite the
approval process.

Kevin,

What issues were invented?

06/02/2000 01:28 PM
Jeff and Reynaldo Garcia spoke on this subject at length, and Rey convinced 
Jeff that spitting was necessary.  AT that time the Enron Contracting entity 
was not specified to be Energia...    If you want to unsplit the documents it 
will add additional time in excess geting a consolidation agreement completed 
I think.  Please include Rey in your quest for closure.  PS  GE is now OK 
with the split.

I need help getting closure on the Consolidation Agreement.  I hope that we 
do not invent other issues as well.

On further review, I don't think we need to challenge the proposed
reference to Parking and Loaning Transactions as being "interruptible".
Although Peoples' GTC does not characterize this service as interruptible,
there are provisions in the GTC re scheduling and priority that render the
service interruptible, e.g. Sect. 6.3.

Hi Ben,

I've started a draft of the ESA document, and I wanted to get your comments 
before I go much further.  Basically, I want to make sure  I'm on the right 
track.

I'll make it look pretty as we go along.  Getting the deal points are most 
important at this point.  

Thanks,

by Midwest and I have a couple of questions about how our docs will be used, 
whether Midwest will be competing with us and who will be negotiating hedge 
agreements on behalf of Midwest (i.e., will ENA swap lawyers be involved?).  
Please call me so that I can comply with Greg's request..

Hi there,

Paige is still here.  I think she may leave tomorrow.  Have you ever visited 
her website?  Here's a link:
http://www.southwestern.edu/~recordp/

You might trying clicking on the link to see if it takes you directly to her 
web page.  She will have the same email address again this year.  I suspect 
she will have the same mailing address as well, since it is a box number.  

Michael slept well this weekend.  He had a great birthday.  He takes his 
dinosaur everywhere.  It is so funny, because the button gets pushed 
accidently when it is being hauled around, so it is constantly growling.

We saw a few drops of rain, but nothing to help the water bill.  The smog is 
horrible.

I'm in town all week this week, which is nice.  Neil and I have a birthday 
party to go to for our neighbor Donnie (he was at the party) on Friday, so 
Michael will spend some time with Charlotte again. She should be off of most 
of her restrictions tomorrow, so maybe he will get to see her more.  

We went to the Astros game last night, and they actually won.  Sammy Sosa hit 
a home run harder than any I've seen before.  Even some of the Astros fans 
clapped at the sheer force of it.  The pitcher said he watched it, just 
because he had never seen such an awesome hit.  

Too bad about the heat, but what the heck can you do about it anyway?

Love,

Kay

Bill and Rita McCall <bmccall@wcnet.net> on 08/22/2000 10:17:25 AM
Hi Kay Kay,Just wanted to say Hi. Did Houston really see rain today? We had
about five drops. We have had a nice quiet week. We did buy five pounds of
shrimp from Grassy Point. Has Michael rested up from this birthday party?
We plan to be here until sometime next week. Has Paige gone back to school
and will she still have the same email address? Tell neil Dad will sent a
fishing report when he has one. He really has not fished much. It's just to
hot. Love,Mother

I asked you yesterday if you knew the execution date for the Edgecombe

also need to know the execution date for the Hartwell (Hart County, GA) 
Contract.  Bart Clark thought that you were the person to talk to for that.  
Could you please let me know what those execution dates are, or, if you are 
not working on the GA sites, could you point me in the right direction?

Thanks,

Per my voice mail, will you please take a quick look at my edits to Vlady's 
draft risk management policy attached below.  I don't think any of them are 
problematic, but Vlady has some concerns mainly because the base Enron Corp. 
risk management policy was used as the template and therefore I am 
effectively making edits to it.

I will be leaving the office today around 11:00 so I want to turn this to 
Peoples before then if possible.  On any other business, I will be 
unavailable from 1:30 to probably 3:00 today, but can be reached via pager 
800-980-1771 or cell phone 312-925-8888 at any other time.

As always - thanks for your help.

Some comments on your comments:

Section II: I don't like the title "Commercial Development Manager" but 
rather "Risk Manager" 
Response:         The title Commercial Development Manager comes from the MEH 
Operating Agreement.  We can amend the LLC Agreement  if necessary, but it 
seems burdensome since the title is only a formality.  However, as currently 
written, the Commercial Development Manager is the person responsible for 
managing the daily business, i.e. similar to a desk director.  In order to 
maintain control of this position, it can only be filled by an Enron nominee 
and will report directly to the MEH General Manager, Laura Luce of Enron.

Section VII: Majority of the wording came initially from attorneys, I would 
recommend confirming that.
Response:          I will run this by the attorneys.  However, from a 
technical perspective, Section VII refers to employees of MEH.  No one in the 
Chicago office is an employee of MEH, but rather we all remained employees of 
our respective organizations.  I will ask the attorneys if we need to limit 
Section VIII: Who is the General Manager of MEH?
Response:          As mentioned above, Laura Luce, Vice President of Enron 
North America
Let me know if any of my responses don't make sense or you still have any 
questions.  I am still going to try to get this out by 10:00 or so.

Vlady.

   
	
	

Vlady - As we discussed, I am attaching my revisions to your initial draft.  
They are mainly cosmetic attempts to make the RM Policy terms consistent with 
the MEH Operating Agreement and separate MEH from any behind the scenes 
reporting or controls that ENA chooses to place on Richard/MEH.  Let me know 
if you have any concerns about my edits.  I would like to send this to 
Peoples end of day today.  I will follow up with Structuring to find a body 
to model the underlying asset position.  

Thanks - Gregg

Kay, I talked with Mark Shaffer in our Atlanta office;  he has no

Since the time frame is short, I wanted to give you an outline to mark 
up/correct.

Here's how I understand the deal:

People's has the Manlove gas storage facility.  We have presented to People's 
a nonphysical method to monetize it, similar to what was done with Bammel.  
Since this is a regulated asset, regulatory approval will be required, and 
the consumers will receive part of the benefit of the monetization.  The 
essence of our deal is that Enron will receive 50% of the net earnings, up to 
$25mm, as our fee.  In consideration for this fee, Enron takes the financial, 
legal, accounting and engineering lead. Peoples and Enron will work together 
on the regulatory strategy formulation and implementation.

We want to present a draft MOU to Peoples this week.  The basic goals are:

Define scope of the agreement
Define our lead role in the 4 stated areas
Create exclusivity for Enron 
Define financial arrangements (cost/profit)
Get an acknowledgement that what was presented to them was proprietary, and 
covered by our confidentiality agreement.
Define term (5 years) 

Each party bears their own internal costs, and third party costs are split 
50/50, with prior approval.  In that regard an immediate concern is getting 
the engineering work kicked off.  

We want the agreement broad enough to cover physical withdrawals.  We do not 
want it specific to this field, since we want the benefit of the use of our 
methodology.

Please correct/supplement, etc.  

Thanks,

Kay

I lost the email with the information regarding where to send donations in 
Gabrielle's honor.  Can you resend it to me?  Thanks.

I wanted to make sure that everyone is happy with the name Edgecombe 
Development CO, LLC as the project company name. We are going to amend our 
petition for the CPCN, and I want to get the name right.

I am also a notary.

Jerry Fox reports that Peoples is reviewing the Peitition and plans to
generate a new draft. Jerry indicates that Peoples does not think it will
be possible to identify a standard or guideline which the ICC could
consider with respect to the "complex" transactions covered by the
agreement (for example, pricing within a designated percentage or amount of
an index level). Do you have any thoughts on this? The Petitiion is asking
that the ICC approve these transactions in advance, so it is best to
explain as fully as possible what the transactions will look like. Jerry is
also not sure what can be said about why these transaction benefit the
public (the standard for approval under 7-101).  I had assumed that the
transactions might use otherwise idle capacity or create a credit to gas
cost otherwise recoverable under the Illinois PGA. Jerry is still
considering this. Jerry reports that Mary Klyshaaf and others spoke to the
ICC Staff about this and suggested that the affiliate agreement should be
approved because transactions under it are similar to transactions
currently on-going with non-affiliates. Jerry, however, is uncertain about
the nature of these transactions. I suggested that one approach might be to
identlfy some of the referenced transactions to see what can be said about
why they are in the public interest. If you have any ideas on these points,
please let me know. Jerry seems to agree that the Petition would be
improved if information could be added to explain why transactions under
the agreement would be beneficial to Peoples' customers.

Hi Kay,

I'm looking for CA's with Peoples.  I have one dated December 23, 1998.  Do 
you have anything else, especially one more current?

Thanks,

Kay

Hi Cheryl,

I've been asked to see what I can find out about the status of the generator 
for the Westinghouse 501D.  I've heard stories ranging from it was on the 
Titantic, to it was in a rain storm.  Can you shed any light on its status?

Thanks,

Kay

Is everyone available on Friday to discuss where we are and where we are 
headed with the CPCN process? We need to discuss whether the petition 
can/should be amended to allow for a broader certificate.

Thanks,

Kay

I never got the email.  Please send it again.

Here's a first draft.  It isn't quite done, but I wanted to let you have a 
look at it ASAP.

Kay

For comment, etc.

Thanks,

Kay

A little light reading.  Another will follow.

_______________________________________________________________

Here are my comments re Peoples' mark-up:
                                         1. Sects. 1.1, 1.11, 10.2, and
15.1(f). The combined effect of the proposed changes to these sections is
to significantly broaden the terminantion right in the event that
governmental action related to the agreement is modified in a manner
unacceptable to either party. As changed the unacceptable approval can come
at any time during the term of the agreement, and need not  involve
approval  "required" for the agreement to remain effective. Peoples did not
propose to include language from the comparable NIGAS Hub Agreement which
refers to adverse "rate approval". However, Peoples' intent may be to
obtain a termination remedy in the event of an adverse rate-making decision
re the treatment of Hub revenues. In any event, the meaning of a
termination right triggered if a government approval (not necessarily
required for the agreement to remain in effect) is modified "in any manner
which is unacceptable" is, at best, unclear. We should try to stay with the
original language (or, perhaps, limit expansion of the termination right to
circumstances when a "required" approval is revoked.) While the broadened
termination right proposed by Peoples is available to either party, I
wouldn't think it likely that MEH would wish to terminate as a result of a
modified regualtory decision not required for continuation of the agency
arrangement.
2. Sects. 1.6, 7.1. 2.2, 2.10 (comments re cumulative net revenue
definition) As modified, MEH is charged with the duty to market Hub
Serivces, which includes Extended Hub Serivces (Def'n. 1.17). However, the
proposed Adminisatrative Service Fee (7.1) is only payable during the term
of the Agreement. MEH, therefore, is required by the Agreement to market
extended Hub Services, but receives no compensation (after termination of
the Agreement) for doing so. Also, Peoples proposes to add provision (C)
eliminating refund amounts from the definition of Cumulative Net Revenue.
Apparently in conjuction with this, Peoples proposes to delete the last
sentence of 1.6 which requires a retroactive adjustment of cumulative net
revenue in the event of a refund. Peoples also has bracketed 7.3,
apparently intending to exclude it. I suppose this is fine from MEH's
perspective. The effect of these changes is to deduct only amounts actually
refunded from the revenue base for the administrative fee, and not require
a retroactive adjustment. This could benefit MEH if the agreement
terminates before a refund is required. No retroactive adjustment would be
needed.
3. Sect. 1.9, 2.5. Peoples proposes to delete the requirement that it make
nominating or scheduling changes on interstate pipelines for receipt or
delivery of gas needed for hub transactions or delivery of gas at a
secondary point for displacement delivery. Northern Illinois Gas Co. did
agree to these provision in the contract with its Hub Agent. I do not know
the value of these commitments to MEH from a business standpoint.
                         4. Sect. 1.13. Peoples proposes that the GTC be
defined to included changes made by Peoples in its sole discretion.
Peoples, however, is not free to change the GTC as it sees fit. FERC may
elect to allow changes proposed by Peoples to become effective, but Peoples
can, at most, "propose" changes in its sole discretion. How about: "the
effective general Terms and Conditions of the Operating Statament as may be
modified from time to time." Sect. 6.1 gives Peoples a right to propose
changes to the GTC, so there is no need to cover that here.
                              5. Sect. 1.17. The GTC does not indicate that
Parking and Loaning Service must be interruptible. I will review this
further.                      6. Sect. 2.2. Peoples has modified the
language giving it responsibility to ensure compliance with the GTC to
assign this obligation to both parties. The intent was to comply with
requirements of FERC orders indicating that an agent need not be
certificated as a "natural gas company", if there is another entity with
clear responponsibilty to ensure compliance with the Natural Gas Act and
FERC regulations. I suggest we stay with the origianl language indicating
that Peoples, the certificate holder, has the responsibility to ensure
compliance with regulatory requirements.
          7. Sect. 2.4b The thrid sentence is confusing in light of the
sending sentence indicating that MEH must consent to a change in
information re firm capacity. Perhaps "in its sole discretion" can be
delted and the last word of the third sentence changed to "appropriate".
                              8. Sect. 2.5. New Item 3 of the list of
grounds for refusal should be deleted. The GTC (Sect. 8.2) specifies the
grounds on which Hub Serivce can be denied. The Agency Agreement should not
add to this. Also, the GTC expressly requires that firm serivce provided
under the Operating Statement and firm serivce under peoples' Illiniois
tariffs have equal scheduling priority.
                                   9. Sect. 2.10. This Section places the
risk of non-payment on MEH, unless Peoples conducts the credit check. This
is how risk was allocated in the NIGAS Hub Agreement. That agreement,
however, provided for a 50/50 split of Hub revenue. As proposed by Peoples,
MEH would receive only an agency fee and lesser percentage of revenue. With
the changed allocation of revenue, a changed allocation of non-payment risk
also may be appropriate. Normally, the this risk should follow
responsibility for accepting the transaction. At a minimum, non-payment
risk should be assigned to Peoples if (i) it performs the credit check; or
(ii) requires MEH to accept a Hub customer which MEH has rejected based on
a credit analysis conducted under the GTC (Sect. 8.2).
     10. Sect. 3.3. The required refunds could be large relative to the
administrative fee. The revised language requires MEH to finance refunds
for ten business days. Should there be an interest component?
                                                        11. Sect. 3.4. This
Section suggests that MEH will receive a fee for Extended Hub Services. I'm
don't see how this occurs under the revised language.   12. Sect. 3.5.
Peoples proposes to delete the language requiring best efforts to minimize
imbalances. Compliance filings due this summer under FERC Order 637 are
expected to offer incentives related to avoidance of imbalances and Peoples
should attempt to use these procedures. We should discuss this with them on
Wed.
                    13. Sect. 5.1. Peoples has modified the warranties to
indicate consistency of the Agency Agreement with "material" contractcs and
Judgments or Laws not expected to have a material adverse effect. Is it
suffucuent to have minor contract violations and inconsistency with some
Laws/Judgments?               14. Sect. 7.1 The NIGAS Hub Agreement did not
have a flat fee component.
15. Sect. 10.1. Because the Governmental Approval must be acceptable to
both Peoples and MEH, People should not have "sole" authority to prepare
and file all applications.
                                         16. Sect. 10.2. See comments above
re Governmental Approval. Also, I don't think there is a need for the word
"expressly" in the first sentence.            17. Sect. 11.1. Should the
Section require consent for transfer by operation of law if we wish to have
this requirement in the event that the Hub facilities are sold?

          18. Sect. 15.1 (a). If this type of provision is going to be
included, should there at least be an initial period (say a year) to get
started which doesn't trigger a termination right? The NIGAS Agreement had
a section along these lines.
          19. Sect. 15.1 (f). See comments above re Governmental Approval.
                                                   20. Former 15.1 (f) now
deleted. This provided that the Agency Agreement could be terminated is MEH
is dissolved. This seems necessary to me.          21. 15.1 (g) Peoples
wishes to have sole discretion to change its Facilities or the GTC, but
proposes to limit MEH's termination right in the event that such a change
impairs the HUB's marketability. It seems reasonably to allow MEH to
terminate if it believes that HUB marketability is impaired, without a need
to demonstrate reasonableness.
                                         22. Sect. 17.1 I don't understand
why Peoples wishes to require confidentiality for the compensation
sections. The Illinois Commission Staff and interested parties would have
access to this information under a protective agreement. This would
unnecessarily complicate the approval process and I don't know what there
is to gain from secrecy. These provisions were part of the public record in
the NIGAS approval case.                                     That's all.
Let's discuss tomorrow.

I am absolutely delighted.

Seyi,

James MacCallon has now left for Mexico.  I am just returning from India and
must step in where he left off.  I see James has sent a few emails and faxes 
to
you but I can find no reply from AA although there is a 14-July email from you
indicating a reply would be sent by 16-July.   Have you sent a reply and I 
have
missed it?

Given that the commercial team is now at a critical point and needs to
understand the Nigeria tax implications for the venture and bid, perhaps we
should short-cut this Q&A process and have a conference call.  I would suggest
early AM Tuesday 20th, what works for you?

During the call, John Rigby can provide background on the project then we can
discuss the questions James sent you earlier (12th, 16th-AM, 16th-PM).
Additionally, I would like to confirm whether the attached Nigeria Tax Chart
(TC-NIGE-Elf...) is still valid and touch on the below topics:

   Are construction activities conducted approx. 30-35 miles offshore Nigeria
   subject to Nigeria income tax if paid by a Nigerian client (i.e., Elf
   Petroleum Nigeria, Ltd.)?  I recall from advice AA provided 2nd 
quarter-1998
   there is an issue as to whether offshore construction services are 
"consumed"
   in Nigeria.
   The bid package suggest Elf will withhold taxes unless Contractor provides
   "official documents unquestionably enacting an exemption from any 
withholdng
   in connection with the Contract."  If the offshore Nigeria activities were
   outside Nigeria territorial waters, would it be possible to obtain such an
   exemption certification?
   Is it still necessary for a foreign company to form a Nigerian subsidiary 
to
   conduct business in Nigeria?  I recall that at one point Branches need
   special approval which was difficult to obtain but James informed me this 
has
   changed.
   Have you commonly seen Nigerian and non-Nigerian companies enter into
   consortiums or contractual joint ventures to execute a construction project
   in Nigeria?  Are there any special issues Enron should be aware of?
   In the past, a company subject to Nigeria net income tax may have fully
   satisfied its tax liability with advance taxes retained by its client.
   However, due to the lack of physical receipts,  there was no allowed credit
   for these advance taxes.  Is this still the case?  Are you familiar with
   contractual language used by the Contractor to protect his tax position and
   ensure receipts are provided in a timely manner?  Elf has suggested it 
would
   provide receipts "when they are received from the relevant Tax Authority" 
but
   this provides little (or no) comfort based on my prior dealings with 
Nigeria.
   The bid package language on VAT is somewhat troubling.  It suggests
   Contractor must furnish a copy of its VAT registration before issuing its
   first invoice.  It goes on to add that VAT which may be legally payable by
   Elf in respect of non-resident Contractor invoices "shall be paid and
   collected in accordance with the applicable Nigerian Tax laws and
   Regulations."  Can you confirm this would not allow Elf to withhold VAT 
from
   Contractor under a so called "reverse charge VAT" mechanism?

I look forward to hearing from you.  If wish to call me, my direct line is
713-345-6420.  My fax line is 713-646-7151.

Regards.

Hemmat,

In answer to your first question; yes, I am the Project Manager currently 
handling the Westinghouse 501D5A that is due to be complete in September 2000.

I was assigned to the project in late June 2000 and do not have any 
inspection, shipping / receipts, or etc. at this time.  I do have a QA/QC 
inspector on this project to ensure Enron and CALME get a quality turbine for 
their money.  I am also working on an AFE to cover the expenses of this work 
from July 2000 until the turbine is turned over to a dedicated project site.  
This cost will include proper storage of the GTG and inspections so we do not 
have another debacle like the Iuka, MS frame 6B's.  At the present, I 
anticipate the cost to be from $50,000 to $75,000 till the end of this year.  
Any money left over will be carried over into the following year or rebated 
when the turbine is turned over to a dedicated project site (i.e. CALME will 
only need to cover what is actually spent).

The only deviation to the contract that I am aware of is the change order for 
the duel fuel option.  I believe that other changes are being negotiated, but 
I am unaware of the content of those changes, if any, at this time. 

To begin the summary, the gas turbine is in the Houston, Texas Powerserve 
shop going through final assembly.  The turbine is expected to ship to the 
delivery point (Port of Houston) by mid to late September, 2000.  The 
generator is a different story. It was shipped from Nasan, South Korea on 8 
JUN 00.  It arrived in the Port of Houston on or about 23 JUL 00.  As the 
cargo ship was off-loading it's cargo, the ship listed to one side.  The crew 
went to re-balast the ship; however they did not close certain valves, or 
something to that effect, and flooded the cargo bay containing our 
generator.  When the mistake was realized, 19 inches of seawater was in and 
around the generator.  The water touched the parallel rings but not the core 
of the generator.  Talking with Lynn DeKrey, Westinghouse Project Manager, he 
informed us that Westinghouse engineering has declared the generator 
non-salvageable.  Lynn is currently gathering information so we can claim an 
insurable event occurred as well as trying to find us a generator as soon as 
possible. Lynn is also going to send an accident report so we may evaluate 
the damage as well. We have not accepted delivery of the generator and 
turbine; furthermore, title has not been transferred to Enron.  I have 
alerted Dan Shultz, Brian Barto, and Dwight Alexander of these events. 

In short, the Westinghouse 501D5A WILL NOT be available, as a GTG set, in 
September 2000.  Options to repair the generator were discussed with Lynn and 
it is estimated to take anywhere from six to twelve months and cost $3.5 to 
$5 million dollars.  The next option is to take delivery of an Erferd 
generator from Germany in late July, 2001.  The last option, which Lynn is 
currently working, is to supply a generator in sufficient time for a 
Commercial Operation Date of June 1, 2000.

If you have any questions, or would like me to speak with you further on 
this, please feel free to contact me at 713-646-8258.

Sincerely,

Matthew Tezyk
Project Manager

Matt:

I understand that you have been following the order of the CALME gas turbine 
with Siemens Westinghouse.

Please summarize for us the status of inspections, shipments of the order. 
What took place what remains (where and when). Are you the custodian of the 
various inspection, shipping / receipts etc.
What deviations if any from the Contract.

I would appreciate it if you can address specifically what is the situation 
with the Generator, we understand that while it was being unloaded in the 
Houston port, it encountered some damage.
Please indicate what is the damage, and what is the steps that is now in 
place to fix the problem. again who is doing what.

Are we still on target that the complete GTG will be in storage by September 
2000.

Regards,

Hemmat Safwat

It is OURS, all OURS.  So what's the whopping balance now?

FYI,  someone in our group must be living right,  the Anglers have
experienced a windfall.  Received a check today for $13,664.45 related to
the reimbursement of the maintenance tax surcharge for tax years 1991
through 1996 to insurance companies by the Texas Workers Comp Insurance
Fund.  A couple of weeks ago I received another check for 257.91 also TWC
fund related.  Both checks reference periods prior to the sale to KTI.  Let
me know if you think these should go to KTI but they appear to me to be
Anglers money.

As promised...

On further review, I don't think we need to challenge the proposed
reference to Parking and Loaning Transactions as being "interruptible".
Although Peoples' GTC does not characterize this service as interruptible,
there are provisions in the GTC re scheduling and priority that render the
service interruptible, e.g. Sect. 6.3.

We had a wonderful, quiet weekend. The wine was very good.  I drank it 
without food, as it was nice and light, which is how I like my reds.  It 
would have been good with a tomato based pasta, I think.

How do I find out how much vacation I have?  I know there's a system on the 
intranet.  I want to plan some time off this year, if possible.  I know how 
difficult it can get the longer I wait.

Thursday I won't be in until around noon. More Michael stuff.

We usually have seven ports, but tomorrow there are only six ports 
available.  I didn't think it would be a problem since several of you are in 
the same area and could go in one office.  In the future, we will have our 
seven ports.  Thanks, Suzanne (x37340)

GE form contract, 1 1/2 hours.

What is the meeting regarding and how much time do you need?

I'm going to be on this conference call (the David Tucker call) for a long 
time.  Would you mind getting me a Diet Coke?  I have the money in here, but 
I can't leave my desk.  I should have thought ahead. 

Thanks!!!!!!

Kay

Hello again,

Makes sense to me.  I would add "on behalf of MEH" after "Transaction" on the 
first line of the second paragraph of VII.

I don't have the MEH Operating Agreement.  Do you have an electronic copy of 
it?

Thanks,

Kay

   
	
	

Per my voice mail, will you please take a quick look at my edits to Vlady's 
draft risk management policy attached below.  I don't think any of them are 
problematic, but Vlady has some concerns mainly because the base Enron Corp. 
risk management policy was used as the template and therefore I am 
effectively making edits to it.

I will be leaving the office today around 11:00 so I want to turn this to 
Peoples before then if possible.  On any other business, I will be 
unavailable from 1:30 to probably 3:00 today, but can be reached via pager 
800-980-1771 or cell phone 312-925-8888 at any other time.

As always - thanks for your help.

Gregg
Some comments on your comments:

Section II: I don't like the title "Commercial Development Manager" but 
rather "Risk Manager" 
Response:         The title Commercial Development Manager comes from the MEH 
Operating Agreement.  We can amend the LLC Agreement  if necessary, but it 
seems burdensome since the title is only a formality.  However, as currently 
written, the Commercial Development Manager is the person responsible for 
managing the daily business, i.e. similar to a desk director.  In order to 
maintain control of this position, it can only be filled by an Enron nominee 
and will report directly to the MEH General Manager, Laura Luce of Enron.

Section VII: Majority of the wording came initially from attorneys, I would 
recommend confirming that.
Response:          I will run this by the attorneys.  However, from a 
technical perspective, Section VII refers to employees of MEH.  No one in the 
Chicago office is an employee of MEH, but rather we all remained employees of 
our respective organizations.  I will ask the attorneys if we need to limit 
Section VIII: Who is the General Manager of MEH?
Response:          As mentioned above, Laura Luce, Vice President of Enron 
North America
Let me know if any of my responses don't make sense or you still have any 
questions.  I am still going to try to get this out by 10:00 or so.

Vlady - As we discussed, I am attaching my revisions to your initial draft.  
They are mainly cosmetic attempts to make the RM Policy terms consistent with 
the MEH Operating Agreement and separate MEH from any behind the scenes 
reporting or controls that ENA chooses to place on Richard/MEH.  Let me know 
if you have any concerns about my edits.  I would like to send this to 
Peoples end of day today.  I will follow up with Structuring to find a body 
to model the underlying asset position.  

Thanks - Gregg

Is he availabe tomorrow?

Once you get a picture of availability (maybe you have it all ready), ask 
Sheila what she wants to do. She may want to re-schedule for tomorrow morning.

Kay

Scott Dieball isn't available today.  Is he key, or should we try for 
tomorrow?  I didn't know how urgent the meeting was.

Thanks.  And thanks for the drink.

Everyone else is available.  I just talked to Sheila and she said to invite 
Barto (which I just left him a vm).  She said the meeting could proceed and 
Dieball could be filled in.  I'll let you know what I hear from Barto.

That's it, just HAPPY BIRTHDAY.  Hope no one is picking on you too badly 
today. 

Kay

Hi Ben,

Hope Day 1 of your daughter's illustrious academic career went well.  

We are hoping to meet tomorrow at 130 Central in 38C2 to discuss GE issues.  
Sheila says you won't be here quite that soon, but it would be very helpful 
if you could join us once you get here.  Time permitting, we can discuss the 
ESA transaction once we are done with the GE stuff.

See you soon,

Kay

We have scheduled a meeting to address the status of our discussions with GE, 
and develop an organized approach to some issues.  The meeting will be held 
at 130 in EB 38C2.

See you then,

Kay

FYI. 
We are gathering together our commercial crew to brief them on the 
outstanding issues between us and hopefully will be getting back to you to 
reschedule our call this week.  In the meantime, we are awaiting Mike's 
mark-up.  Would you let him know?  I'm on the run.  Thanks!

FYI.
Please see attached clean and blackline copies of the revised agreement for 
your review, per my discussion with Kay yesterday.

 - CLN10.DOC
 - RED10.DOC

Not dead yet.  Ozzie and Heather are looking at some other possibilities. 
They don't want to lose momentum until it is clear that there aren't other 
viable alternatives.

Kay -

I heard yesterday that this deal was dead due to the flooded Westinghouse 
generator.  Not true?

Fred,

My understanding (which I will verify) is that Enron would still be at risk 
from an environmental standpoint with a lease.  We could try to lessen our 
exposure as much as possible with the lease, and get indemnity from PGL.

Attached is the cost sharing agreement proposed by PERC on the Torrence 
site.  It proposes that ENA agree to share all future development costs and 
environmental liabilities on the Torrence parcel on a 50/50 basis.  I believe 
that there are some inconsistencies between the language in this Agreement 
and the PDA signed in April of 2000 (i.e. dates, terms, and the members of 
the management committee).

I have informed PERC that it is ENA's policy not to step in the chain of 
title on properties with known environmental liabilities.  I have recommended 
to PERC that PGL (Peoples regulated utility) buy the Torrence property (they 
want if for remediation purposes anyway) from Air Liquide on June 26th and 
hold it while PERC and ENA complete the due diligence required to develop a 
commercially viable power plant development project. It will be my 
recommendation that ENA does not execute this cost sharing agreement as 
written.  If the environmental liability risk was removed and stronger 
language inserted on the control of going-forward development expenditures 
then it would represent a commercially reasonable agreement.  Ideally we 
would like this agreement to provide for ENA to market the Torrence and other 
development sites (ENA's sell-down strategy) under a known value sharing 
formula and transaction financial "triggers".  I will discuss this approach 
with Laura Luce and Curtis Cole this week.

From a legal perspective, could we structure a long-term lease between PGL 
and Torrence Power LLC (PERC & ENA as owners) that could provide commercial 
site control to PERC/ENA while leaving the environmental liabilities on the 
Torrence property with PGL?  (this would be fitting, because PGL has owned 
the property in the past and have likely been the major contributor to the 
site's environmental contamination).

Call me to discuss these issues.

Enron Pres: Still Committed to Power Generation Business

	?Mail this article to a friend 
	
	By James Covert 
	Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
	NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Despite an increasing emphasis on wholesale trading 
rather than asset ownership in its electricity operations, Enron Corp. (ENE, 
news, msgs) will continue to develop and purchase power plants, president 
Jeffrey Skilling told Dow Jones Newswires on Wednesday. 
	"Generation assets are essential to a successful trading operation," Skilling 
said, responding to recent trade reports that the company plans to exit the 
power generation business. The Houston-based energy company is "absolutely 
not" selling its power plants as part of its strategy, he said. 
	Enron will continue to build and purchase natural gas-fired "peaking plants," 
which produce power only during times of high demand and wholesale prices, 
Skilling said. 
	Enron has begun construction of a few such projects in the U.S. Midwest and 
South, and will continue development chiefly in the U.S and Europe, he said. 
	"The margins are higher (in wholesale power markets) in Europe," Skilling 
said. "The market there is more fractional, and that creates more 
opportunities for someone who's playing across the board." 
	Developments in Europe, particularly in southern Europe, also offer a higher 
per-unit rate of return, Skilling said. 
	Nonetheless, Skilling did confirm that the company isn't interested in 
building larger-sized plants in any country, and that its construction goals 
may not be as lofty as those of other energy companies. 
	"We are not interested in building base-load plants," Skilling said, 
referring to large power plants that produce power in steady quantities 
around the clock. 
	"Base load simply delivers megawatts - that's a bulky, undifferentiated 
commodity," Skilling said. "But peaking plants allow us to play on the shape 
of the market of that commodity." 
	Skilling declined to give any projections or figures related to Enron's 
future development plans, saying that they weren't set in stone. 
	But Skilling said the company generally aims to site power plants where there 
are bottlenecks in the transmission system, and that Enron isn't focused on 
any one geographic region as opposed to others. 
	"There are companies out there saying they're going to build 40,000 
megwawatts by such-and-such a date, and I don't really see how that's 
possible," Skilling said. "There are just too many variables to approach 
markets like that."

I'm ready for another trip to Chicago, to work on the details, the transfer 
pricing, the Manlove monetization, etc.  Would a day next week be good?  It 
would probably be helpful if Laura had some availability as well. Tuesday is 
bad for me, but Wednesday or Thursday looks good.

I'll look over the list and give you a call after lunch.

Here is the latest business setup list.  I went through the list with Dave 
Delainey yesterday in our offices.  He then presented the list to Tom 
Patrick, President of Peoples Energy, at dinner last night.  Dave has also 
asked me to forward my weekly updates to both him and Tom so they can see 
where progress is being made and what, if any, pressures need to be applied 
within their respective organizations.  Let's discuss this to figure out the 
best gameplan for crossing some of these off the list.  A good portion of the 
next steps are in Peoples' court, but I am sure there are some things we can 
drive the ship on.

Thanks,

Gregg

If anyone asks, I would prefer to have Gloria for our temp.

Thanks,

Kay

I have already requested October 23-26 off for vacation and would like to add 
the 27th to make it a week off.  Brenda, would you please get a temp for my 
desk for that entire week.  Thanks!

Please hang on to this for future reference.

Revised Draft 9/6/00.  Please call me if you would like me to clarify or 
expand upon any of our points.  There may be points that Lisa Bills can 
address more thoroughly than I can.  I will seek her input on any question or 
concern you may voice.

Article 1.1 Consistent use of quotation marks: Commercial Operation Date; 
Deliver; Delivered; Dispatch Order.

Article 1.1 "Facility Substation": Do rights to access this meter by Seller 
need to be stated, or does Article 8.3 give the Seller rights to the data 
generated by the meter?

Article 2.2/3 Commencement Date and Commercial Operation Date are different.

Article 2.3 (b) (i)  Seller commencing construction of the Facility on or 
before December 31, 2000 will render the off-balance sheet treatment of the 
turbines provided by Turbo Park void.

Article 3.4 (c) Third sentence: misspelling of schedule.

Article 3.4 (c) (i)  Close parenthesis needed after "... with Section 8.3."

Article 4.2 Monthly is capitalized, but is not defined in Articles 1.1 and 
8.1.

Article 5.1 (b) Reference should be to Buyer not Virginia Power. 

Article 12 Does this article allow to disclose the terms of the Agreement 
and/or relevant facts about the Facility to prospective purchases of either 
the Agreement or Facility?

General  Use of day versus Day versus Business Day.  See Articles 2.1, 2.3 
(b), 3.4 (d), 3.4 (g), 4.7, 7.1 (a), etc., for examples.

General   Use of convention to spell numbers immediately followed by the 
numerals.  See Articles 1.1, 2.1, 3.4 (e), 4.6, 14.2, etc., for examples.

Hi Gregg,

It looks good for tomorrow.  I prefer not to schedule anything later than 
300, if possible, just to give myself a chance to handle the end of the week 
details/crises.

Kay

Hi Bob,

Does this have anything to do with the Wisconsin site you mentioned in the 
staff meeting?

Attached is the draft term sheet for the WEPCO term sheet on the Plano site.  
I have used the 9/01 clean version of the ComEd Plano term sheet as the 
template for this document.

I have made some changes to reflect our discussions with WEPCO including the 
following:

 1. Term (3 and 5 year)
 2. Contract Base Capacity Charge ($ amount may be subject to further change)
 3. Scheduling (day-ahead only)
 4. Project Updates (term modification dates changed to reflect 3 or 5 year 
term)
 5. Commercial Operation Date Guarantee (dates change to reflect '02 start 
date/termination right triggered off of 6/1/01 notice by Seller)
 6. Delay/Early Completion Penalties/Bonus (changed to reflect different 
Capacity Charge)
 7. Availability LD's (changed to reflect different Capacity Charge)

Please review and send me your comments.  I am planning to send this document 
to WEPCO tomorrow afternoon. 

Thanks,
Fred

I saw something on the intranet which says you can check all your benefits, 
etc , including vacation time.  It called for a password.  Did you receive a 
password for yours?  I wonder if it is the same as the password when you 
submit benefits.  Any ideas?

Becky, could you run a time off report so Kay can see how much vacation time 
she has left.  I don't believe I can do that for her.  You can just send it 
to me, or whatever is easier.  Thanks, Suz

Lisa:  Attached is a draft of the Power Purchase Agreement with VEPCO, based 
on the current version of the term sheet.  In preparing the draft, we did 
encounter several additional questions for Enron's consideration.  These are 
noted with brackets and, in some cases, italicized notes, in the draft and 
are also highlighted below.  You may want to address these issues before this 
goes to VEPCO.

Cover and first page-- Should the party to the agreement (for the moment) be 
ENA or a special purpose company?

Definitions--  We included a defined term "Emergency Start-Up" (a start up or 
increase in energy scheduled during a day) and a place in Exhibit A to 
include a price for this, although this was not covered in the term sheet.

Section 2.2--  We included a provision for VEPCO to take test energy (energy 
charge only; no demand charge)--do you want this?

Section 2.3--  This was taken from the term sheet, but is it correct that COD 
will be July 1 (since the demand charge is supposed to start June 1?)  Also, 
it would be best to define "commencement of construction" to avoid 
controversy down the road.  We could either do this now or put in a 
placeholder that indicates it needs to be defined or be silent, whichever is 
your preference.  Also, bear in mind that we have not included a specific 
remedy (e.g., liquidated damages) if the Seller does not achieve that 
milestone on time.  Under the default provision (Section 8.1(c)), there would 
be a 30 day period to cure before Buyer could terminate (extendible to 90 
days if a longer period of time is needed and Seller diligently pursues the 
cure).  Would you prefer the right to pay ld's and extend the time period?

Section 3.1(b)--  Should the 1400 hour limitation apply to all sales under 
this PPA or only sales from the Facility?  I.e., would you use this Agreement 
to sell to VEPCO power in addition to what would be available from the 
Facility?  Also, is this a calendar year limitation--i.e., could they take 
1400 hours in the period June-Dec. 2001 or does the 1400 hours need to be 
pro-rated for the first year?

Section 3.4-- Since this is not a base load plant, the normal definition of 
Availability as the number of hours in a year of operations compared to the 
total hours in the year would not seem to be applicable.  Instead, we stated 
that the Facility would be capable of being available 92% of the year (other 
than due to Force Majeure and 336 hours (2 weeks) of scheduled 
maintenance)--i.e., that if they tried to schedule it, it is expected to be 
available.  Is that what Enron intended?  Additionally, the term sheet stated 
that a remedy for failure to meet Availability would need to be agreed--why 
wouldn't cost of cover damages be appropriate? Also, please note that we 
included language stating that Seller will not perform maintenance during 
peak periods.

Section 3.5(b)-- Please note the bracketed language re taking Blocks of 
Energy.  We have 50 MW minimum blocks but the capacity is 223--should we 
allow the last Block to be 23 if they've scheduled all the rest?

Section 3.5(c)-- Please see the bracketed language at the end of this Section.

Section 4.7-- Should there a required minimum take of Energy?

Article 6-- The Genco/Santee Cooper form of PPA we used as a model did not 
have any provisions on metering.  (See placeholder note in Article 6.)  Do 
you want to add such a provision, ignore it or just include a placeholder for 
now?

Section 9.1-- Is 30 days from invoice correct for the payment due date or 
would you prefer a shorter period?

Article 15-- The Genco/Santee Cooper form had mediation as a required step 
prior to arbitration.  Should we keep that?  Also, the form of arbitration is 
"baseball" arbitration--i.e.,  the arbitrators have to chose one party's 
position or the other's.  Is that what you want?

Section 16.2--  We used New York for governing law, on the premise that it 
will be difficult to get VEPCO to agree to Texas law and we would not 
recommend Virginia law for this contract.

Exhibit A-- There are a number of questions on the pricing exhibit--please 
see the bracketed notes therein.

Please call and let us know how you would like to proceed on this draft.

After hearing back from everyone, a meeting is scheduled for 3:00 today to 
discuss the cash management needs of enovate (formerly known as MEH).  Sam 
has reserved conference room 2718 for all of you in Houston.  Once you are 
all together, just call me.  Thanks for everyone's flexibility on short 
notice.

Gregg

Ok.

Please call Barbara Dillard at 312-541-1232.  She called yesterday about some 
amendments to the Peoples Gas deal that I worked on.  It may be best for Jeff 
Hodge to handle it but would you find out what's involved and the logistics?

Ben,

Here's a draft of an MOU for the sale of the LMs and ABB equipment to ESA.  
One issue is when this transaction can close.  Since the equipment is owned 
by WestLB and since the feeling is we don't want to involve WestLB in the 
transaction, the actual transfer would take place at the termination of the 
WestLB facility.  If another approach is preferred, we will need to circle 
back with Lisa.

A second issue I see is with the concept that GE will need to look to both 
ENA (or WestLB's successor) for some of the payments, but look to ESA for 
payment for changes, storage, etc.  As far as I know, this concept hasn't 
been addressed with GE.

I re-calculated the overhead charge, so you might want to check it out.

I look forward to your comments.
 
Kay

I'm reading it now. 

Greg called.  He mentioned that the agency agreement is ready to go to 
Peoples after we've incorporated any comments you may have on the draft I 
circulated yesterday.  

I look forward to hearing from you at your convenience.

Thanks!  

DT

David,

Please change the date on the draft so that we won't confuse it with the 
prior drafts.

I would delete "specifically" from 2.10 (c), and add "or later ratify such 
transaction" (or something to that effect), just in case they later learn and 
accept the transaction.  

In 2.10 (x), add to "due to an inability to pay, or other credit reason".  In 
(y), add "or a contractual defense to payment" [could be force majeure, etc]

Again in 2.10, third sentence from the end "any interest, penalties, 
attorneys fees and court costspayable by the Hub Shipper...;

3.3  Delete "prior" before "approval", and add "or ratification" in the 
redlined section on refunds.

Thanks,

Kay

Here's what's hot, what's not:

Virginia Power - don't know how hot it is.  We should know more on Monday. 

Chicago - just finished commenting on the Hub Agency agreement.  I would like 
to visit there next week. As you know, the Manlove monetization is still on 
the list.  Laura sent me her comments to the LOI yesterday - relatively mild, 
so the LOI should be going to Peoples in the near future.  You have the list 
that Gregg prepared on commercial/legal to do's, and he and I will work on 
those things next week.

LM stuff.  General consulting business; form 97-10 EPC for affiliate, form GE 
contract (drafted by AK) on the list.

ESA/ENA turbine sale.  Sent Ben a draft MOU.  Not a time hog.

Miscellaneous development stuff - land options, etc, for Fred and Rusty.  Not 
very time consuming.

Opps, I'm late for a meeting!  I can give you whatever details you need.  All 
things considered, I'm in pretty good shape.

Kay

Hi Kathleen,

I will try to take this one it.  There is a charge for it (I think) that the 
department picks up.   

By the way, have you been invited to the ENA law conference at the 
Woodlands?  We need to get you in on that one.  

Talk to you soon.

Kay, I will be in Houston on Monday through Wednesday afternoon, but will be
busy most of Tuesday.  Lee had hoped that we could get together, or at least
talk, about this and the facility agreement and payment for Change Order #2.
How is your late Monday afternoon looking?

Hi Richard,

I'm working on a form EPC contract.  Do you have a favorite arbitration 
clause you would suggest be included?

Thanks,

Just in case I forget to mention it, I need to move our SF visit to Friday 
am, due to travel plans.  Is this still ok with you?

Kay

I'm not particularly wild about many of the changes proposed by GE.  Seems 
that it would be a good idea to get a consensus on how to respond.  Here are 
the issues I see:

Indemnity issues:
They should indemnify us from claims by their employees/subcontractors.
Indemnity should be triggered by strict liability as well as negligence.
What is a cognizant government?  

Limit of liability issues:
They want to limit their indemnity obligation to 100% of purchase price.  
They want the limit of liability to apply to gross negligence, if possible.
They don't want to clarify that they have to indemnify us for another party's 
claim for consequentials (as in a personal injury claim).

We've don't have anything concrete on assignment yet.

Comments?

Sheila has asked that we change Wednesday's call to 1100 Central, or 100 
Central if 1100 doesn't work.  Is this a problem?

Kay

They should have to

Folks,

Having conferred at last with my colleagues, I can now forward to you our
draft language for the Indemnity and LOL clauses.  As Steve mentioned in his
earlier message, he has suggested some issues to discuss which could bring
us closer to resolution on that issue.  Please let me know if you have any
question!

	?Mail this article to a friend 
	
	(This article was originally published Monday) 
	WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has limited 
authority to address flawed electricity markets in California and alleged 
price gouging by power producers, but will act to overhaul the state's 
wholesale power markets if necessary, FERC Chairman James Hoecker told a 
congressional panel Monday. 
	The commission was ready to act once the results of an expedited staff 
investigation of problems affecting power markets in the U.S. West becomes 
available, Hoecker said in testimony presented to a San Diego field hearing 
of the House Commerce Committee's energy panel. 
	"If we need to fix market rules or market structures within our jurisdiction, 
we will do so," Hoecker told lawmakers. And if price gouging is occurring "as 
some have alleged," he added, "we will respond accordingly, by revoking 
market-based rates or otherwise." 
	However, Hoecker stressed that the commission's authority is limited under 
the Federal Power Act. 
	"The commission has limited ability to relieve the immediate customer crisis. 
Important aspects of this problem are a state responsibility, such as 
authorizing construction of new generation and transmission facilities," 
Hoecker testified. 
	The commission can't act to limit prices charged by power providers "until we 
have a record supporting such action," he said, referring to the results of 
the pending staff investigation. 
	Further, he said, the law bars FERC from ordering retroactive refunds to San 
Diego Gas & Electric Co. for the power it purchased this summer to serve its 
retail customer base. 
	Hoecker testified before the House Commerce Committee's Energy and Power 
Subcommittee, which is looking into the supply shortages in California this 
summer that have forced San Diego electricity consumers to pay twice as much 
for power as they did a year ago. 
	State Mkt Structure Blamed For Crisis 
	The hearing comes after much wrangling at FERC, as SDG&E, a unit of Sempra 
Energy (SRE, news, msgs), sought an order setting price caps for power bid 
into the state-sponsored electricity exchange, and power producers sought an 
order allowing cost recovery for lost opportunity sales if the state's 
independent grid operator curtailed sales outside California, where price 
controls don't apply. 
	FERC hasn't yet responded to the producers, and deferred action on SDG&E's 
bid for price controls until the staff investigation is completed. But it 
left in place an order allowing the independent system operator to limit the 
price it pays for power, which acts as a de facto cap on prices bid into the 
power exchange. 
	Hoecker, while withholding judgment pending the staff probe, appeared to 
place much of the blame for this summer's crisis with the state-mandated 
market structure, which left San Diego consumers subject to spot-market 
volatility. 
	And he appeared to suggest that FERC's order directing utilities to transfer 
transmission assets to control of large regional transmission organizations, 
or RTOs, will offer an opportunity to develop a regional solution to the 
power-supply problem. 
	FERC deferred to California in restructuring the wholesale market in 
California because its experience with new market institutions such as power 
exchanges and ISOs was limited, Hoecker said. 
	Other states, such as Pennsylvania, were "less prescriptive than California 
in telling the commission how their wholesale markets should operate," 
Hoecker noted. 
	Now, with FERC's Order 2000 encouraging formation of RTOs, "the commission is 
in a very different posture with respect to the structure of wholesale 
markets," he said. 
	"Large regional markets can be made to work effectively," Hoecker told the 
lawmakers, citing the Pennsylvania restructuring as an example. 
	Other witnesses were more forceful in criticizing the state-mandated market 
structure. 
	By requiring the state's three investor-owned utilities to purchase all their 
electricity from the power exchange and limiting their ability to hedge price 
risks by entering into long-term fixed-price contracts, the state left 
consumers subject to volatility in the state-mandated spot market, said 
officials with Enron Corp. (ENE, news, msgs) and Reliant Energy (REI, news, 
msgs). 
	California's market structure "placed no economic incentives on the default 
utility providers to look out for the costs that are ultimately passed on to 
their consumers," Reliant's John Stout testified. 
	"San Diego's experience offers the Congress an unparalleled opportunity to 
learn from a bungled attempt at deregulation," said Michael Shames, executive 
director of Utility Consumer's Action Network. 
	Shames and other witnesses warned the congressional committee that 
California's electricity crisis is likely to occur in other regions of the 
country unless steps are taken to free up interstate trade in power and allow 
FERC to better police markets. 
	"California is just the latest problem area in U.S. power markets and, unless 
policymakers act quickly, it will not be the last," said Enron Corp. (ENE, 
news, msgs) Steven Kean executive vice president. 
	"Unless Congress and FERC are willing to address the interstate issues that 
are beyond the jurisdiction of state legislators and regulators, I predict 
that our experience in San Diego is indicative of what others will encounter 
in trying to create a competitive electricity market," said Edwin Guiles, 
Sempra's president of regulated operations. 
	"This electricity crisis is not a California-only problem," said Rep. Brian 
Bilbray, R-Calif., who represents San Diego and requested Monday's hearing. 
	"We will continue to be in this mess if state and federal officials don't 
work together to find long-term solutions to the flaws in the marketplace," 
Bilbray said.

Can the gas company also make the same requests?  

The NC Attorney General asserts a statutory right to intervene which I think
misreads the statute but which the Commission has always allowed.  The AG
routinely intervenes.  I suspect that in this case they are interested in
the possibility of bypass and the merchant plant issue.  I will call Len
Green today to find out.  The AG can make the same discovery requests that
the Public Staff makes, subject, as was the case with the Public Staff, to
the execution of a confidentiality agreement.

Hi there.

I changed our SF appointment to 900 on Friday.

We have not been successful in getting a hotel room anywhere close to where 
we are going.  There is some big fashion convention in NY, and the rooms are 
booked as far away as Danbury, Connecticut.  Wild, isn't it?  Heather says 
there is a chance that we will fly out tomorrow, spend tomorrow night in NY, 
then I can fly to Chicago Thursday am.  I still plan on flying back on 
Thursday pm so that I can make that 900 appointment.  That may mean taking 
the midnight flight, but what the heck.

I'll keep you posted. 

Kay

I won't be in Friday am, as I have a 900 appointment out of the office 
(another school visit - I hope we are almost done).

I don't know my travel plans yet.  I may ( or may not) be leaving today.  If 
not, I will be leaving tomorrow.  I don't need you to make any arrangements 
yet.

Kay

Please note.

I thought you might ask me that!  NCNG could make the request, but we would
have a good argument that it doesnt have the same need to know as the Public
Staff and Attorney General (which both represent "the Public") and that the
potential for misuse of proprietary information is much greater and harder
to circumscribe.  I tend to think NCNG would not ask.  Based on the limited
statement of interest in their petition to intervene, it's hard for me to
see what they could justify asking for.  Also, they always have to be
careful, because more often than not, they are going to be on the receiving
end of data requests.  They can't argue that they're entitled to obtain
certain information if they ever want to argue that they don't have to
disclose the same thing.

I guess you are having some kinda fun over there, hitting the forward 
button.  Actually, I appreciate the info.

Brian D Barto@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
06/02/2000 01:28 PM
Jeff and Reynaldo Garcia spoke on this subject at length, and Rey convinced 
Jeff that spitting was necessary.  AT that time the Enron Contracting entity 
was not specified to be Energia...    If you want to unsplit the documents it 
will add additional time in excess geting a consolidation agreement completed 
I think.  Please include Rey in your quest for closure.  PS  GE is now OK 
with the split.

I need help getting closure on the Consolidation Agreement.  I hope that we 
do not invent other issues as well.

Gentlemen,

I have made changes to the consolidation agreement, which I hope all will 
find acceptable:

(It does need a date or two.)

As for the termination agreement, here's what I suggest:

Do we want to address the purchaser's parent guaranty in both of the 
contracts, or just the consolidation agreement?  I would suggest that we make 
the guaranty a deliverable 30 days after execution of the contracts, which 
gives us time to get the Mitsui assignment done, as we expect to assign the 
contracts immediately.  That way, Mitsui can provide the guaranty, if 
necessary.  If ENA does provide the guaranty, we would want to have the 
ability to have it replaced with a suitable substitute guaranty from Mitsui.  

Sorry I missed your call.  It was a day of meetings.  I will be on the road 
tomorrow, but will check my voice mail.

Kay

It currently appears that I will be on the road Wednesday and Thursday.  
Figures!

I am going to send you a copy of the marked up interconnection agreement, 
which has comments from various Enron people. I thought it might help you 
think about which way to head.  

I would appreciate receiving an electronic file of the IC you prepared.   

Talk to you soon,

Kay

Is there a time limit for lodging an objection?

the first step would be to object to the party making the request.  If the
parties cannot work it out as between themselves, the one with the objection
can appeal to the Commission.  I don't believe it would weaken our position
to have released the information to the Public Staff for some of the same
reasons I suggested earlier--particularly the facts that the Public Staff
and the AG have a statutory obligation to represent the public,and are not a
profit-making entity, and neither    would be able to misuse proprietary
information, as NCNG would.

Allyson,

What is the proceedure for objecting to a request (either the intervenor's
or the Public Staff's)?  Is our position weakened in resisting an
intervenor's request if we have given the same information to the Public
Staff?

He suggested e-mailing him dates when Enron was available to go to Richmond 
to discuss the interconnect.  I don't know if you want to go or if you plan 
on sending one of the developers, but will you schedule this meeting (since I 
won't be negotiating this part of it).

Thanks.  Let me know if you have any problems.

Could you resend it, please?

Thanks,

Kay

Gentlemen,

Here's the notice we discussed.

Folks,

Having conferred at last with my colleagues, I can now forward to you our
draft language for the Indemnity and LOL clauses.  As Steve mentioned in his
earlier message, he has suggested some issues to discuss which could bring
us closer to resolution on that issue.  Please let me know if you have any
question!

Best regards,

 Mike

Ben,

We have a draft of the VEPCO "standard" interconnect, which has been 
internally reviewed by Mitch Robinson and Christi Nicolay.  Would you like a 
copy? Nancy Wodka (Bracewell & Patterson, DC office) is outside counsel 
working on it as well.  We have had no substantive discussions with VEPCO 
about this agreement at all.

Let me know how you want to proceed.

Thanks,

Kay

Ben,

I spoke with the VA Power contact today who is responsible for the 
interconnection agreement.  His name is Wayne Duman (804.257.4096, 
Wayne_Duman@dom.com).  

He suggested e-mailing him dates when Enron was available to go to Richmond 
to discuss the interconnect.  I don't know if you want to go or if you plan 
on sending one of the developers, but will you schedule this meeting (since I 
won't be negotiating this part of it).

Thanks.  Let me know if you have any problems.

Heather

Important question...

Where should I stay in Chicago?

Thanks,

Kay

flying to NYC at 330 on CO.  Don't know flight number.  Don't know where I'm 
staying in NYC.

WED: Fly from Newark to Chicago tomorrow at 645 pm.  Don't know where I'm 
staying in Chicago.

THURS: Fly from Chicago to Houston, leaving at 200pm, arriving at 428.  

That's all I know for now.

Kay

Hey Ken,

I'm so sorry.  I'm not trying to hide!  I just found out I have a 300 flight 
to NYC on a deal I know little about, then on to Chicago, no hotel rooms in 
either city but GOTTA GO, not sure of the return. In short, I've been 
Enronized. I picked up your number on a scrap of paper instead of the travel 
agent's number (different scrap of paper I still have not found), and when 
you answered I couldn't figure out who I called. At least your email helped 
me get back to reality.

I apologize for the confusion, for not getting back to you, etc.  Please 
don't read anything into it other than your glimpse into Enron. My sense is 
I'd better not commit to anything this week, since I literally don't know 
whether I am coming or going.

Thanks,

Kay

You can run but you're not very good at hiding!

Kay,

The below looks like a good summary of what we discussed on 8/30.  The=20
pipeline is actually spelled Mahomet, but otherwise this is the right track=
.=20

Let's set up a conference call (with Gregg) at your earliest convenience.  =
I=20
need to ensure that a document is turned to Peoples as soon as possible and=
 I=20
had hoped we would be further along at this point.  I know we are all tryin=
g=20
to juggle schedules, however;  I need to determine if we have a resource=20
issue that requires additional assistance in support of our Chicago busines=
s.

Thanx,
Laura

  =20
=09
=09
I'm working on the agreement, but since it is taking longer than I had hope=
d,=20
I wanted to send you my understanding of the basic premise for your input. =
=20
I'll continue to refine/integrate this into a real document while you revie=
w=20
the important stuff:

Hub Services.=20

=01&Hub Services=018 include (a) transactions entered into by MEH or the PG=
L HUB=20
which are subject to Peoples' Hub FERC operating statement, and (b) all=20
physical transactions which require the use of the Manlove or Mohammad fiel=
ds=20
(also known as =01&exchange=018 or =01&enhanced hub=018 services).=20

The profit [what is profit? Obviously before tax, but otherwise a GAAP=20
standard?] from Hub Services shall be split as follows:

? For transactions entered into between February 15, 2000 through September=
=20
30, 2000, the profit shall be equally shared.

? For transactions entered into from October 1, 2000 to September 30, 2001=
=20
(and successive years until September 30, 2004), Peoples will receive the=
=20
first $4 million in profit (cumulative, not annual), and will Enron receive=
=20
the next $1million in profit.  For any profit exceeding $5 million, Peoples=
=20
and Enron will share any on a 50/50 basis.

This arrangement excludes all agency fees paid to MEH.  These fees will be=
=20
shared 50/50 from the inception.=20

All internal costs incurred in the normal course of business will be borne =
by=20
the party incurring same. All third party costs will be shared equally, and=
=20
require MEH board approval.

PERC Peaking Agreement

PERC has contracts with PGL and with NICOR contracts relating to the=20
ethane/propane peaking facility. The two existing contracts pay a total of=
=20
$2million (approximate or exact) in demand charges annually. Any profit=20
exceeding $2 million in a year will be shared by Peoples and Enron on a 50/=
50=20
basis.

If either of these contracts is extended in any form other than the current=
=20
form, then Peoples and Enron share the demand charge and the profit on a=20
50/50 basis.

Other Transactions=20

Peoples and Enron will split the profit from any transactions other than=20
those described above on a 50/50 basis.=20

Kay

Just to complete the picture.

09/08/2000 03:14 PM
Kay,
As things continue to move ahead on the other doc's (with Greg), I would like 
to priority to go to getting the first draft of the transfer price agreement 
as soon as possible.  Per your note below, I think Monday could be feasible 
with the expectation to get a draft to Peoples before the end of next week.  
In addition, the below agreement will no doubt be edited in the next week.

Thanx,

Laura

   
	
	

Laura,

Here's the revised version:

Here's a compared version so you will know what I did:

I'll work on the transfer price agreement today or this weekend so we will 
have something to discuss.  

I'm planning on being in Chicago on Thursday if you would like to discuss any 
of these matters.

Kay

fyi.  No hotel in NYC yet...

Ben/Mike,

Did you guys work out anything on the 12th slot?

Thanks,

Kay

Hi Julie,

Do I have seat assignments on the last two legs?

Many thanks,

Kay

Laura,

Here is a draft transfer price agreement:

I'm sure we may want to add some details, etc, but at least this gives us a 
beginning point.

I'm hoping that you received the revised draft of the Manlove LOI on 
September 8 which incorporated your initial comments to the first draft. We 
can discuss what you see as the most efficient path forward, and any 
additions, etc, you think are necessary.

I look forward to seeing you on Thursday, and breathing some cooler air for a 
change.

My cell phone is 713 304 8716, should you need to reach me in the meanwhile. 
I will also be checking my voicemail, but will not be picking up email.

Kay  

I'm walking into the lion's den on Thursday (a/k/a Chicago) to discuss 
various matters.  I know Laura is anxious to move forward on the Manlove 
deal.  I thought it might be really neat if we (Legal) could have a game plan 
for this deal, described by Laura as being "like the Bammel deal".  If I can 
get Laura to commit to a time, how about a conference call to discuss where 
to go with this?

I'm taking the long way to Chicago (via Connecticut), but will be checking 
voice mail, etc.  

Thanks,

Kay

Hello from Chicago.  I'm in Enron's offices, so I can pick up email.

Once I figure out what is going on with the ENA Legal reorganization, I 
should be able to figure out who to ask about hiring needs.  Then we should 
talk about how to get John into the program.

Maybe EECC has too many lawyers now.  How ironic, considering how busy we 
were this time last year. Things change!

Talk to you soon,

Kay

Hey there.

I don't think I've been fishing since July.  Geez, it is half way through 
September.

I'm in Chicago today (NYC yesterday).  A whirl wind tour.

I hear the Aquarium closed - killed by bike lanes.  Two weeks later the owner 
died.  We need to find a "new" dive.

Kay

John Schwartzenburg@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
09/12/2000 04:34 PM
Yeh-huh. I sent an e-mail. I will dredge up and resend. Been fishing lately?

I'm either losing my mind or my email.  Did you send me an email re GE?  I 
thought I saw one, but now I can't find it. Is that a trick, and if so, how 
do I do it?  

Could you resend it, please?

Thanks,

Kay

I gave Ben a very preliminary draft recently, then I left town (I'm in 
Chicago today, NYC yesterday).  I want to make sure I've addressed his 
concerns before drafts start floating around.  He and I are trying to get 
coordinated so that we can widen the circle a bit.

Hope this answers your questions.

Kay

Lisa.Alfaro@enron.com on 09/14/2000 08:13:40 AM
Has there been any draft of MOU or other document relating to this matter?
I was out of the office for a little while and I haven't heard anything so
I just wanted to check with you.

Sheila,

Just want you to know that I am thinking of you as I amuse myself, waiting 
for my meeting to begin.

Kay

Sounds good to me.  Next week, that is, not St. Louis.

Kay

   
	
	

Sent by: Ben Jacoby@ECT
My revisions. Let's discuss at your earliest convenience.

Ben

   
	
	

Ben,

Here's a draft of an MOU for the sale of the LMs and ABB equipment to ESA.  
One issue is when this transaction can close.  Since the equipment is owned 
by WestLB and since the feeling is we don't want to involve WestLB in the 
transaction, the actual transfer would take place at the termination of the 
WestLB facility.  If another approach is preferred, we will need to circle 
back with Lisa.

A second issue I see is with the concept that GE will need to look to both 
ENA (or WestLB's successor) for some of the payments, but look to ESA for 
payment for changes, storage, etc.  As far as I know, this concept hasn't 
been addressed with GE.

I re-calculated the overhead charge, so you might want to check it out.

I look forward to your comments.
 
Kay

Could you please email me the names of the officers of Enrow MW, LLC?

Thanks,

Kay

I thought I recalled you suggesting that changes we used on the LM 6000 deal 
be incorporated into a "master".  Maybe I misunderstood (not the first 
time!!!)

Scott Dieball@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
06/15/2000 04:33 PM
I don't know for sure but Kathy may be the better person to respond.

I haven't seen it.

Is there a master contract that Kathy (or someone) has been collecting 
comments?

Kay

Scott Dieball@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
06/15/2000 09:57 AM
I was under the impression that GE was to put together a written list of 
their specific concerns that we could review prior to any meeting.  Status?

Have you had any further discussions with John Schroeder about dates and 
agendas?  If not should we call him together?  I have most recently been 
blindsided by BlueDog and I think we need to get this show on the road.

You are my hero....

Revised draft.  Da Bulls toner is low, so the draft doesn't look good, and I 
don't know where the others print.  Guess I could just listen for it...

Let me clarify.  She sold the place when the city put in bike lanes because 
it screwed up the parking.

I've heard wonderful, divey things about the Roll-in.   A top prospect.

John Schwartzenburg@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT

The real deal:

Deb,

Could you please check with the state of incorporation (I believe Delaware) 
and the Corp Secretary's office to see if the papers have been processed in 
both places?

Thanks,

I received the name change document and it has been executed on behalf of 
Peoples and Enron.  I have also received and returned some state (IL) 
registration documents from you and Lillian Bailey.  

My understanding is that we have done everything we need to do to effect the 
entity name change to enovate, L.L.C.  Kay Mann is trying to follow up and 
confirm that all of the proper paperwork is in place.

Please let me know if there is anything further I can do to facilitate the 
process.

Hi guys,

Just wanted to check to see if there is a "go by" affiliate EPC contract, 
destined to be 97 10 compliant?  I'm ready to start working on it from ENA's

1.  Can I get a copy of the FuelCell Energy purchase order form.  Jeff said 
that you would have a copy.
2.  I forwarded to you a memo from Bingham that discusses the permitting 
requirements for the proposed projects.  FYI--I plan to call Bingham today 
with some follow up questions.
3. I forwarded to you a memo by ENSR on the air permit requirements for fuel 
cells.
4.  Please let me know when you can meet today to discuss the MOU.

CPCN
Allyson filed the ammended application 9/13/00.
Intervener and staff testimony is due 9/15/00.  This changed to 9/22 based on 
Allyson's email.
Enron rebuttal testimony is due 9/22/00.  This will be moved back as well.
Commission hearing is on 10/2/00.  This should stay firm based on Allyson's 
email.

Note:  If the AG's office and NCNG, the intervenersm, elect not to file 
testimony on 9/15/00, they can still come to the hearing and cross-examine.

Commission may issue CPCN conditional upon execution of the PPA; however, 
this is not certain.
Staff is worried about Merchant Plants--the VEPCO PPA has the shortest time 
period they have seen.
Allyson will call the AG's office 9/14/00 to discuss the AG's intervention.
The Commission's hearing will be October 2, 2000.
We will ask for an expedited briefing schedule (i.e. 2 weeks)
Optimistically, CPCN may be issued by the end of October.
We can only do site preparation work without the CPCN.  NO CONSTRUCTION.

Action Items:
Get a copy of the AG's intervention papers.
What is the status of NCNG's intervention?
Get Allyson to define the schedule going forward including potential hurdles.

Electrical Interconnect

Reagan and Terri spoke with Tim Talmadge (VEPCO) 9/13/00.  It appears that 
VEPCO is not far along in the study process.  We will follow-up with Wayne 
Duman of VEPCO and set a meeting as necessary.  Before we talk with VEPCO 
again, however, we need to understand the interconnect process with respect 
to the Edgecombe project.  Are we subject to the VEPCO tariff interconnect 
procedures, does PPA specify, or is this VEPCO's problem not ours? 

Action items:
Meet with Heather to discuss interconnect as it stands to date (i.e. with 
respect to VEPCO RFP and PPA negotiations).
Review VEPCO tariff.
Review PPA for reference.
Review draft interconnect agreement and submit/negotiate with VEPCO.
Followup with Wayne Duman to further discuss VEPCO interconnect issues and 
set meeting, as necessary.
We need to find out who VEPCO's attorney is who is working on the 
Interconnect and Operating Agreement.

Gas

The gas deal is a function of annexation of the property by Rocky Mount 
insofar as Rocky Mount will be the gas supplier.

Action Items:
Where does Rocky Mount (LDC) stand with repsect to getting their allocations 
from NCNG increased?
Is our site behind the Rocky Mount gate?
Do we need to work on an interconnect agreement with NCNG concurrently (as an 
insurance policy)?
Develop a construction schedule.
Check with Bill Sherk to see what his progress has been regarding NCNG 
negotiations.
Meet with Heathe and Ozzie to discuss/strategize.

Annexation/Zoning/Conditional Use Permit

Bill Sherk referred us to Bill Hoyle, attorney for the city's planning 
commission.  Hoyle referred us to Deck McCain, senior planner for the city.  
Discussions with McCain (9/13/00) reveal some timing issues with respect to 
annexation.  If we begin construction prior to annexation, we must go through 
the county's process--Stuart Bass is the county planning director.  Once 
annexation happens, we go through the city's process.  

The city process would include re-zoning as I2CU (CU = conditional use).  
This would take care of zoning and the conditional use permit at the same 
time.  This does involve filing notice AND holding a public meeting AND is 
expected to take approximately 60 days.  McCain was to prepare a package of 
information including the annexation petition, general statutes, and a letter 
describing the city's process and Enron deliverables.

In a follow-up conversation with McCain (9/14/00), he indicated that the 
city's expectation is that Enron would begin construction before annexation.  
We would, therefore, be subject to the county's zoning and conditional use 
permit processes.  He put his submittal preparation on hold as a result.

Action Items:
Talk with Kay Mann regarding expansion of Kilpatrick's scope to define these 
processes (zoning, annexation, and conditional use permitting) for us.
We need to build the "road maps" for annexation, zoning, and conditional use 
permitting processes.
Understand how zoning and conditional use permitting-- at the city and county 
levels--effect construction.
Begin Conditional Use Permitting process with county and city, concurrently.
Discuss our timing for option transfer.

Taxation

Rocky Mount made a verbal tax proposal totaling approximately $750,000 over 4 
years.  We have not evaluated or discussed with them further.  Financial 
model uses Enron tax assumptions.

Action Items:
Calculate present value of the Rocky Mount proposal.
Get with Kay Mann to see if Kilpatrick can get a copy of the deal Dynegy 
negotiated for their project.
What is the legal framework through which Rocky Mount has to offer such a tax 
deal?
What else does the legal framework offer, and can we negotiate a position we 
like?
Determine what depreciation schedule the city will use.
Determine what we think the taxes ought to be and PV it as a point of 
comparison.

Land 

Mayor of Rocky Mount was contacted by Bill Sherk last week about getting the 
ball rolling on acquiring more land.  Bill Sherk is going to begin the 
discussions with Ms. Ryerson and wants to make sure how much additional land 
we are asking for.

Action Items:
Review site map with respect to additional land desires.
Followup with Bill Sherk.
Talk with Kay regarding option conveyance document and lease agreement.

Air

Air permit is in-house.  To finalize the permit, we need to get a letter from 
the city, the county or both.

Action Items:
Get Janet's signature on the permit application.
Get check cut for application fee.
Get necessary letter from City of Rocky Mount and/or Edgecombe County (ENSR 
is engaged on this).
Send it all in.

Regulatory

During thsi politically driven CPCN process and considering the critical 
juncture, we should enlist external support, as we can.

Action Items:
Get with Tom Chapman to find out the "do's and don'ts" with regard to 
mustering political support.
Senator support letter, as appropriate.
Supportive inquiry phone calls, etc.

Christi,

I'm so glad you wrote, not just because the information is so important, but 
also because I've been meaning to return your call. 

I look forward to working with you on this and other issues. I'm sure I'll be 
calling with questions soon.

Kay

Hi Sheila,

When you have a moment (ha ha) could I get a copy of a couple of power 
project risk memos?

Thanks,

Kay

Here at Enron the lawyers generate risk memos in connection with 
transactions, summarizing the more important legal risks in a deal.  I've 
been taking notes along the way, but I will be asking you for your thoughts 
here shortly.  A discussion will be all I'm looking for at this time.

Thanks,

Kay

Today is not a good day for me to go out after work.  I'm planning on picking 
up my sweetie (Michael) from school, since I've been out of town.  I would 
vote for the Roll-in.  No question.  I would buy just to see Keffer there.

Kay

Can you tell if the documents have been filed in the state of incorporation?

Could you send me an email with a description of what you learned about how 
this done?  I know the procedures weren't followed.

Thanks,

Kay

I received the name change document and it has been executed on behalf of 
Peoples and Enron.  I have also received and returned some state (IL) 
registration documents from you and Lillian Bailey.  

My understanding is that we have done everything we need to do to effect the 
entity name change to enovate, L.L.C.  Kay Mann is trying to follow up and 
confirm that all of the proper paperwork is in place.

Please let me know if there is anything further I can do to facilitate the 
process.

thanks,

Here's another draft:

Note in particular changes in exclusivity (now bilateral), tax abatement 
(exh. A), termination rights, term.  I also made a minor change to dispute 
resolution.  As for their hesitancy to give us trade secrets, these should be 
covered by the confidentiality provisions, although this version is very 
basic (see underlined language).  I just want to make sure we get the gas 
supply contract ASAP. We can do a full blown confidentiality agreement that 
helps.  

I never heard back from Dutch Bumgardner.  I'll get the interconnection 
agreement started on this end, unless you think otherwise.

Hope you are having a good trip.

Kay

Is John there?

What do you want to do this weekend?  Should I thaw sausage for tonight?

Sweetie,
Since you went in late today, would it help you if I picked up Michael? It
would not be a problem for me.

06/15/2000 05:41 PM
Several thoughts from federal reg./transmission side:
I haven't worked with a VEPCO interconnection agreement yet, but many times 
there are requirements that the generator is required to provide emergency 
power to the interconnected transmission provider, in which case you would 
want the interconnection agreement to cover all costs you would incur to 
replace the energy at a different location (usually it is difficult to get 
this agreement, so you should check and then factor that into the equation).  
I would be happy to look at the interconnection agreement with you.
Interconnection of generation is a separate process from requesting 
transmission.  It appears that VEPCO has to buy the transmission (or use its 
network transmission) when the Delivery Point is the plant.  Enron will have 
to purchase transmission on VEPCO if it is selling to third parties off the 
plant and will have to purchase transmission on other systems if it wants to 
supply at an alternate delivery point.  Please discuss this with Kevin 
Presto's tranmission people (Bill Rust on 31).  Enron cannot use VEPCO's 
network transmission to delivery to third parties.
Is this plant in the VEPCO queue yet?  Also, FERC has issued some recent 
rulings that deal with time limits on system impact studies, etc.  While 
VEPCO is probably incentivized to get this built, you want to make sure that 
you do not lose optionality in selling to third parties from the plant due to 
transmission constraints.  A request for transmission on OASIS is the only 
way to ensure deliverability to third parties.
3.5 (c) Intra-day scheduling--You may have hourly transmission risk for an 
increase.  Unless you buy longer term firm, you will deliver from other 
sources using hourly non-firm, which is the lowest priority of transmission 
and subject to getting cut.  You may want to consider doing this on 
best/reasonable efforts basis.  (Also, even if you purchase 
daily/monthly/yearly firm to serve third parties, if you change the point of 
receipt or point of delivery temporarily, your request is treated as 
non-firm.)
12.4--Currently VEPCO is interested in joining the Alliance ISO (an RTO that 
has not been approved by FERC yet--competing ISO to Midwest ISO), but since 
FERC has not approved any RTO for VEPCO yet, there could be significant 
changes in the transmission charges/methods of obtaining 
transmission/grandfathering of current transmission, etc during this 
contract.  Make sure with the ENA attorneys that this out/increase in price 
covers that circumstance.
Underlying tranmission rates on VEPCO or any other provider can change at 
most any time, subject to the provider filing a rate case.  Therefore, any 
current transmission rates shown on OASIS are not necessarily what you will 
pay over the term of any transmission that Enron may purchase to serve this 
contract.  Generally, transmission providers will not agree to fixed rates.

Christi--

This is the note that I received on Tuesday June 13.  This is a relatively 
early draft of the PPA.

I think that we still have to purchase the land associated with the sites and 
do the due diligence on the site with regards to some of the siting issues.  
IN addition, in NC we are going to get a CPCN to site the plant to speed up 
the regulatory process in the NCUC.  I think that this will make the issue 
less contentious because of the NCUC's acceptance of the Dynegy plant at 
Rockingham that had a PPA with Duke Power.  

Using the Dynegy plant as a guideline, their only stumbling block was their 
gas agreeement.  They built a bypass off Transco.  We would be taking gas 
from the LDC of Rocky Mount.  Having talked with the regulatory folks at the 
NCUC who handle gas issues, this is the preferred route.  So, I do not think 
that we have any major state issues.  I think that right now we are simply 
working on some of the siting issues.

That being said, I will let you take a look at the PPA and let me know or 
Jeff Keenan (or even Heather Kroll or Ozzie Pagan) if you think that there 
are some transmission issues or other issues on the federal level.  

Thanks.

Lisa:  Attached is a draft of the Power Purchase Agreement with VEPCO, based 
on the current version of the term sheet.  In preparing the draft, we did 
encounter several additional questions for Enron's consideration.  These are 
noted with brackets and, in some cases, italicized notes, in the draft and 
are also highlighted below.  You may want to address these issues before this 
goes to VEPCO.

Cover and first page-- Should the party to the agreement (for the moment) be 
ENA or a special purpose company?

Definitions--  We included a defined term "Emergency Start-Up" (a start up or 
increase in energy scheduled during a day) and a place in Exhibit A to 
include a price for this, although this was not covered in the term sheet.

Section 2.2--  We included a provision for VEPCO to take test energy (energy 
charge only; no demand charge)--do you want this?

Section 2.3--  This was taken from the term sheet, but is it correct that COD 
will be July 1 (since the demand charge is supposed to start June 1?)  Also, 
it would be best to define "commencement of construction" to avoid 
controversy down the road.  We could either do this now or put in a 
placeholder that indicates it needs to be defined or be silent, whichever is 
your preference.  Also, bear in mind that we have not included a specific 
remedy (e.g., liquidated damages) if the Seller does not achieve that 
milestone on time.  Under the default provision (Section 8.1(c)), there would 
be a 30 day period to cure before Buyer could terminate (extendible to 90 
days if a longer period of time is needed and Seller diligently pursues the 
cure).  Would you prefer the right to pay ld's and extend the time period?

Section 3.1(b)--  Should the 1400 hour limitation apply to all sales under 
this PPA or only sales from the Facility?  I.e., would you use this Agreement 
to sell to VEPCO power in addition to what would be available from the 
Facility?  Also, is this a calendar year limitation--i.e., could they take 
1400 hours in the period June-Dec. 2001 or does the 1400 hours need to be 
pro-rated for the first year?

Section 3.4-- Since this is not a base load plant, the normal definition of 
Availability as the number of hours in a year of operations compared to the 
total hours in the year would not seem to be applicable.  Instead, we stated 
that the Facility would be capable of being available 92% of the year (other 
than due to Force Majeure and 336 hours (2 weeks) of scheduled 
maintenance)--i.e., that if they tried to schedule it, it is expected to be 
available.  Is that what Enron intended?  Additionally, the term sheet stated 
that a remedy for failure to meet Availability would need to be agreed--why 
wouldn't cost of cover damages be appropriate? Also, please note that we 
included language stating that Seller will not perform maintenance during 
peak periods.

Section 3.5(b)-- Please note the bracketed language re taking Blocks of 
Energy.  We have 50 MW minimum blocks but the capacity is 223--should we 
allow the last Block to be 23 if they've scheduled all the rest?

Section 3.5(c)-- Please see the bracketed language at the end of this Section.

Section 4.7-- Should there a required minimum take of Energy?

Article 6-- The Genco/Santee Cooper form of PPA we used as a model did not 
have any provisions on metering.  (See placeholder note in Article 6.)  Do 
you want to add such a provision, ignore it or just include a placeholder for 
now?

Section 9.1-- Is 30 days from invoice correct for the payment due date or 
would you prefer a shorter period?

Article 15-- The Genco/Santee Cooper form had mediation as a required step 
prior to arbitration.  Should we keep that?  Also, the form of arbitration is 
"baseball" arbitration--i.e.,  the arbitrators have to chose one party's 
position or the other's.  Is that what you want?

Section 16.2--  We used New York for governing law, on the premise that it 
will be difficult to get VEPCO to agree to Texas law and we would not 
recommend Virginia law for this contract.

Exhibit A-- There are a number of questions on the pricing exhibit--please 
see the bracketed notes therein.

Please call and let us know how you would like to proceed on this draft.

Looks like you have some extra text in the headings for items 14 & 15, for
the other software package.

John,
*   GE can sign this version of the consolidation agreement (Brian can
edit the headings for 14 & 15).
*   The last versions of the On & Off Shore agreements can be signed
(Those with Brain's 12/Jun/00).
*   The "Letter (Termination) Agreement" can be signed (The version with
K. Mann's 13/Jun/00).
Please advise status of GEIOC signature on Consolidation Agreement and
On-Shore Contract

Regards,

Sorry guys:

I added the clause on the Parent Guarantee and without thinking, made it a
GE
obligation.  It was supposed to be an Enron requirement.  So I have
corrected
that in Clause 15.  GE already has the same obligation in the Contracts.

John Schroeder:  This will be the Version that we execute, so please forward
this one to your guy in Mexico.

20 was all I could find.  I saw where Reagan could get it on 29.  I'll call

We had to go to Don's "event" yesterday, so that was rather difficult on 
Ric.  He's doing pretty good, trying to take it a day at a time.  I worked on 
notecards all weekend.  I have your blow up and also need to know if you want 
your cards in matte or glossy (I have samples).  The glossy ones are $3 
each.  That paper is so expensive that I had to go up on the price.  The blow 
up looks great and it's $10.00.

How does everybody look for a discussion concerning the VEPCO interconnection 
agreement on Tuesday, Sept 19?

I've checked with Christi, Mitch and Reagan, so they don't need to confirm.

Details to follow...

Thanks,

Kay

Power Assets is currently Sheila's group, pre-reorg.

You'll have to introduce her.  Who will she be working with.  Who is Power

Kathleen was my legal assistant at EECC, and I recommended her for the job.  
I think you'll like her. I've worked with a few, and she's one of the best.  
Works hard, logical, No silly stuff, no meaningless fluff, gets the job done.

Long conference calls make me happy about having email.

Do you want Brian/Lisa/anyone else commercial?

Good morning!  I'm on a lenghthy conference call but I think we should rally 
the troops.  Steve Swift has confirmed that al;l at GE are prepaared for a 
call tomorrow at 1:30pm Houston time.  Could you get our guys assembled?  I 
have one meeting for 30 minutes at 3pm.  Otherwise I'm available.  Thanks!

How about meeting in advance of tomorrow's 130 phone call to discuss the 
approach we want to take with GE?  

I'm suggesting 400 this afternoon.  Please let me know how this works for you.

Thanks,

Kay

I should have included you also.  Are you available?

Hi Karen,

I'm looking at a version which was faxed on Sept 13.  If this the final 
version?  Expecting the answer to be "yes", I am reviewing it now.

Kay

I suppose a location would help! Location TBD, I'll make sure you get a 
call.  Kay

   

I will be there if you tell me where!  Thanks for the invite.

This is the most current information I have on specifications. 

I sent Ben and Mike an email about the 12th slot, but haven't heard from 
either one of them.

By the way, I was asking about whether the changes I had suggested for the 
transformer contract had been included in the Calumet equipment purchase  
terms, as I was confident the changes are in this agreement.

My understanding is that Illinois is the only one, unless enovate will have 
employees or inventory in any other states.  It is my understanding that it 
will not.

I'm going to work really hard this week to see if I can catch up a bit, and 
take a day off soon.

I've been through several 4th quarters and YIKES is right!  You better try 
and take some time off before then or you aren't going to get it.  I'm glad 
we are going in October to Las Vegas.  

	Kay Mann@ENRON

Just wait for the 4th quarter.  YIKES.

I know you can silly.  Marty said he wouldn't be coming since he's 
transitioning to EES.  Rose said she'd try and Lisa said yes.  I left VMs for 
Scott and Brian along with the emails.  Sheila will be there too.

It's meeting city today between you and Dan.

I can come!

No surprises with CW.  She's very nice to me, but she does like to keep very 
specific hours.  I get the impression that leaving 15 minutes past 5 really 
bothers her.  Just watch, and see. 

She told you she'd be there, but she didn't know where to go.  I get a bit of 
attitude here  Didn't you say she was no nonsense.  Oh, and get this, Mary 
Cook has asked if Chaundra has made up the list for assistants willing to 
work overtime for her yet.  Apparently, Chaundra won't do the OT.  I only do 
OT for my people, and I can't believe she doesn't have a better work ethic.

Suzanne, x37340

Karen,

I don't run across many people without email these days. Big hassle.  It is 
so much easier to check for certain issues with an electronic copy.

I'm looking for the Fehr option, but the latest I have on my computer is the 
version I emailed to you on August 30th.  Is there a more up-to-date version, 
and if so, could you please mail it to me?

Thanks,

Kay

Kay:
The Village's attorney drafted the agreement and therefore we do not have an
electronic version -- unfortunately, he does not have email either.  The
redlined version you are reviewing now reflects only minor changes from that
originally executed by ENA approximately a month ago.  Please let me know if
I can be of any assistance.  Thanks!

Good.  I feel better.  I just don't think we owe them enough yet.

I have forwarded it to all of Enron and PMR&W so that we can continue to be 
over-billed.

Stuart

It is mainly a tax issue (whether we have to pay franchise tax), and ENA Tax 
says we don't need to register.  At least that's how I understood it.  I'll 
double check.  

We can do the name change and register later.  That's no problem.

Kay

09/18/2000 03:39 PM
I don't really know what it means to be "registered" in a state.  I know that 
we intend to transact with customers located in all the states I mentioned.  
If we only register in Illinois and we transact with a customer in Iowa is 
that a problem?  

Here's the attachment.

Brian D Barto@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
06/15/2000 04:27 PM
Sorry guys:

I added the clause on the Parent Guarantee and without thinking, made it a GE 
obligation.  It was supposed to be an Enron requirement.  So I have corrected 
that in Clause 15.  GE already has the same obligation in the Contracts.  

John Schroeder:  This will be the Version that we execute, so please forward 
this one to your guy in Mexico.

Here are my observations:

I agree with Rusty re: the put option complicating things for us.  Second, 
there has to be an absolute end to this agreement at some point. If we want 
to have an automatic extension by commencing construction, there still needs 
to be a date certain after which we can go forward without them no matter 
what.  In other words, if we want to add the language Rusty suggested, it 
should be limited to x months after the expiration of the option agreement.  
We'll need to run this back through Accounting.

I really don't like the inclusion of the language in paragraph 5. If we add 
the language requested in paragraph 5, we need to run this agreement back 
through Accounting, and we may need to add some other additional language.  

I don't know if Rusty and Fred think we may need a zoning change for this 
parcel.

Kay

  

Rusty Stevens
09/14/2000 04:45 PM
I am in receipt of the Fehr's comments to our option agreement.  In reviewing 
them, I have the following comments:

The paragraph (2) change that says they can compel us to buy their land upon 
a Triggering Event occurring is not going to work, because this is a put 
option on their part which hurts our hard cost avoidance issues.  We 
carefully reworded previous put option language to avoid this.    Also, how 
can we be bound to a deal when the agreement has expired ?  I think we would 
need to say that "if we decide to build the plant after the option period 
expires, then that would serve to extend the term of this agreement, however, 
if the option agreement expires unexercised for a one year period then we 
won't be bound to the deal.  

If the provisions of his comment (5) are indeed parallel to another similar 
paragraph in the document I don't have a problem with it, but "specific 
performance" scares me in general.  Your (collective) call.

Lets wrap this one up fast.  I want to resolve it soon so I can use it as 
leverage with Ledford and not have him influence them.  He picked a good to 
go on vacation, but is back in on Monday.  I also told the Fehr's that if we 
could do this before the 15th I would go for $185,000 vs. $175,000.  Since we 
were about five days longer than promised, I can justify the delay to end of 
next week, but I don't want them to think I was just blowing smoke on the 
extra $10,000.

Fred :  Refresh my memory on who I need to go to for the option payment check 
?

Due to a last minute conflict, we need to reschedule this meeting.  How does 
everybody look for Wednesday?

Sorry for any inconvenience.

Kay

The meeting regarding the above-referenced subject will be held tomorrow, 
September 19, 2000, at 9:00 a.m. in 20C2.  Refreshments will be served.

Nancy, Kay, et al. will call you in the morning.  

Karen,

Please send me the revised version with the language you believe reflects 
Rusty's suggestion. Otherwise, I will have to go to Accounting twice.

Please email me with the specific performance language you want to add to 
meet their request.

Thank you,

Kay

As soon as I get a redline, I'll get it to Accounting and we can go forward 
quickly.  I will also process the Virgil and Joan Ledford deal at the same 
time.  I just had a meeting cancel for tomorrow, which will help.

Rusty Stevens
09/18/2000 04:29 PM
Kay,

We are in agreement on the x months date certain that the document needs to 
end.  I have suggested that we propose one year.  If we dont extend the deal 
for a second 18 month term, this actually ends the deal before the 3 year 
overall contemplated date.  

As to running it back through Accounting, I had hoped that we could avoid 
that since its still not an obligation that we have except as a result of our 
actions to begin construction of a facility, so as I see it there's no change 
from the previous structure - its not a put - its an automatic call.  

If I haven't talked you into it yet, and you feel it does need to go past 
accounting again, please ask them to hurry since we have an incentive to get 
it done quickly.

I dont recall what the paragraph 5 changes were, but we are in fact spending 
a lot of time with Karen at this time to get the zoning approved at Pontiac.  
This is why we are in a hurry.  We have to go for our zoning hearing on 
October 5th and we know we are going to be asked about the two nearby houses 
- Fehr and Ledford - and we want to be able to stand up and say that we too 
were concerned about the impact on those residents and that we have 
negotiated for the purchase of those homes so disturbance will be minimized.

I also don't want Mr. Ledford - who just got back from vacation - to go talk 
to the Fehr's in the next day or so and make them re-think the deal we've 
gotten done with them.

I know you're getting pulled in a lot of directions, and I appreciate the 
help.

   

Here are my observations:

I agree with Rusty re: the put option complicating things for us.  Second,

Kay--as indicated in my voicemail, I will definitely be out of pocket on 
Wednesday.  The meeting is supposed to go into Thursday and I fly back Thurs 
eve, but it is possible that it would finish up early enough on Thursday that 
I could schedule a call for Thursday afternoon.  I'll call you later.

Allyson,

Here is a very recent version of the PPA:

Kay

Hi Sara,

I believe we still have an interest in using an Enron form as a go by for the 
Enron/Peoples activities.  If you can give me what you are comfortable with, 
I will make sure it is transmitted with the appropriate caveats, 
confidentiality restrictions, etc. 

Thanks,

Kay

Here tis.

We'll be turning a new draft to Peoples today or tomorrow, but I figure it 
needs to go to Allyson now.

Kay

Allyson,

Here is a very recent version of the PPA:

Kay

Hi Cle,

We need a revolving loan agreement between Midwest (now enovate) and Enron.  
Please call me at your convenience to discuss (713 345 7566).

Thanks,

Kay

Any time is good for me.

Hi there,

Any luck with the form to work with on the affilate/epc/97 10 compliant 
contract?  

Thanks,

Kay

Hi Allyson,

Someone was asking which of the information we have filed is public 
information.  Is the petition itself public?  What else would be public?

I know this is a variation to the "what is confidential" question. Once 
again, your assistance is appreciated.

Kay

Hi Kay,

I hate to admit this, but I need another copy of whatever confidentiality 
agreement we have with Virginia Power.

Thanks again,

Kay

This may be our best bet.
The Application itself is public.  The testimony is public.  Without going
back through the material we have supplied (which I would be happy to do, if
you like), the primary material that was confidential was the cost data and
supporting work papers.  Also, the engineering plan we filed recently in
response to a data request was confidential.

Let me know if you would like me to walk back through it more specifically.

Hi Heather,

The confidentiality agreement signed by Enron/Vepco states as follows:

Except as required by law, neither party hereto nor their representatives 
will disclose to any person either the fact that discussions or negotiations 
are taking place between them not any terms, conditions or other fact with 
respect to any transaction that may be proposed or undertaken, including the 
status thereof.
  
We can loosen up the terms in the contract so that we can disclose certain 
terms to potential investors (I'll make that change), or we can discuss 
amending this agreement.  Additionally, it looks like we have the testimony 
and application filed with the Public Staff to work with.

Kay

One more thing.  Did someone send you copies of equipment contracts?  Those 
have confidentiality provisions which need to be considered.  Therefore, 
please advise what you received from Enron in that regard.

I was under the impression that most of what we were submitting we were 
submitting as confidential information, specifically including the responses 
to the Public Staff's data requests.  I don't recall the specifics at this 
point.

Thanks again,

Kay

Kay

I don't know what I have in mind.  Austin?  Palacios?  

I'm still struggling with the concept that if we see my parents for a 
holiday, we have to include your mom, or vice versa.  That just wasn't how it 
worked in our family growing up - we typically spent holidays with one or the 
other, rarely with both. I'm trying to figure out the rules.

I haven't heard from St Francis yet.  

Kay

I would think so. What do you have in mind?

Anything from St F? I haven't followed up with after school care there. I
don't have the information they sent. Do you?

Here's a question.  If we have Thanksgiving dinner in Houston with your
mom, would we have flexibility to do something afterwards?

Just checking...

This is a very rough draft based on an agreement done previously with a jv 
company.  I'm sending it for Enron review only, since I haven't even read the 
entire thing yet.  I thought you might want to take a look at it to see what 
you think, and to consider the scope of the services to be provided.

As for legal services, one alternative would be to have the services provided 
by an outside law firm, not associated with either principal.

Could you forward me what you received from Clement regarding the corporate 
guaranty issue?  I would like to see what's the latest in that regard.

Thanks,

Kay

I think all of us who deal with assets are running across confidentiality 
hurdles in all kinds of agreements, including confidentiality agreements.  In 
short, our business people need the ability to disclose agreements to 
potential purchasers of projects, contracts and assets, and not all of our 
forms allow this.

I'm trying to include an exception for "potential lenders and investors" 
whenever I can (instead of just lenders). Does someone have a more artful or 
effective solution?  

Just wanted to share the thought so that more eyes could be watching for the 
issue.

Kay

Some thoughts, observations, suggestions:

1. Advantages to the single contract:

Don't need a consolidation agreement, so we don't have to negotiate one.
Better from a liability standpoint.
Easier to administer.

Is there any reason we can't go with a single contract?

2. Repayment/prepayment

I'm working with Steve on the letter agreement.

3.  Assignment to Mitsui

Steve is confirming payment issues, and ability to comply with GE's requested 
payment within 3 days of executing the contract.  This means that the 
assignment and assumption needs to be executed contemporaneously with the GE 
contract.  I have a call in to Rob Stevens to verify, in Stan's absence.  
Peggy is checking on this, also.

4. Parent guaranty.

GE is requesting an Enron parent guaranty.  From a quick review of the draft 
contract, it appears that a change in language will be necessary, since the 
current version only requires a parent guaranty in the case of an assignment 
to a certain class of assignees.  If I am correct, then I suggest consider 
inserting new language that the parent guaranty will be due 30 days after 
execution of the contract, so that Mitsui can provide the guaranty, if 
necessary.

Jeff and Reynaldo Garcia spoke on this subject at length, and Rey convinced 
Jeff that spitting was necessary.  AT that time the Enron Contracting entity 
was not specified to be Energia...    If you want to unsplit the documents it 
will add additional time in excess geting a consolidation agreement completed 
I think.  Please include Rey in your quest for closure.  PS  GE is now OK 
with the split.

I need help getting closure on the Consolidation Agreement.  I hope that we 
do not invent other issues as well.

Will do.

Would you please call Mitcha and get the relevant information?  I suppose 
that a demand letter (under the warranty?) could be in order but any 
pre-litigation moves need to be coordinated with Richard Sanders.  Maybe this 
hasn't risen to that level yet, but $12 Million sounds pretty serious.  

	HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--In the latest update of Enron Corp.'s (ENE, news, msgs) 
bandwidth trading activities, the company's chairman said Tuesday that it has 
completed about 90 trades of telecommunications bandwidth. 
	Speaking at the Dain Rauscher Energy 2000 Conference, Enron Chairman Ken Lay 
talked about the current status and futures plans the company has for 
bandwidth trading and broadband services. 
	Asked what kind of company Enron is, Lay gave an answer that shows the recent 
expansion of the company's business strategy beyond energy. Enron is still 
basically "an energy and broadband company," he said. 
	While energy is still the source of most of Enron's revenue, Lay's answer 
underlines the growth potential it sees in broadband services and bandwidth 
trading. A number of Enron officials have been quoted in the last year as 
saying that, in a few years, it could be making as much money from those 
areas as it now makes from its lucrative natural gas and power businesses. 
	Enron plans to spend $600 million-$650 million this year and about the same 
amount over the next two to three years on broadband and bandwidth trading, 
Lay said. It will spend more during that time if necessary. 
	In fact, the company is planning to sell energy assets around the world in 
emerging markets that aren't growing quickly enough to meet Enron's 
standards. Proceeds will be deployed into businesses like broadband and 
bandwidth trading, which are growing more quickly, he said. 
	In pioneering bandwidth trading as a commodity, Enron's 90 bandwidth deals 
put it far ahead of competitors in that nascent market area. El Paso Energy 
Corp. (EPG, news, msgs) officials have said they have done 5-10 bandwidth 
trades this year. Companies like Williams Communications Group (WCG, news, 
msgs) won't talk about the number of bandwidth trades they have made. 
	Bandwidth is the capacity to move data between two points on a 
telecommunications network. 
	Enron will finish deploying its domestic telecommunications network by the 
end of this year, Lay said. Some of the fiber-optic network will be lit, or 
made operational, this year with the rest to be lit later. 
	The company has four bandwidth trading pooling points completed in New York, 
Los Angeles, Las Vegas and London. Enron's current plans call for a total of 
13 pooling points. 
	Bandwidth trading pooling points are facilities where telecom carriers can 
connect to each other to allow data to flow from one carrier to another, 
facilitating bandwidth trading. 
	Enron plans to begin delivering movies to home via broadband connections in 
December as part of its deal with Blockbuster Video and a number of telecom 
carriers. 
	The deal is a 20-year exclusive, worldwide deal with a potential contract 
value of more than $1 billion to Enron, according to materials the company 
handed out at the conference.

Hi Guys,

I'm trying to figure out what info we submitted from which turbine 
contracts.  Could someone please identify the contract and what was sent to 
Allyson?

Thanks,

Kay

Gregg,

Sheila was telling me that Enron has an ISDA agreement with Peoples, and 
there's some guaranty language there, also.  I'll try to track this down.

Kay

ps I've asked Sara for the ISDA agreement.  I'll let you know when I get it.

I have not received anything from Clement regarding the corporate guaranty 
issue.  He recently worked on a guaranty for a deal with Alliance.  I don't 
know where we stand on either an umbrella guaranty or third parties.  Any 
thoughts or assistance is greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Gregg

   
	
	

This is a very rough draft based on an agreement done previously with a jv 
company.  I'm sending it for Enron review only, since I haven't even read the 
entire thing yet.  I thought you might want to take a look at it to see what 
you think, and to consider the scope of the services to be provided.

As for legal services, one alternative would be to have the services provided 
by an outside law firm, not associated with either principal.

Could you forward me what you received from Clement regarding the corporate 
guaranty issue?  I would like to see what's the latest in that regard.

Thanks,

Kay

So do you know where the piece of the contract came from?  Maybe we can track

Hi Karen,

Our accounting contact is leaving tomorrow at 100, so it would be helpful to 
get this information as soon as possible.  It would also help if you could 
send a redline against the version I had sent you, as this was the last draft 
reviewed by Accounting.

Thanks,

Kay

Karen,

Please send me the revised version with the language you believe reflects 
Rusty's suggestion. Otherwise, I will have to go to Accounting twice.

Please email me with the specific performance language you want to add to 
meet their request.

Thank you,

Kay

Nancy,

I knew you were thinking about it, so I didn't worry. 

I'm monkeying around the PPA, only because I had a meeting with Ozzie and 
Heather late last night.  Will you be picking up emails in the next day or 
so?  I can forward you what I've done for your review.

We need to get a Enron/BP dialogue going concerning the lease with the City 
of Rocky Mount.  When do you want to discuss this (or have us discuss it with 
the right B & P person)?

Thanks,

Kay

I forgot to reply to this.  Just let me know when you want to discuss it.  
I'll jot down some thoughts on risk issues in the meantime.  

>>> <Kay.Mann@enron.com> 09/15/00 02:30PM >>>
Here at Enron the lawyers generate risk memos in connection with
transactions, summarizing the more important legal risks in a deal.  I've
been taking notes along the way, but I will be asking you for your thoughts
here shortly.  A discussion will be all I'm looking for at this time.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay,

Would you say that Travis McCullough was just a tad tipsy (to the point of 
being intoxicated) at the Law Conference?  Carlos does not believe me.

Kathleen

This is helpful to know, and we all need to discuss.

I got your message earlier about the order on the extension of time, but
didn't recall that the order dealt with the due date for rebuttal
testimony.  Since you said you were going to call Sammy Kirby anyway, I
didn't call back.

We had a meeting today to try to finalize our testimony.  We plan to let
you see it before we file it.  To start with, we do not want to reveal
any confidential information and secondly, Enron may be able to offer
input into the solutions for our concerns that would obviate any
official disagreements.

We currently have two alternative recommendations in our testimony.  One
gives Enron (EDC) a certificate conditioned on it filing a signed PPA
and evidence showing it has a long-term right to have its plant on the
site (such as a lease with Rocky Mount).  The other alternative doesn't
give you the certificate until you file those things, we review them,
etc..  We currently are favoring the first one and I'm sure Enron would
prefer the first one.

The control of the site is a little bit problematic.  In the
application, you say Enron has an option on the land.  In a data
response, you say you intend to give it (or sell it) to Rocky Mt. and
that it will own the land.  However, no arrangements have apparently
been made for Enron to have a long-term right to keep the plant on the
site. We have no objection to Rocky Mt. owning the land.  I hope that is
clear.  But we do have a problem with giving a certificate to Enron if
Enron has no long term right to be on the land.  (Control of the site
has always been one of the cornerstones of the requirements.  It is hard
to award a certificate for the construction of a plant on the basis of a
definite need for the capacity if the owner of the land could require
the plant owner to dismantle the thing the next year.)  This is
something that could be met later - after the order had gone out, if
Enron doesn't have a problem with that.  I can't imagine Enron being
willing to invest much money in the plant before it has a long term
lease or other arrangement.  It may be enough for your witness to state
that it won't give up the option or the ownership of the land unless and
until it has a long-term lease (or whatever).

Another issue is the status of EDC.  Your amendment says you're going to
create an LLC. EDC needs to exist before the certificate is awarded
because obviously we can't award a certificate to a nonexistent person. 
You don't need to file anything necessarily, but we need a showing
before the hearing that EDC has been or very shortly will be created. We
also need some assurance that Enron will capitalize EDC properly, which
I could get by asking your witness a couple of questions, if that is the
easiest way to do it. (This is not a big deal, but necessary to dot all
the i's and cross all the t's.)

Bob Hinton has been trading calls with Kay Mann (spelling?) about the
creation of the LLC and maybe some other things.  I wanted you to know
about these issues also, however, to keep you in the loop and also
because you may can get things done a little faster!

The only other issue is a rather complicated one.  Under the terms of
the PPA as currently drafted, Enron has until 10/31/01 to complete
construction, unless specifically excused. (This is in section 2.3.) If
Enron hasn't completed construction and declared Commercial Operation
before 10/31/01 (as extended due to excusable delays), then Enron has to
buy rights in Vepco's control area to capacity equal to the contract
capacity within 30 days.  If Enron doesn't fulfill that obligation,
Vepco, in its sole discretion, can terminate the Agreement.

Because Enron filed this application on the basis of the Vepco contract
and also because we do not have any guidelines on merchant plants yet,
we are using the contract (even though it is so short term) to justify
the need and hence the certificate.  (Otherwise, I'm afraid we go off
into a quagmire in terms of how to define a definite need in this brave
new world.  Obviously, Enron doesn't have time to wait until the generic
issues are resolved.)  Because the contract can be terminated however we
are uncomfortable with an open-ended certificate.  By rule, QF contracts
have to be renewed (rejustified) after five years if construction (isn't
begun or completed - I don't remember which).  We've taken the same
position by analogy except for a shorter amount of time with other
certificates, although I don't think we've officially had to take the
position.  (We told the Power Agency its certificate for this site was
too old, for example.)  We are leaning toward taking the position that
if the plant hasn't achieved commercial operation by November 30th (to
take into account the extra 30 days Vepco gives Enron to get rights to
capacity), unless excused, then the certificate expires and Enron will
have to rejustify it. We've discussed tying it to "significant
construction" having occurred, but anything other than commercial
operation is too subjective. We've also discussed having the certificate
become null and void, but thought that sounded too harsh and was perhaps
unfair if construction was well under way.  You may remember the
LG&E-Westmoreland Partners case, in which its first plant (ROVA I) gave
its QF host to a sister plant, with the first plant becoming an EWG (and
not a QF).  It basically had to rejustify its certificate and the
Commission reissued the certificate.  The construction of that plant was
well along at the time.

I hope to have a copy of our testimony to you early Thursday.  I know it
can take awhile to get through all the channels at Enron, but that's
probably as early as I can do it.  (I'll try for Wednesday p.m., but I
think that is too optimistic.)  We'd prefer to work things out or at
least reduce the degree and/or extent of any disagreements.  Please let
me know what Enron can or wants to do on the PPA, the option/lease, and
the creation of EDC. Supplemental testimony prefiled or done from the
stand would work on the latter two as would cross-examination.  For the
first one, we need a signed contract before the order goes out at the
VERY latest.  It would be nice to have it before the hearing..

I need to set up a conference call with the outside lawyer who will be 
drafting the lease (and other docs).  Who would like to participate in the 
call?

How about Thursday am?

Thanks,

Kay

Kay:

Nancy Wodka asked me to research whether parties to a contract governed by 
Virginia law may negotiate to limit their liability under such contract.  The 
answer is yes.  Because the parties (within broad parameters) can make just 
about whatever law they like so long as it doesn't violate public policy, 
etc., Virginia freely allows limitation of liability clauses.  Of course, in 
the case of fraud or material misrepresentation in inducement, etc., no court 
would honor the clause, but that circumstance does not apply to us.

Please let me know if you need anything further.

Kay:  Braden supplied the exhaust stacks for the eight GE 7EA machines in 
Illinois.  They are preparing to submit their letter of credit so they can 
get paid the final 5%.  It is to be valid through the end of the warranty 
period.  I will make sure that the dates work.  Please tell me if you approve 
of this form of LOC.  The purchase order requires Braden to:  "provide an 
irrevocable, on demand, letter of credit ... issued by a U.S. bank acceptble 
to Buyer, with a credit rating of A or better and with a validity period 
through the completion of the 12 month warranty  period.

I am also sending this form to Robin Veariel.

Robin, (i) is it ok that an affiliate of Braden is issuing the LOC?;
              (ii) is the bank issuing this LOC worth a flip?; and
              (iii) any comments on the form?

Gavin:  Are they done delivering everything, and what LD's are they into?  
They  have submitted all of their invoices and we are holding the last 5% 
pending completion of work, receipt of lien waiver and LOC.  LD's paid are 
not a condition to releasing the retention, so you should try to close them 
out before they get all their cash in hand. Drawing LDs against the LOC would 
deplete the funds available for warranty work if you ever needed them for 
that.

Curtis Hicks <CHICKS@braden.com> on 06/16/2000 03:36:45 PM
Brian,

Attached please review and advise acceptance for the revised draft LOC. We
have eliminated the effective date being subject to receipt of final
payment. Hopefully this draft LOC is acceptable. If so, Braden could issue
the formal LOC early next week.

Kay,

What is your phone number?  We will try to call about noon.

Reagan

Maybe we give it a couple of hours.  I'm getting nervous, but I tell myself 
that whatever works out will be for the best.

No problem.  I got some comments from Accounting, but I'm fine if you want it 
to go out with the caveat that Enron has a couple of minor administrative 
points to clear up.

Kay

I know I'm repeating myself...thank you, thank you, thank you....

Hi again,

I accidentally deleted the emails you sent me about Gleason.  Could you 
resend them?

Thanks,

Kay

I'm working as fast as I can.  Things connect together, so it takes a little 
while.  I think I'm about done with the hard stuff.

Hi Matt,

We have an LLC which should  be signing a contract soon.  I believe the name 
as filed was Edgecomb Development, but it should be Edgecombe Development, 
LLC, named for the county in which the power plant will be built.  Can you 
take care of getting this changed officially?

This may sound silly, but our customer looked up the official records and 
pointed this out, so we need to fix it. Also, we have told the State that the 
name is Edgecombe.

Many thanks,

Kay

I spoke with Bob Henson.  His questions were: ownership of LLC (I'm getting 
the documents) and status of PPA.

Kay

Yikes.  I think I'd still rather be a woman, although now I can't remember 
why I feel that way.

Got anything?  Should have been signed this year.

Thanks,

Kay

I think the LLC agreement would be a big help.  Thanks!

Matt Maxwell on 09/20/2000 04:04:24 PM
The certificate of formation will not change.  The certified  Certificate of 
Correction will be attached to it.  The original Certificate will never be 
changed.  I asked this exact question this afternoon.

The Certificate of Correction will be filed with Delaware tomorrow and we can 
expedite an original to be delivered to us on Friday.  I am running out the 
door.  Leave me any instructions re additional needs/questions/problems.  My

This Friday - Michael goes for a visit at  St. Francis, which may be his new 
school (so far, so good).  I'll be in around1000

Most Fridays I'm going to TRY to pick Michael up since I'm away so much, 
which means leaving by 445 or so.

October 4, ENA orientation in the am.

October 19/20, Neil is out of town, so I have to pick Michael up from school 
(leave at 430)

October 26/27, hope to be vacation time.  Neil has a meeting in San Antonio 
(usually it is in Miami, San Francisco, Phoenix - not so great this year).  
It is the officer's meeting for Enterprise, and spouses are invited.  This 
means we won't be in town for the Compaq thing. Figures, of course.  Thanks 
for asking.

I'm watching for some good vacation days, also...

We are staying at the Hyatt Hill Country Resort, which is nice.  There will 
be a private party as SeaWorld, which could be fun. They usually do 
everything first class all the way, since it is the officers shindig.  I get 
to see some nice people I only see once a year.  Everyone parties hard, too.

Diet time!  I've done ok so far, considering the travel.  This means I've 
lost the weight I gained when I was on the road every week.

ckm

I will put this on our calendars.  Too bad you won't make the Compaq thing, 
but maybe next year.  San Antonio, wow what a let down from the other 
cities.  That will be a nice time of year though.  I can recommend some good 
restaurants since I took Ric there last year for his birthday.  We stayed at 
the Menger and had a great time.

fyi/review/comment

I have a couple of questions so I can wrap up the LOI:

We refer to licensed Fuel Cell Energy equipment.  Do we intend to reference a 
particular manufacturer, or should this be more generic?

Do we want to attach a draft of the Development Agreement, and condition the 
final deal on agreeing to terms substantially the same as what's in the 
draft?  I have a concern that the Enron optionality bug could bite us on the 
backside with that one.

Do we expect to have ONE EPC contract, or several?  

I'm looking for the confidentiality agreement, which may be in Bart's files 
(haven't checked closely yet).  If anyone has it handy, it could speed things 
up for me.

Thanks,

Kay

Forget the ONE or more contract questions.  I see we expect to have separate 
contracts for each project.

On the issue of the contracts, the draft says that the $170m is paid when the 
EPC contract is signed.  Are we expecting that the portion attributable to 
each project will be paid as the individual EPC contracts are signed?

Thanks,

Kay

   
	
	

1.  The pricing that we have given CRRA is specific to FuelCell Energy and 
would not be meaningful without listing the manufacturer (i.e., ONSI would be 
a lot more money).  Hence, I think that we have to reference the manufacturer.

2.  The attachment of the Development Agreement is a Jeff question.  In order 
to mark any 2000 income, we will need to get CRRA to execute the Development 
Agreement in 2000.  In my opinion, we should show CRRA a copy of the LOI with 
the assumption that the Development Agreement is attached.  I would actually 
send them the draft Development Agreement a couple days after the LOI.  Based 
on how CRRA reacts, I would make an ultimate determination if the agreement 
needs to be attached to the LOI.  

3.  I expect at least one EPC contract per project.  We don't want to 
condition the acceptance of one project on the performance of another 
project.  Performance tests will either be performed on a project basis or a 
unit by unit basis in a given project.

Remarkably clear explanation.

Ben,

Does ENA wish to accept Title of 14 LM6000's on September 26, 2000, or accept 
Title of these Units after each has been issued an Inspection Acceptance 
Certificate from EECC QA/QC department?

The following is a summary of the LM6000 Title Transfer Question:

Mike Storm, GE/SSEP Project Manager, requested from me, on 9/19/00, to accept 
title of 14 LM6000's no later 9/26/00.  I informed him I was not authorized 
to make this decision and that I would contact the Owner to make the 
decision.  I further informed Mike Storm that our Owner would not accept 
those terms and a compromise must be worked out. 
Contract Reference 15.2.1 of contract 24-LM6K-2-99 states: title transfers 
when equipment is ready to ship to the delivery point and seller notifies 
purchaser of such event.
Delivery Point is defined as the SSEP storage yard.
SSEP has notified us that Units #1-14 are "Ready to Ship".
Contract Reference 10.2.3 of contract 24-LM6K-2-99 states: purchaser has the 
right to inspect the equipment for "completeness prior to loading on 
transport to delivery point".
We have inspected the first eleven Units and have informed SSEP that Units 
#1-14 ARE NOT COMPLETE and therefore are NOT at the Delivery Point.
FACT: Units # 1-11 are at the delivery point. #12-14 are at SSEP.
FACT: If we sent a truck to SSEP tomorrow, NONE of the UNITS would be "Ready 
to Ship" to a project site.
FACT: SSEP QA/QC has 15 Non Conformance Reports on these 14 turbines which 
need to be corrected before they are "Ready to Ship".
It is in the best interests for both companies to correct the Non 
Conformance's prior to shipment to the delivery point or project site.
RECOMMENDATION: I recommend that we DO NOT accept Title until the Units are 
actually ready to be shipped to a project site.  The problem is that NONE OF 
THE UNITS ARE READY TO SHIP!  SSEP has to work off punchlist items which 
their QA/QC department has listed on Non Conformance Reports.  At this 
juncture, no money can be withheld from SSEP. To ensure they will be fixed, 
Title should transfer after our QA/QC inspectors give written notice that 
each Unit is complete and ready to ship.  This will protect ENA on the 
quality of the machines, as well as, ensure that little or no "re-work" is 
performed in the field.

If you require further information or any assistance in this matter, please 
feel free to contact me at 713-646-8258.

Kay,
Below are the prices as well as the ex-work factory dates (ship dates).  As 
Ben
and Frank and I discussed last Friday this is what we need the option 
extension
to the 30th of June to reflect.  Please give me a call when you can.  We need 
to
get this done this PM if at all possible.  Frank and I will both be out of our
offices for the rest of the week and this will get very difficult.

Thanks

Ben,
     This note is based on the information provided to me earlier today by 
Mike
Sandridge and confirms what the adjusted values would be for each tarnsformer
type, making the following conditions:

1-The quantity of transformers released under the agreement would be decreased
to 10.
2-The option payments for the ten production slots have been deducted, as 
shown
below, along with the remaining net price / each transformer type.
3- Two of the $50,000 non-refundable optional production slot payments  are
cancelled. (LNL 9521-3 and 4)
4- In order to meet the terms of the latest agreement, the contract should be
signed by June 19,2000.  If that is not practical, at a minimum, the 10%
progress payment against the value of the contract would be due for wire
transfer immediately. That value would be 10% of $7,884,600 = $788,460.00.

     Therefore the Equipment Pricing Table is revised as shown below.

I think you and I may have different documents.  Maybe we should compare.

Thanks,

Kay

What time?

FYI.  Meeting is at 100
PLEASE, if possible, attend a 30-minute meeting today in 38C1.  I have a 
couple of announcements and I would like for everyone to clean off your desk 
and bring every single invoice you have to me.  Our existing procedures are 
not working now that Erica has left and we need to develop a new system.   If 
you can't attend, please see me as soon as possible.  Thanks!

Per your request.

FYI, no action requested at this time.

Lee, Chris and Kay:

Attached is a draft of the Change Order #3 for the Las Vegas Cogen project.
Kay, I will be in Houston on Monday through Wednesday afternoon, but will be
busy most of Tuesday.  Lee had hoped that we could get together, or at least
talk, about this and the facility agreement and payment for Change Order #2.
How is your late Monday afternoon looking?

Kent

Press Release

FuelCell Energy Signs First North American Distribution Agreement With PPL 
EnergyPlus

Strategic Distribution Alliance to Advance Sales of Fuel Cell Products for 
Distributed Generation Market

DANBURY, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 21, 2000-- FuelCell Energy, Inc. 
(NASDAQ: FCEL - news) has selected PPL EnergyPlus, LLC, a subsidiary of PPL 
Corp. (NYSE: PPL - news), as the first North American distributor of its 
Direct FuelCell(TM)(DFCc) products for the distributed generation market. The 
agreement facilitates commercialization of FuelCell Energy's DFCc products, 
which will be available for submegawatt commercial orders in the second half 
of 2001, and megawatt commercial orders in 2002. In addition, PPL has made an 
equity investment of approximately $10 million, or about one per cent of 
FuelCell Energy's equity and will order 1.25 megawatts of commercial field 
trial units in the next six months. 

In announcing the strategic alliance between the two firms, Jerry Leitman, 
president and CEO of FuelCell Energy, said, ``We're delighted to have PPL, a 
leading supplier of competitively priced electricity and energy services in 
the mid-Atlantic region, as our first distribution partner in North America. 
PPL is a successful company, with a solid growth strategy, and is highly 
qualified to penetrate the market for distributed generation solutions, 
through their energy marketing and services arm, PPL EnergyPlus. This 
agreement is the latest milestone attained in bringing our products to the 
stationary power marketplace.'' 

The DFCc power plant is especially well suited for a variety of distributed 
generation applications, including high reliability and power quality, 
cogeneration, opportunity fuels, environmental compliance and grid 
congestion. PPL is targeting customers with these applications, including 
schools, hospitals, water treatment plants, office buildings and data 
centers. 

``We see enormous potential for this segment of our business,'' said William 
F. Hecht, PPL chairman, president and chief executive officer. ``As an 
innovative energy company, with a strong record of anticipating and meeting 
customer needs, this agreement is a natural step for PPL.'' 

For the initial order of 1.25 megawatts, FuelCell Energy will provide PPL 
with DFCc power plant engineering and operations experience. FuelCell Energy 
will manufacture the DFCc plants for the program and provide interface 
requirements. PPL will provide comprehensive power plant operations and 
maintenance (O&M) management services for the field trial power plants 
procured and/or sold by PPL. 

Using carbonate technology, FuelCell Energy Direct FuelCell(TM) power plants 
have nominal ratings of 300 kW, 1.5 MW and 3 MW. The DFCc produces high 
efficiency energy through a chemical reaction, rather than through 
combustion, resulting in competitively priced electricity, with virtually no 
pollution. This revolutionary method of producing power gives energy users 
the option of producing electricity on site with the assurance of 
environmental compliance, less noise and with shorter timeframes required for 
the permitting process.

clean electricity at power stations or in distributed locations near the 
customer, including hospitals, schools, data centers and other commercial and 
industrial applications.

Being first is overrated.   IS IT TIME YET???

Allyson,

You should receive some formation documents relating to Edgecombe 
Development.  The name is not spelled correctly (missing an "e"), but that is 
being corrected at this time.  

 Bob spoke to me about wanting Enron to send a letter concerning the 
financing arrangements for the project.  I would like for us to discuss this 
as well.

Kay

This is a comparison to their version.  I think I have a comparison to ours 
as well.

I think you sent me an email which had some information from the gang about 
the tests, etc.  Do you still have it?

Thanks,

Would you please call Mitcha and get the relevant information?  I suppose 
that a demand letter (under the warranty?) could be in order but any 
pre-litigation moves need to be coordinated with Richard Sanders.  Maybe this 
hasn't risen to that level yet, but $12 Million sounds pretty serious.  

Hi Gregg,

I was out of the office on Friday, so I just now heard your voice mail.  I 
haven't been through all my email, but I haven't seen anything from Stephanie 
on email.  I do have a hard copy version which is too long to fax with 
confidence.  I'll give the forms a look, and fax them your way with some type 
of disclaimer for Peoples benefit.

Kay

   
	
	

Kay - Can I get these documents from you to forward to Peoples or are there 
other concerns?  

Thanks,

I've worked with Kilpatrick Stockton's North Carolina office quite a bit, 
mostly regulatory- they are so so.  It is my understanding that the Atlanta 
office messed up a simple thing for Lisa, and that's all I know about them.  
I've worked extensively with King & Spalding, both their Houston office 
(multiple matters) and Atlanta (two matters), and have had good results.  
I've always worked through John Keffer in Houston, who then hooked me up with 
the right folks in Atlanta.

are King & Spaulding and Kilpatrick & Stockton. I've worked with neither. Can 
you evaluate/recommend either?

We will have a great game this Sunday at 4:30 PM (the finals of the Texas

By the way, I picked up a Paper City just to read about you.  I feel like I

Hi John,

Question. Can we agree that a form contract will work for both EECC and 
NEPCO? Sure would make life easier.

Mike,

Here's a revised version of the option agreement.  I changed the shipping 
dates, quantity (10), Outside Exercise Date, and the amount of the option 
payment.  I did not change the prices, since I had not discussed this with 
Ben, and couldn't get the numbers to work.  

Have there been some changes to the data sheets?  It appears to me that there 
might be a version which reflects the inclusion of the low sound option.  In 
the last draft we did not include the low sound option because the impact on 
the load losses had not been agreed, so the prices did not reflect the option.

Please call or email me if you have any questions or comments.

Kay

Pretty small stuff from a dollar standpoint.  Perhaps the sky is not falling.

Ben,

Per our conversation, attached is the requested Punchlist.  The original, 
estimated value to correct all the discrepancies was approximately $250,000.  
After our discussions with SSEP on September 19, 2000, staffing levels and an 
increased productivity correcting the discrepancies took place.  Currently, 
we estimate that SSEP has about $35,000 left to correct and we expect them to 
finish by September 30, 2000.  Please note that the aforementioned 
description does not include the discrepancy we discovered concerning 
Enclosure Area Classification relating to gas migration.  We estimate that it 
will cost approximately $2,000 per unit ($48,000) to correct.  Our 
engineering is looking at this now and we plan to have an answer on this next 
week.

If there is any further assistance we can provide, please contact me at 
713-646-8258.

Gentlemen,

I've recently become involved in the "cell sale" side, meaning the 
transaction to sell the Fuel Cell equipment cells to CRRA.  I've met the Fuel 
Cell folks, but have not met anyone with CRRA yet.

Currently, I'm preparing a letter of intent for Enron/CRRA for the 
purchase/sale of the cells, have a development agreement prepared by outside 
counsel to review, and need to come up with a draft purchase agreement for 
FCE to review. I'll make sure Dan is in the loop on as much of that as he 
cares to read.

I've heard a rumor of an issue regarding the authority of CRRA to purchase 
the equipment (perhaps relating to the use of bond money for the purchase), 
but haven't come up to speed on that issue yet.  I would like to chase down 
that issue some more before a loud alarm is sounded, however.  

I'll get a grasp on the hearing protocol, as I know Dave is very interested 
in that aspect of the process.

Kay

With respect to the laundry list Dave D sent you:

1. Press Releases-the press release has not yet been prepared, but a first 
draft was worked up by FCEL's consel. Cle Dade and I are going to look at it 
with respect to what we think it should say, but have not yet done so.

2.Term Sheet -I will send you a draft of the most recent term sheet I am 
aware of by separate email..I believe they are in discussions with FCEL on 
that draft, but nothing has been signed.

3.Disclosure Discussions-I will also send you under separate email the 
initial draft of the "talking points" for the disclosure discusison. It is 
new and has not been discussed internally yet.

4.Contracts-Initial drafts of the documents for the purchase of the equity 
have been drafted and we await comments from FCEL's counsel.  Kay Mann is 
handling the "State" side of the deal and I request Kay by copy of this memo 
to advise you on what the status of any dealings with the state might be.

5.Regulatory Filings-There will be no filings required with respect to the 
purchase of the equity, unless we have to file a Sched. 13D, which will 
depend upon the timing of the option vesting.  My gut reaction is that we 
will probably need to file the 13D, but it is a routine filing.  I do not 
know what will be required in terms of hearings in the state process and 
again request Kay to please advise us on that.

It seems to me thay we should get a little farther along before we meet with 
the team on this, but I defer to your judgment.  Let me know what you want to 
do.

                                                                Dan

Guys, I have spoken to Cliff and Mark and we are comfortable moving forward 
under the structure we have discussed.

 FCEL: - $5MM in equity and 1.3MM warrants from corporate treasury stock that 
vest based upon 60MW of orders;
  - discussion with FCEL in which we disclose ALL infromation we have about 
the potential Conn. deal - I will require that myself and Mark be on   that 
call;
  - the transaction is fully press released immediately.

 CRRA: - subject to final due diligence on the development risks, we provide 
the management and wrap for CRRA on the potential fuel cell development   
opportunity that consists of between 25 and 50 MW;
  - any appropriation of funds from the government will require DPUC hearing 
at which we will fully disclose in a factual manner our interest in    FCEL.

I will require that Mark Haedicke manage this process and sign off on all 
press releases, term sheets, disclosure discussions, contracts and regulatory 
filings.  I believe that we have this managed appropriately as long as we 
manage the process as per the script and in a factual manner.

Thanks
Delainey

Per your request.

Kay

This is an internal draft, which has not been sent to CRRA, as far as I know.

Kay

Here's a first ckm draft based on what we had before.  From a substantive 
standpoint I used fuel cell energy technology as a generic, and not 
specifically relating it to FCE.  I based this on a very brief discussion I 
had with Heather, so I hope I didn't misunderstand.

I've incorporated the confidentiality agreement by reference, and included a 
brief statement that this transaction falls within its purview.  

Please let me know your comments.

Karen,

Could we have the option of using a letter of credit versus a corporate 
guaranty? (8)

Following are the proposed conditions to special use which we will be
submitting to the County for their review and attachment to the final zoning
approvals.  Please review and discuss any comments with me or Mark Gershon.

PROPOSED CONDITIONS TO SPECIAL USE
FOR
LIVINGSTON ENERGY CENTER (the "Facility")
TITAN LAND DEVELOPMENT CO., L.L.C. ("Titan")
SOUTHEAST INTERSECTION OF 1400 N. AND 1700 E. ROADS (the "Property")

1.   The operation of the Facility shall satisfy all Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency noise pollution requirements.

2.   Titan shall enter into a roadway agreement with the County and
Township Highway Commissioners which assigns responsibility for repair of,
maintenance of, and debris removal on Township and County roadways during
construction of the Facility.

3.   Contingent upon all property owners' written approval being secured,
Titan shall have installed at most four monitoring wells on at most four
properties within one and one-half miles surrounding the Property.  One
monitoring well each shall be installed on a property to the north, south,
east, and west.  Titan shall monitor well levels on each of the properties
on a quarterly basis and shall make such monitoring information available to
the County Engineer at his request for five years following issuance of the
final Certificate of Occupancy.  If no adverse impact due to the operation
of the Facility is found during the first five year monitoring period, then
Titan shall monitor well levels for each of the properties two (2) times per
year and shall make such monitoring information available to the County
Engineer upon his request for the life of the Facility.

4.   The maximum number of power generating units shall be limited to a
maximum of ten (10).

5.   Titan shall have repaired or replaced any drainage tile broken on
the Property during construction and operation of the Facility that would
adversely impact any surrounding property owner.

6.   The site plan for the Facility shall allow no greater than forty
percent (40%) of the site's total acreage to be developed with
non-landscaped areas, open space, or agricultural uses

7.   Upon permanent cessation of use of the Facility as an electric
generation facility, Titan shall remove all above ground buildings,
equipment, footings, appurtenances and structures, including accessory
buildings and equipment. 

8.   Titan shall make those stormwater improvements identified on the
attached Stormwater Management Plan.  Additionally, a) upon adoption by
Pontiac Township and Eppards Point Township of the Area-wide Stormwater
Management study prepared by Farnsworth & Wylie (the "Study") for the
Property and the surrounding area and b) upon written agreement to proceed
with the stormwater management improvements identified in the Study by those
property owners whose properties are identified by the Study as requiring
stormwater management improvements, Titan shall commit to make those
stormwater management improvements identified in the Study for the Property.
Titan shall provide a corporate guaranty to the County in the amount of
fifty-five thousand dollars ($55,000) with a C.P.I. as security for making
those stormwater management improvements identified in the Study for the
Property.  Titan shall construct such improvements contemporaneously with
other such improvements being completed in the Study area. 

9.   Construction of each phase of the Facility from initiation to
completion is estimated to require from six (6) to twelve (12) months
subject to weather constraints, acts of God, materials availability, strikes
and other labor issues, changes in regulations affecting development and
construction, and other constraints not within the control of Titan.  Within
twelve months following issuance of the final Certificate of Occupancy all
improvements shall be completed and all construction equipment and trailers
shall be removed.

Hi Rusty,

Just wanted to check to see if  you can get me a copy.

Thanks,

Matt, Since so much of this related to tax, I thought you should have a look 
at it.

Rusty/Fred, I'm not sure of the context of the presentation of the 
information.  Is this something which is going to the public, or to the 
governmental entity involved?  If there is something which will be 
distributed to the public, then we should consider having Enron's PR group 
bless it.  

Kay
 As many of you know, we have received a number of written questions
from Livingston County which were presented to them by residents.  Enron and
our firm have  prepared and  attached an initial draft response to those
questions.  Copies are provided in Word Perfect and Word for your
convenience.  Certain of the responses deal with specific areas for which
each of you are responsible.  While we have attempted to utilize the
information that you have previously prepared, it is critical that you
approve the responses.  Please review the proposed responses and fax me any
changes or call me by noon tomorrow.  While I'm quite interested in any
comments you may have on any of the responses, please be prepare to
specifically approve or modify the following questions:

 1. Pollina - Questions 1 - 7;

 2. Farnsworth & Wylie - Questions A and B;

 3. ENSR - Questions 8, 9, A and B; and

 4. Everyone else - Everything.

 I hope to speak to each of you, but if you cannot reach me please
call Karen Way at 312-368-2152.

Hmm.

Ben, given that they want to use the existing LM6000 contract for the GSU 
change order, I wanted to know if you were okay with this interaction with 
GE.  Also, by using the existing LM6000 contract, they will be using up 
capacity available for other LM6000 related equipment.  Are you okay with 
this, i.e., you believe there is capacity available for them, and any 
suggestions on how you would like to see them pay for the usage since the 
LM600s have already paid the upfront structuring fee and ongoing commitment 
fees.

I wanted to contact you to let you know that we (ENA West) are attemtping to 
help the ENA San Francisco guys locate a Generator Step Up Transformer for 
the Pleasanton project.  ENA is responsible to bring an LM6000 and GSU to the 
project.  We cannot use one of the ABB transformers (Don Hammond checked with 
ABB, and the as built configuration simply cannot be used or changed to meet 
the needs of ENA SFO's application.  As such, we have had to go out and find 
a GSU.  The good news is we have found one through GE.  It will meet SFO's 
delivery schedule.  We have not received a quote, nor have we signed anything 
(but we want to ASAP).  In talking to Dale Rasmussen, I understand we would 
need to purchase this major component through a West LB structure.  GE 
prefers to sell us the GSU through ENA's existing contract with GE.  As such, 
I am asking what steps you (or Kay) would like us to take in setting up a 
purchase option (or whatever is the correct noun name for reserving, buying a 
needed GSU in a timely manner).

This e mail is meant to be a starting point in dialog.  Please contact me on 
Tuesday to discuss whatever is necessary.

Thanks.

I don't have a problem with this to the extent Chris Calger has approved the 
expenditure which I would guess would be approximately $500k. If these guys 
are simply trying to execute a purchase option while they try to firm up 
their deal, they should probably do it as a stand alone agreement (since we 
don't need to involve WestLB in purchase options).

In any case, the key point here is Chris' approval of what is probably around 
a $500k expenditure (of course, the option should only be for around 10% of 
this amount). We don't need to worry about WestLB fees, etc., since this is 
an ENA (West) Originations prospective deal.

Hi Dan,

One more thing I want to mention.  As you know, Enron has a confidentiality 
agreement with a competitor of Fuel Cell (I believe it is ONSI).  The 
agreement has an exclusivity arrangement, which prevents the other company 
from chasing certain transactions without Enron.  Once we really know what we 
are going to do with FCE, will it be necessary/advisable to waive the 
exclusivity provision to avoid any restraint of trade arguments?  

FYI, When I last discussed the other company with Ozzie and Heather on 
Friday, they were planning on calling the other company to tell them the 
general status without violating confidentiality obligations to FCE or CRRA.  
I will follow up to get the details of the discussion.

Kay

You made me laugh.

It doesn't get any easier.

How about meeting in Sheila's office (3879) at 1030?

Hi Stephanie,

Thanks for the hard copy of the ISDA docs.  Would it be possible to get an 
electronic version of what you gave me?

Thanks again,

Kay

Mark/Karen,

I received your voice mail regarding my comment about substituting the LOC.  
The reason for this suggestion is to provide flexibility in our financing 
structures, depending on which entities own equity in the LLC at the time of 
the posting of the security.  Perhaps language such as  "an appropriate 
payment security" or other similar language can be utilized. Please be 
assured that I have an understanding of the differences between an LOC and a 
corporate guaranty.

The draft responses have been forwarded to the Enron tax department, due to 
the discussions concerning certain tax issues.  I believe it is appropriate 
to get their approval of the language prior to these answers being released.

Also, I don't believe I fully appreciate the context of these questions and 
answers, and how and to whom these answers will be given. A brief explanation 
would be most appreciated.

Thank you,

Kay

Here's the latest info I have.

Reagan Rorschach

I spoke with Wayne Duman last Thursday (9/21/00) to schedule a Enron VEPCO 
meeting for September 29, 2000 to discuss VEPCO progress with the Facility 
Study and processing/negotiating the Interconnect Agreement.  Wayne cancelled 
that meeting later that same afternoon.  I spoke with him today in regarding 
the reasons for cancellation.  

As it turns out, his group--Bulk Power Delivery--is not the group executing 
the PPA with Enron.  That group is Tim Talmadge's group--Capacity 
Acquisition.  Once Wayne tried to schedule the 9/29 meeting, he was told not 
to talk with Enron.  Further investigation on his part uncovered some 
internal VEPCO issues.  He is calling an internal meeting with Capacity 
Acquisition, Bulk Power Delivery, Bulk Power Operations and the Transmission 
Group to discuss these issues and establish a consistent "game plan" for 
going forward.

The Transmission Group is scheduled to finish the Facility Study on Monday, 
October 2, 2000.  The study will include switchyard needs, network needs, 
construction costs, and construction schedule.  He knows we have a June 2001 
commercial operation date, and he knows that Capacity Acquisition is 
responsible for the associated construction costs.  He is nervous that the 
Facility Study will forecast construction schedules that do not coincide with 
the commercial operation date.  He further indicated that acquisition of 
necessary equipment--breakers, transformers, etc. specified by the Facility 
Study--could be a significant challenge for VEPCO.  He understands that this 
is his challenge, not ours.  He also noted that VEPCO is very sensitive and 
careful to operate within FERC guidelines regarding interconnection and the 
various time frames--this includes not making any special considerations to 
the Capacity Acquisition guys since they are in the same company.

Wayne Duman is very involved in VEPCO's effort to develop an Interconnection 
Agreement consistent with FERC.  They are within days of completing this 
task--it is in legal review right now.  The current  version of the 
Interconnection Agreement is a subsequent generation of the document we 
reviewed at the beginning of August.  Wayne understands that the PPA which 
VEPCO and Enron are negotiating is contardictory to the "boiler plate" 
Interconnection Agreement and needs to be changed to reflect the PPA defined 
scopes for Enron and VEPCO.  He indicated that part of VEPCO's "to do list" 
to get ready to meet with Enron includes modification of the latest 
generation of the VEPCO Interconnection Agreement to be consistent with the 
Enron PPA.

He is optimistic that we would be able to meet late next week to get the 
Interconnect Agreement process underway.  He assured me that he would keep 
Enron informed of the progress.

In summary, VEPCO is doing the following:
getting all stakeholders on the same page,
finishing the Facility Study, and
getting their Interconnection Agreement to agree with the PPA.

Other than that Mrs. Lincoln...

Brian,

I'm not sure I understand their objection to the wording about the guaranty.  
Do you think that there is going to be a problem with them accepting the 
Mitsui guaranty? I don't know what the arrangements are with Mitsui, and 
perhaps there isn't a real issue due to how this is being handled in the EPC 
contracts.  

My understanding is that Peggy will be giving legal sign off on these 
agreements for ENA.

Kay, I intend to print out the final agreements and take them over to your 
office for execution today if you are ready.  Please advise.

As the Consolidation Agreement was thought by GE to be finalized, and all of 
the contract documents to be executed last Friday (which did not happen), I 
am not surprised at the following responses Jeff Smith gave me today to the 
suggested changes.

The edit on page 4 to the last "Whereas" is acceptable;

The edits to Clauses 2(a) and 2(b) are not accepted.  GE does not have any 
defenses under either contract for insolvency, bankruptcy or similar 
circumstances because they are events of breach of contract and subject to 
the remedy of termination if not cured after notice.  Pursuant to Clause 5, 
if one contract is subject to termination, then the other is also.  However, 
we have the ability to partially terminate if we see fit.  (Example:  Under 
the Onshore Contract, GEOIC's TD of I personnel do not show up, we can 
terminate only the TD of I scope and self perform.  The equipment, its 
warranties and guarantees are still in place).  GE sees the added language as 
unnecessary.

The suggested lined out changes to Clause 6 is not acceptable to GE.  GE 
requires that the tie back to the notices provisions of the Contracts 
remain.  The other edits to this Clause are acceptable.

The suggested change to Clause 15 is not acceptable.  GE states that they 
wish to remain simplistic and firm in this document, and that it should not 
reflect Enron's buisness arrangements such as the subsequent assignment to 
Mitsui.  GE wants to be sure the assignment language is not skirted.   If the 
ENA parent guarantee has not been provided by the time the Contracts are 
assigned to Mitsui, the Assignment provisions of the Contracts allow for the 
replacement of the ENA obligation by other equivalent guarantees or 
assurances.  Additionally, the ENA parent guarantee (a guarantee 
substantially less than one provided by Enron Crop) was originally to be 
provided as a condition precedent to execution of the Contracts, but we 
talked them into a due date of 30 days later.  This request looks like 
retrading the deal to GE and they do not want to lose the little comfort they 
have now. 

Attached is a redline showing a few proposed modifications to the GE 
consolidation agreement.

Please feel free to call me at (713) 221-1524 with any questions.

I spoke with Wayne Duman last Thursday (9/21/00) to schedule a Enron VEPCO 
meeting for September 29, 2000 to discuss VEPCO progress with the Facility 
Study and processing/negotiating the Interconnect Agreement.  Wayne cancelled 
that meeting later that same afternoon.  I spoke with him today in regarding 
the reasons for cancellation.  

As it turns out, his group--Bulk Power Delivery--is not the group executing 
the PPA with Enron.  That group is Tim Talmadge's group--Capacity 
Acquisition.  Once Wayne tried to schedule the 9/29 meeting, he was told not 
to talk with Enron.  Further investigation on his part uncovered some 
internal VEPCO issues.  He is calling an internal meeting with Capacity 
Acquisition, Bulk Power Delivery, Bulk Power Operations and the Transmission 
Group to discuss these issues and establish a consistent "game plan" for 
going forward.

The Transmission Group is scheduled to finish the Facility Study on Monday, 
October 2, 2000.  The study will include switchyard needs, network needs, 
construction costs, and construction schedule.  He knows we have a June 2001 
commercial operation date, and he knows that Capacity Acquisition is 
responsible for the associated construction costs.  He is nervous that the 
Facility Study will forecast construction schedules that do not coincide with 
the commercial operation date.  He further indicated that acquisition of 
necessary equipment--breakers, transformers, etc. specified by the Facility 
Study--could be a significant challenge for VEPCO.  He understands that this 
is his challenge, not ours.  He also noted that VEPCO is very sensitive and 
careful to operate within FERC guidelines regarding interconnection and the 
various time frames--this includes not making any special considerations to 
the Capacity Acquisition guys since they are in the same company.

Other than that Mrs. Lincoln...

Has anyone given any thought to the creation of a new company to enter into 
the CRRA/Fuel Cell purchase/sale transactions?  Any names to suggest?  If 
Enron is going to be the contractor as contemplated by the PDA, I would 
expect to use a limited liablity company and not ENA.  

Please advise.

Kay

I can call you when I get out of my meeting, but it might be awhile.  Or, it 
might be 600.  Dunno.

I just left a vm for Carrie explaining what I would like to do. I will leave
you a vm as to the outcome. Sushi sounds good to me. NM

Sounds fine to me.  I would suggest new sushi place if I knew when we would
be getting out.

I haven't heard from Carrie Burton.  I'm on the phone.  If you would like
to call her, St. Francis number is 713 782 0481.

Kay

Please respond to <nmann@erac.com>

Just let me know before 5 and I will pick it up.
My day? I feel like I lost control of Loss Control about 9am. Is it a full
moon?
Think you will feel like steak after your meeting with the big guys or
would
you prefer something else?

Carrie Burton (works for Sallie Ellis) left a message that it would be a
good idea for us to pick up a packet today.  I was hoping that it would be
ready so I could pick it up a lunch, but it wasn't.  If I hear from her I
will ask how late someone can pick it up, or maybe they can leave it at the
Children's Center since they don't close until 600.

How is your day?

I have a 500 meeting with the big boys.

Love,

Kay

Que lastima. 

FYI.  I'll bring you the ONSI confidentiality agreement.

Hi Dan,

One more thing I want to mention.  As you know, Enron has a confidentiality 
agreement with a competitor of Fuel Cell (I believe it is ONSI).  The 
agreement has an exclusivity arrangement, which prevents the other company 
from chasing certain transactions without Enron.  Once we really know what we 
are going to do with FCE, will it be necessary/advisable to waive the 
exclusivity provision to avoid any restraint of trade arguments?  

FYI, When I last discussed the other company with Ozzie and Heather on 
Friday, they were planning on calling the other company to tell them the 
general status without violating confidentiality obligations to FCE or CRRA.  
I will follow up to get the details of the discussion.

Kay

Got anything that looks like a confidentiality agreement with a company 
called ONSI?  Should have been signed this spring.

Thanks.

Kay

Hi Sarah,

Thank you so much for your efforts to get this scheduled.  However, it 
doesn't look today is going to work.  

Since spoke earlier this week, Michael has been accepted to private school, 
where we believe we will move him.  However, we still haven't determined what 
to do about speech therapy, and would appreciate the benefit of your 
evaluation and expertise, especially since Michael is eligible to receive 
services at VO.  Is it possible to schedule a meeting with that in mind?

Thanks again,

Kay

Hi Mrs. Mann, 
I thought this might be an easier way to communicate in scheduling the ARD
to review Michael's testing.  Please let me know if tomorrow (9-27) at 11:45
will work for you.  I need to offer you at least a five days written notice
of the ARD so if tomorrow will work for you, would you be willing to waive
the  5 days prior notice.  If not, we can schedule the meeting next week.
Thank you.

FYI, and for us to discuss.

Kay,

I will be preparing the loan documents for the joint venture with Peoples.  I 
understand that the loans will be unsecured but cross guarantied (i.e., Enron 
will guaranty the People's loans and vice versa), but I have several 
additional, basic questions re:  the terms of the Enron loan and the 
intercreditor arrangements with Peoples. 

In terms of beginning drafting the loan documents, answers to questions 6(a) 
and 8 would be extremely helpful in selecting an appropriate form.

1.  People's loan agreement -- will it be an exact clone of ours?

2.  Guaranties -- will the cross-guaranties guaranty payment to the other 
venturer of all unpaid amounts under such venturer's loan agreement, or will 
they instead function more as an intercreditor/sharing agreement (i.e., if 
one venturer receives a payment that the other does not, the paid venturer 
will share its payment ratably with the unpaid venturer)?

3.  Intercreditor Issues/Exercise of remedies -- Please confirm that there is 
to be no 100% lender vote requirement for acceleration, etc., and that each 
venturer can pursue remedies with respect to its loan independently (although 
I presume the facilities will be cross defaulted). 

4.  Advancing mechanics -- besides requiring ratable advances with the 
People's facility, will there be any conditions precedent to advances other 
than the typical no default/representations true & correct/no MAC?

5.  Repayment -- will there be any commitment step-downs/mandatory 
prepayments?

6.  Interest -- what will the (a) interest rate basis and (b) margin be?

7.  Fees -- Will there be any sort of upfront fee?  What will the commitment 
fee be? (And what will the amount of Enron's commitment be?)

8.  Lender(s) -- Does Enron intend to keep its revolver as a single lender 
facility, or should we provide for a syndicated arrangement?

9.  Other information -- When will specific financial covenant information be 
available? 

Please call me at 713.221.1419 regarding the foregoing.  I look forward to 
working with you on this transaction.  

Thanks!

Heather

In connection with the attached, please note the highlighted language at the

Karen,

It appears to me that this version of the document allocates a new risk to 
Enron:  risk of damage to a certain road during construction.  It would seem 
that the responsibility to repair it should be limited to damage done as a 
result of the construction.  Also, it is unclear as written as to whether we 
can repair it ourselves, or whether the City fixes it and sends us the bill.  
What is the intent?

Thank you,

Kay

Here are my observations:

I'm not certain that an Enron entity will provide a performance guaranty.  I 
agree that the commercial deal is that a portion of the fee will be at risk 
for a performance problem.

Is the reference to the "State" a reference to the DPUC or CRRA?

As far as I know, the CRRA deal is still in the works, with nothing but a 
confidentiality agreement (with an exclusivity provision) signed, and in my 
opinion should not be presented as being a done deal.

Here's a marked version of suggested changes.

Would it be preferable to be consistent with the use of the names VEPCO and 
Capacity and Energy Agreement?

Kay

Good afternoon,

Our son Michael will be in your class beginning next Monday, October 2, so I 
wanted to introduce myself.  I hope we will get to meet in person soon. 

Is there anything you would like to suggest that we do to make the transition 
easier?

I picked up the package of information today, and will read it tonight. l 
won't ask any questions until I do my homework.

I look forward to seeing you soon!

Kay 

1.  I haven't seen the paperwork on the name change.  I asked around 
yesterday, and I have someone checking it out.  Initially going through Corp 
(vs. ENA) made it a bit more complicated to track down.

2.  I believe I sent you a form services agreement to review.  I think that 
the parameters for performing certain services can be captured by way of 
reference to a named guideline or procedure, or by attachment as an exhibit.  
I will resend the email for your easy reference.

Hope this helps.

That's it for this moment.

Hi Heather,

Peggy,

Here are my observations on the Vitro turbine purchase agreement, for you t=
o=20
consider, pass along, ignore, modify, etc.  I=01,m ignoring some issues, an=
d=20
considering where the transaction is at this point, you may want to overloo=
k=20
more.

The project company should be the signatory to all three contracts.  Brian =
is=20
changing this.  Purchaser and Owner will then be the same entity, so some=
=20
changes within the document will be necessary.  By the way, is everything=

being shipped via rail or land?  If there is any marine transport which mig=
ht=20
necessitate EEIM chartering a vessel, the organization docs may need to be=

check to make sure that is covered (ran into this problem on another projec=
t).

Comments to offshore contract:

Commercial operation is a key term, yet isn=01,t defined. (an example of us=
e is=20
14.1.1)

5.3 This should be integrated with the change order procedure in Article XI=
.=20
As I recall the same is true for both cost and schedule extensions.

10.3.2 GE isn=01,t subject to delay ld=01,s unless Purchaser is subject to =
similar=20
delay ld=01,s with Owner.  This will need to be changed since Owner will be=
=20
Purchaser, but I don=01,t like this concept. Maybe it is covered by the EPC=
 wrap.

The term Takeover Performance criteria is used in 10.9.7, with a reference=
=20
back to 10.3.2; it is probably reasonable to construe the first few criteri=
a=20
as being Takeover Performance criteria, but better practice would have it=
=20
defined.

10.14 A =01&provided that=018 should be added after (a).  This change shoul=
d=20
probably be made as a clarification.
=20
14.3 Five days for GE to provide a service representative for a warranty=20
problem is fairly generous since the Owner can=01,t work on the equipment i=
n the=20
meanwhile.  I don=01,t know what the EPC contract says on the point, so the=
re=20
may be some protection. Probably too late and too commercial.

14.6 The first and second sentence of this paragraph are not consistent.  T=
he=20
second sentence is the better one.

Note that a strike against GE is a force majeure event for which GE can get=
=20
schedule and cost relief. Too late for this deal, though.

21.3 the confidentiality provisions have no time limit.

I didn=01,t notice a FCPA provision, but I might have overlooked it.

I assume the onshore contract has some of the same issues. =20

As for the onshore/offshore split, it would seem that some coordination wit=
h=20
the onshore/offshore epc contract would be in order, especially if the tax=
=20
risk is ours.  My initial impression of the proposed split on the turbine=
=20
contract is that the onshore contract still contains too much relating to t=
he=20
offshore scope. =20

Brian is working on the consolidation agreement.

Steve is working on the payment issue.

By the way, I'll be on vacation tomorrow and next week. =20

Hello - In order to cross one more item off of the enovate setup list, I 
would like to pursue the initial capital contribution required under the LLC 
agreement of $100,000 from each member.  Although we do not have loan 
facilities in place or final cash management protocol, I believe the initial 
funding can still take place.  If anyone has any other thoughts please let me 
know.  If not, I would like to schedule the initial funding for Friday, 
October 6th.  I believe that Mary Lynne will prepare the necessary vouchers 
and journal entries.  I am assuming that Enron MW, L.L.C., as Member, will be 
funding enovate, L.L.C.  Does ENA then fund Enron MW, L.L.C.? (Kay? Mary 
Lynne?)  

As an update - Peoples' Board meets next Wednesday, Oct. 4th to approve the 
risk management policy.  Assuming approval, enovate will be free to transact 
with third parties.  Therefore, depending on payment terms, money will begin 
flowing through the enovate account.  Therefore, any loan docs and service 
agreements should be in place by the second week of October.

Any thoughts, please let me know.

Thanks,

Gregg

No response required - fyi.

Heather,

This is a rough cut of a services agreement.  Since the loan agreement, 
services agreement and LLC agreement are all pieces of the same puzzle, I 
thought I would send it your way.

Kay

This is a very rough draft based on an agreement done previously with a jv 
company.  I'm sending it for Enron review only, since I haven't even read the 
entire thing yet.  I thought you might want to take a look at it to see what 
you think, and to consider the scope of the services to be provided.

As for legal services, one alternative would be to have the services provided 
by an outside law firm, not associated with either principal.

Could you forward me what you received from Clement regarding the corporate 
guaranty issue?  I would like to see what's the latest in that regard.

Thanks,

I spoke with Karen Way this afternoon.  She received a call earlier today 
from Mr. Ledford's (Pontiac site neighbour) attorney.  The attorney called to 
say that he had met with the Ledford family this morning to review our 
proposed Option Purchase Agreement on the Ledford property (home and land 
adjacent to our Pontiac project site).  The result of this meeting was that 
we "have a deal" subject to the following changes:

 1.  That the son and daughter-in-law be made parties to the Agreement (they 
currently own/reside in the home and have indicated they are ready to sign)
 2.  That Titan LLC will pay the survey, title search and transfer fees as a 
part of the closing costs of the property (approx $3-$5K)

The Ledford family understands that we wish to execute this Agreement prior 
to conducting our zoning meetings next Monday and Thursday evening.  

Since these changes are relatively minor , I have instructed Karen to revise 
the necessary pages of the Agreement and forward copies to the Ledford's 
attorney for review (and hopefully execution).  Please call/email myself and 
Karen with any comments.

Thanks,
Fred

Thanks for the information.  If I deciphered this correctly, this is going to 
be what I would call an "autoborrow" facility ... Enovate's cash flow is 
swept into an account.  Each day:  (i) if Enovate's cash position is short 
(and availability remains under the loan agreements) advances are made under 
each loan agreement (probably directly into the acount), and (ii) if 
Enovate's position is long, the positive balance of the account is applied 
towards the outstanding loan balances, if any.  We'll need to get minimum 
target amounts (i.e., do you really want them paying down $1.00 of each 
loan?) from the business people.

Based on the foregoing, I suspect that these will be single-lender, prime 
rate based loan agreements (otherwise it would be a huge operational 
headache).  Once you confirm the single lender part, that will be enough 
preliminary information for me to start on a loan agreement.

Hi Heather,

Don't have the answers to your questions, but I wanted you to see the
attachment to Gregg's email.  It outlines some of the commercial aspects of
the loan agreement, although it might not be in a form you can easily
decipher.

1.  I haven't seen the paperwork on the name change.  I asked around
yesterday, and I have someone checking it out.  Initially going through
Corp (vs. ENA) made it a bit more complicated to track down.

2.  I believe I sent you a form services agreement to review.  I think that
the parameters for performing certain services can be captured by way of
reference to a named guideline or procedure, or by attachment as an
exhibit.  I will resend the email for your easy reference.

Hope this helps.

Everyone,

When first we did the Demar deal, we received from Intership, the owner of 
the barge, a letter allowing us to take Demar's position in the contract to 
complete the purchase of the vessel should Demar fail to complete the 
purchase.  The reason for this is that Demar was providing its interest in 
the barge purchase contract as  collateral to the line of credit of $20MM.

What Gregorio Relloso is referring to in his letter is that we could now have 
a lien on the vessel to collateralize the line of credit.

I believe the savings to Demar in accelerating the payment is $700,000.  
Since Demar will no longer be making payments on the barge it's cash
flow should improve in September, October and November at which time I 
understand the work on EPC-4 should be complete.

For what it is worth I think we ought to approve this transaction providing, 
a) there is room in the credit line and none of our conditions are affected 
and b) Demar's projected cash flow to job completion is not negatively 
impacted.

I working with outside counsel to get a draft of the revolver prepared.  She

With a typical contractor a tight schedule usually increases the cost. You 
might check to see how much a delay in COD to, say Aug 1,  might lower the 
cost of construction.  Not to say that it will, but it might.

BUSY, as usual.

modification to the third "whereas" in the Ledford-Titan Option incorporated
this morning following my conversations with Fred and Rusty.  
   WHEREAS, Optionors desire to grant to Optionee, and Optionee desires
to obtain from Optionors, an option for the grant of an easement in, over
and within the strip of land 100' wide in Parcel 2 (defined below) which is
immediately adjacent to and east of the railroad right-of-way for the
installation of drain tiles, pipelines, and other utility uses across other
property owned by Optionors ("Parcel 2"), as more particularly described in
Exhibit B attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference (the
"Easement"); 

Additionally, I have received a fax copy of the executed Fehr agreement. I
am stopping by their attorney's office today to pick up the originals and to
put together the joint counterpart signatures.  I am also meeting with the
Ledford's attorney this afternoon and hope to finalize the execution of that
Option as well.  I will fax you the fully executed copies tomorrow morning
when I return to the office and the original versions will follow by fed ex.
Please call either Mark Gershon or me on Mark's cell phone 847-869-2015 with
any questions or comments. Thank you.

Attached is Change Order #2 for your review. It would probably be a good idea 
if you executed it rather than Janet since it pertains to one of your 
projects. If you have any issues / changes / questions, let me know. Also let 
me know if you need any assistance regarding the DASH for this change order.

Regards,

Ben

FYI.  When do you think you'll be done?

Thanks,

computer
and my cell phone with me.  If you need me please contact me via e-mail or 
cell
phone.

Thanks,

I suggest the changes as shown on the attached.  

Chris is researching a drawing number so that we have them committed to a 
certain specification.

I've added the concept of a date certain for the delivery.  I'm referring to 
these as "Equipment" and part of the "Units" so it is clear that the 
warranties apply.

Is there any change to the sound guaranty level (or other guarantees) for the 
units utilizing these stacks?

Kay

Kay:

Attached is Change Order #2 which has the changes Chris Booth made and a few 
minor type type changes I made.  I don't know Chris Calger or his title, so 
if you would like me to obtain his signature, please advise.

Hi there.

I made changes in accordance with our meeting on Friday.  Please let me know 
what other changes you would like to see.

Thanks,

Kay

FYI
	
	

Attached is a markup of the previous DASH to reflect the latest proposed 
funding of enovate.  Daily, ENA and Peoples will each fund 50% of the cash 
requirements of enovate through their respective intercompany loans.  Rather 
than reduce the revolver to $25 million, I have left it alone at $50 million 
to accomodate expected growth and potential transactions.  In this regard, I 
have also attached a spreadsheet which shows the potential cash needs of 
enovate based on some very loose assumptions.  Let me know if you think the 
edits are sufficient. 

I think that Sarah Wesner is on vacation, so if we need input from Global 
Finance let me know and I will route it through other channels.  The initial 
capital contribution of $100,000 is scheduled for this Friday, October 6.  
Loan documentation and a services agreement is being drafted by legal.  The 
first payment out of enovate is scheduled for October 25, so that is our 
target date for completion.

Any questions or comments, please let me know.

Thanks,

Gregg

I thought someone from Trading should give this a look.

Thanks,

Kay
	
	

As you are all aware, Peoples' Board meets this Wednesday to approve the risk 
management policy.  Peoples met Friday with the Chair of their Audit 
Committee to review the policy.  Feedback has been positive.  The main 
concern is that proper reporting and controls are in place to monitor enovate 
and protect Peoples' interests.  They would like to forward the risk policy, 
as complete as possible, to Arthur Andersen for their review prior to the 
Board meeting.  Attached is the latest draft.  In order to expedite the 
review, I am forwarding it on without looking at Peoples' additional 
comments, in blue, in detail.  I would like to have any comments ASAP, but no 
later than first thing tomorrow morning.  If this doesn't work, please let me 
know.

Kay - they have changed some of David's language and I need your input from a 
legal/technical point of view as to the substance of their changes.

Vlady - any and all thoughts are greatly appreciated.

Richard and Laura - same goes for you, but I want to make sure you are 
comfortable with the rules of the game going forward.

Thanks,

Gregg

Please forward your October events (other than the conference) to me as soon

Thank you!

I'm trying to pick a favorite.  

Here is the ABB contract you referenced in your email.

I am working on a 97-10 compliant EPC contract for NEPCO/EECC.  However, I 
wonder about the challenges presented with the need for NEPCO to enter into 
subcontracts and purchase orders which preserve the accounting treatment all 
the way down the line. This is a very tall order given the contracting 
environment.

Your email is an excellent description of the challenges of doing a deal off 
the balance sheet, and worthy of further discussion.

Kay

Hi Paul,

This will need the same facilities agreement treatment as the GE contract we 
are working on.

Thanks,

Kay
Kay:

Attached is the final version:

I'm just afraid to say anything about anything because of what you said the 
other night about, gee you can't do anything right.  I guess I'm a little 
upset because you comment on how I do things (I don't even try to fold 
clothes, pack the car, unpack the groceries, load the dishwasher, etc.) but 
if I say something about how you do something, you get upset and say you 
can't do anything right (so I should feel guilty about saying anything about 
anything).

Gotta go.  We can talk about it later if you want.

Love,

Kay

Here's the latest revision inserting the drawing numbers.  Is it ready to go 
to GE?

Scott, payment for change orders is addressed in the contract.  

We seem to missing the termination agreement.  I'll check with Brian.

Sara, I am forwarding this to you because as you will notice your last name 
has been misspelled.  I have been speaking with Peoples recently about the 
potential sale of some financial options via Enovate.  This has brought up to 
issue of the ISDA agreement.  I don't know if you are the one working on this 
specific ISDA, but I got your name off a document showing you as the person 
working in general on ISDA agreements between Enovate and third parties.

I will call shortly to insure you receive this, and one more to follow, and 
that you are the appropriate person.  If you need to reach me, my extension 
is 36900.

I would think cocktail attire.  What time are the receptions?

This seminar that Ric is going to in Las Vegas is having cocktail receptions 
each evening and special shows by Dana Carvey and Penn and Teller.  There's 
no dress specified, so I'm assuming something nice but not overdone.  What 
would you think?  

Just a small piece of internal discussions regarding the revolving line of 
credit and how it ties in with the enovate bank account.
Sarah Wesner
10/03/2000 09:31 AM
 Enovate's bank account is already set up under the Enron global agreement 
with Citibank. 

The facility will be lent by ENE and People's.  If People's does not fund its 
half of enovate obligatiosns and an overdraft of the enovate Citibank account 
occurs, ENE would eventually be liable for the overdraft amount to Citi 
(Sam-please confirm.)  If Enron would be liable under its gloabal account 
agreement then Enron needs an indemnification/guarantee from People's in the 
event that People's does not fund its half.

Roxanne,

Thank you for calling last night. We took Michael out for dinner to celebrate 
his first day at SF, and missed your call. Michael had a great first day.  
All the kids drew portraits of him, and he got a big kick out of it.

I noticed on the class list that you live in Spring Valley.  We live on 
Inverness Park Way, and used to live on Cedarspur a few years back.  It is 
nice to know that Michael has a classmate in the neighborhood.

Again, thanks for calling.

Kay

Tough time of day to dress for, but I think  you have it figured out.

6:00 p.m.-7pm with dinner at 7pm.

I don't have a lot of formal stuff that fits me now - I've gained weight in 
the past 18 months.  I may do a little shopping.

The last conference Ric went to in Vegas he didn't really bring dress 
clothes.  We'll see.  They would have said black tie if it was a formal 
affair (like your trip with Neil).  What are you going to wear?  Do you have 
lots of formal attire?

Hi Scott,

Here's a revised draft for your review and comment.  I've taken out the 
balance of plant warranty because you raised a valid point about them knowing 
what BOP entails.  So now it is just a warranty. I've also been more explicit 
about our fee.

I think there's a bit of confusion embedded in the document because of the 
uncertainty about who is doing what, but I haven't come up with a simple fix 
yet.

Sorry, didn't mean to forget you.

Here's the latest revision inserting the drawing numbers.  Is it ready to go 
to GE?

Scott, payment for change orders is addressed in the contract.  

That's a good one.

I knew you guys would hit a home run!

I have a conference call at 330, then I'll come see you.

Kay,

As I am sure you have heard, the hearing went famously.  Allyson and company 
did a fantastic job preparing.  Witness Keenan performed as expected.  
Neither intervener (NCNG nor the Attorney General's Office) had any 
questions.  Giselle Rankin asked if we would commit to establishing site 
control via a lease, or similiar, prior to transferring the option.  Witness 
Keenan answered in the affirmative.  She had no further questions.  The 
commissioners had two questions--1) where will you connect to VEPCO's system? 
 2) Is this a real deal?  Everyone is behind the project and getting excited 
as the external hurdles steadily disappear.

All in all, things could not have gone much better.  It was agreed at the 
hearing that Allyson and Giselle would file the order jointly on October 11.  
Allyson will prepare a draft of the order and deliver to us Friday.  She, 
Giselle and Tom Chapman are working on the "for any reason" language.  They 
had not discussed the language you submitted last week.  Your language is 
where they will start.  

Allyson feels that we have such strong support from the Commissioners that we 
could fight the staff on the language (i.e. agree to disagree and let the 
Commissioners decide).

Stay tuned for more action on this very hot topic.....

When you get a few minutes, I would like to disucss the county's rezoning 
application and the Appian professional services agreement.  We hope to get 
Appian started quickly so that we can get on the planning board and 
commissioners' agendas.  I will be out of the office Wednesday and Thursday.  
Please talk with Jeffrey if you have any questions.

Thank you very much,

Reagan

Brian,

The termination agreement needs to be signed at the same time.  Here is what 
I have as the latest draft:

I never received a copy of the assignment and assumption agreemen, and the 
legal assistants have not been able to locate it.  Has anyone found it?  If 
not, we need to get a copy from GE.

Kay

Please print for me.

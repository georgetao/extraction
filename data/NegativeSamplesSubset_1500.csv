Under our plan we would be permitted to sell electricity to third parties including the state Department of Water Resources until a resolution to the crisis can be accomplished wood said
We're still reviewing the decision and should have more to say in a day or two
We absolutely need the right to sell to third parties said Dean Vanech president of Delta Power a New Jersey company that owns five small gas fired plants in California and is owed tens of millions of dollars by Edison
By contrast if the RMR units had not experienced outages and been available from April through May Williams Energy would have received either the market revenues only from the respective units which would have resulted in no payments for RMR output from the ISO to Williams Energy or Williams Energy's variable cost for operating the RMR units less the market revenues from the respective units' output

155,"I would recommend reading the whole text if you have time, and if you seek perverse entertainment.",0
156,California is experiencing major problems with electricity supply and pricing caused by policies and procedures adopted over the past ten years.,0
157,"Since June, wholesale prices for electrical power in California have increased on average 270% over the same period in 1999, resulting in over 1 billion in excess payments for electricity.",0
158,"Hot weather, aging power plant and transmission infrastructure, and dysfunctional bidding behavior in the wholesale power markets combined to drive prices up ... Because of serious market defects and tight supply of electricity, purchasers of California power will likely pay billions more in electricity costs this year.",0
159,"Moreover, these price increases do not necessarily fund new investments in electricity supply or delivery reliability - they may flow solely to power producer profit margins.",0
160,"Despite the Electricity Oversight Board's legislative mandate to oversee those institutions, we have been unable to obtain bid data.",0
161,"Nevertheless, ... , we believe enough evidence of questionable behavior exists that the Attorney General should conduct an investigation into these statewide market practices, coordinating with other State agencies, including the PUC and the EOB.",0
162,Such an investigation would provide the factual foundation that California policy makers and regulators need to recover any illegally obtained profits.,0
163,A momentous consequence of California's attempt to create a market in electricity is that the federal government now regulates California's electric system.,0
164,"Washington D.C. now controls pricing decisions directly at the wholesale level and indirectly at the retail level and, to the extent that supply incentives are correlated to prices, Washington, D.C. now affects California's ability to attract new investment in power plants.",0
165,Past administrations' willingness to cede the State's authority to the federal government combined with the legislative creation of two non-public supervisory organizations that have no duty to protect the public or consider the retail customer.,0
166,"The Independent System Operator ISO and the Power Exchange PX , the nonprofit private corporations that operate the State's transmission system and control wholesale pricing policies, are governed by boards whose members can have serious conflicts of interest.",0
167,Some of these board members or their companies financially benefit from higher prices in electricity markets.,0
168,"Neither of these private organizations is accountable to the State or its consumers .... Despite the federalization and the fragmentation of the State's electric services, the State of California should protect its businesses and consumers from cartel pricing; collusive behavior; inadequate power plant maintenance and lack of market planning for adequate electricity supplies.",0
169,California consumers and businesses deserve to know in advance - as San Diegans did not this summer - how and when the price of an essential service like electricity will double.,0
170,California is now largely constrained by federal mandates from providing comprehensive retail price relief as long as wholesale prices remain so high.,0
171,"If California tried to re-impose a price freeze in San Diego now, federal regulators would likely prevent that action.",0
172,We have been precluded from obtaining the data necessary to know if the ISO and PX failed to detect manipulation and gaming on several fronts.,0

221,"If the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase price ceiling because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose , it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to meet its needs.",0
222,"Therefore, an increase in out-of-market OOM calls for generation may be necessary to maintain system reliability.",0

250,he said to himself.,0
251,As he was walking alongside the river he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him.,0
252,"As he turned to look, he saw a 7 foot grizzly bear charging towards him.",0
253,He ran as fast as he could up the path.,0
254,He looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was closing in on him.,0
255,"He tried to run even faster, so scared that tears were coming to his eyes.",0
256,"His heart was pumping frantically as he tried to run even faster, but he tripped and fell on the ground.",0
257,He rolled over to pick himself up and saw the bear right on top of him raising its paw to kill him.,0

263,Very well said the voice.,0

339,"In a nutshell, our strategy seems to have worked and we've won all the concessions we sought.",0
340,"As you'll recall these were: a to get the BLM to withdraw any interim policies, the first of which split fiber cables into 144 different ROW certifications, and a later version that re-packaged the issue, mandating that ROW certificates be issued each time a fiber owner subleases or sells capacity on its line, with a retroactivity clause that added extra sting; b to get the Forest Service to retract its May 2nd memorandum which changed its fiber optic ROW policy from published fee schedules to individual comparable assessments the first such assessment, which compared ROW fees in urban centers in downtown Portland and Seattle to Oregon forest lands, increased the cost of a segment of our FTV fiber build 150 fold ; c to block both agencies from implementing any proposed or final rule in FY 2001; and d to create an open rule making process that involves all interested stakeholders, including Enron.",0
341,"Thanks to the considerable pressure we orchestrated from Congress and the Administration, BLM Director Fry and USFS Chief Dombeck have backed away from points a and b above, and have agreed to points c and d. The language we inserted in the Interior Appropriations Bill, which has been agreed to by the Conferees, forces both agencies to revert back to the published fee schedules, prevents them from implementing any new policies in FY 2001, and forces them to work with industry and to come up with a common policy for future rent determination.",0
342,The reference in the opening sentence to gravitationally-challenged women is because the issue still hasn't quite closed.,0
343,The Interior Appropriations Bill may very well be vetoed.,0
344,"But since our issue was settled at the staff level, and is now off the table, we're likely to remain safe from being re-examined and challenged.",1
345,"In fact, any changes would likely only increase the strength of our hand: some members of our coalition are trying to insert even more detailed language in the report that prescribes exactly how the agencies will proceed to determine the new rental fee schedules over the next 18 months.",0
346,"Through outside consultants, we've had a series of constructive discussions with the agencies over the past two weeks that have forged agreements on timing and specific ways forward.",0
347,"Details are forthcoming, but Enron would be involved closely in the process.",0
348,"The agencies were clearly surprised by the clout we wielded, and are now more than willing to negotiate.",0
349,"But the bottom line, again, is that we have stopped both agencies from implementing their costly interim policies or launching a rule making process either now which they originally intended to do or in the coming fiscal year.",0
350,"And by engaging key Members of Congress and the White House, and organizing and leading the 20-member Fiber Optic Public Land Right-of-Way Coalition, we've succeeded in branding Enron as a leader in the communications field.",0
351,Steve,0
352,A representative from the White House transition team joined the conversation.,0
353,I was asked the terms under which we were prepared to negotiate and I told them at a minimum upon a commitment by the Indian authorities to serious negotiations which would include full compliance with the terms of the contracts and progress in the reform of the MSEB.,0
354,I made clear that we do not see the Godbole Committee as the basis for such a discussion.,0
355,I think the USG wants to be on record politically encouraging the Indian Govt.,0
356,"to engage in discussions all parties consider to be meaningful in hopes of working things out before it is too late, even while through OPIC and EXIM it is supporting the move towards PNT.",0
357,The administration may be concerned that without such a diplomatic overture on its part it could be concluded that the USG has politically taken a position on the project.,0
358,"In Trakya, for example, the USG has been quite proactive in pressing the Turkish govt on the payments issue and even in discussing the payment concerns with the IMF so that the payments issues for the BOTs two of the four in Turkey are US sponsored are taken into account as the IMF program moves forward.",0
359,So I anticipate that the USG will shortly be meeting with the Indian ambassador here and the US Charge in Delhiwill likely be directed to make the rounds and meet with senior government officals on the project.,0
360,I wanted you to be aware of this; also any guidance you can provide would be helpful.,1

475,Another Stage 3 emergency and rolling blackouts Market power There are continued indications that the issue of market power will not be settled simply.,0
476,This week there was a lengthy and politically influential front page story in the New York Times about FERCs passive approach to policing generators Critics Say U.S. Energy Agency Is Weak in Oversight of Utilities .,0
477,The story was by Jeff Gerth and Joseph Kahn.,0
478,Jeff Gerth's 1992 story on the Whitewater deal is viewed by journalists to have been the origin of what eventually became a multi-year investigation of Bill Clinton.,0
479,See the discussion in the New York Times article on the good hours vs. bad hours approach and the associated political decision not to deal with good hours .,0
480,Can market power be used as leverage to eventually settle generator bills in California at something less than 100 cents on the dollar.,0
481,The California ISO filed a complaint claiming 6 billion in overcharges this week.,0
482,"The QF irony Through the 1990s, QF contracts were projected to be the source of stranded costs because they were priced way above market.",0
483,"In recent months, in California, they look like a bargain although some are not such great bargains because a portion of their price is tied to gas .",0
484,You would think that the utilities would request QFs to maximize their output.,0
485,But credit problems have created an ironical situation.,0
486,PG&E and Edison have not been paying the QFs fully and promptly for some time.,0
487,The QFs form a creditors committee and threaten to push PG&E and Edison into bankruptcy.,0
488,Some gas-fired QFs had to shut down because they did not have money to pay for the gas.,0
489,Last week's court decision allows MidAmerican/CalEnergy to essentially sell its power to others even though the QF contract dedicates the output to the purchasing utility.,0
490,"CalEnergy does so immediately, selling to El Paso.",0
491,"The Reliant Order A court ordered Reliant to continue to sell to the ISO, when requested, regardless of whether Reliant had been paid fully and promptly for past deliveries to the ISO.",0
492,Reliant announced it will appeal the order.,0
493,This is somewhat of a contrast to the QF situation except that the circumstances governing the 2 situations are probably different.,0
494,The QF contracts pre-date the ISO and are with the utilities and most likely make no reference to providing power during emergencies.,0
495,"In fact, many QF contracts have the opposite provision: authority for the utility to cut takes during so-called light load periods.",0
496,with rolling blackouts this week.,0
497,This prompted everyone to wonder why this was happening in March.,0
498,"Loss of about 3100 MW from QF plants that were forced to shutdown because they could not afford gas bills VV MARKET COMMENTARY For easier printing of all the articles in this section use the file at the end of the section Critics Say U.S. Energy Agency Is Weak in Oversight of Utilities By JEFF GERTH and JOSEPH KAHN 03/23/2001 The New York Times Page 1, Column 1 c. 2001 New York Times Company WASHINGTON, March 22 -- The pressure was intense when federal regulators met privately last month to debate remedies for soaring electricity prices in California.",0
499,"Officials of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency whose mandate is to ensure ''just and reasonable'' electricity rates nationwide, had evidence that a few companies had been selling electricity to California at prices far above the cost of generating it.",0
500,The agency faced an imminent deadline to challenge those prices or let the companies possibly pocket hundreds of millions of dollars in unfair profits.,0
501,An internal memorandum laid out two choices.,0
502,"The agency could audit and punish ''bad actors,'' the companies that were exploiting the market.",0
503,"Or it could identify ''bad hours,'' when electricity shortages were most acute and spiking prices were arguably nobody's fault, and order refunds for only the most exorbitant prices.",0
504,"It may be easier to identify bad hours than bad actors,'' the memorandum said.",0
505,The commission took the easier way.,0
506,"It decided not to investigate reports of abuses by companies, but issued an order that could require them to refund to the state utilities up to 124 million collected during a relatively few ''bad hours'' in January and February.",0
507,"That is hundreds of millions of dollars less than California might have claimed, since the most potential overcharging occurred during ''good hours,'' when power was more plentiful but prices were often just as extreme.",0
508,The order ignored those hours.,0
509,"Today, in a criticism of the agency's lack of aggressiveness, California regulators estimated that generators had charged 6.2 billion above competitive levels over 10 months.",0
510,"They urged the agency to dig deeper, hoping it would demand more refunds or other stiff remedies.",0
511,But the agency's track record -- one of complacency in the eyes of state officials -- leaves California regulators skeptical that Washington will confront the big power producers.,0
512,"The small, obscure agency, tucked behind the rail yard of Union Station here, has largely soft-pedaled its role as the electricity industry's top cop, even though it has wide authority to keep power companies in line.",0
513,"To keep rates reasonable, it can impose price caps, strip companies of the right to charge market rates, force them to return excessive profits and even suspend deregulation altogether.",0
514,"Instead, the agency has largely left it to private companies to pry open the 250 billion electricity industry, which has historically been controlled by monopoly utilities and state officials.",0
515,"The agency's defenders, including its chairman, Curt Hebert Jr., a fierce advocate of unfettered markets, say that its largely hands-off approach reflects the delicate balancing of competing interests -- a commitment to protect consumers while not stifling market forces.",0
516,"But politicians, utility executives, energy economists and local regulators say California's rolling blackouts and skyrocketing electricity prices are the signs of a market running amok.",0
517,They accuse the agency of standing aside as companies manipulate their way to windfall profits.,0
518,"The agency's critics, who include one of its own commissioners and numerous staff members, say that its enforcement mission has been blunted by free-market passions and the influence of industry insiders in its ranks.",0
519,"When the agency began its first national investigation of high electricity prices last year, it named a newly recruited industry insider, Scott Miller, to lead the effort.",0
520,Mr. Miller and his colleagues said in their report that there was ''insufficient data'' in California to prove any profiteering by generating companies.,0
521,"Yet his own former employer, PG&E Energy Trading, was at the time a subject of a civil antitrust investigation by the Justice Department that focused on electricity market abuses in New England.",0
522,The agency has given state regulators a lead role in monitoring local power markets.,0
523,"Yet even as these regulators have urged the agency to be more aggressive in investigating suspicions that companies have abused their power in California, New England, the Midwest and the mid-Atlantic, they have frequently been ignored or rebuffed.",0
524,Critics say that the agency began deregulation before it was ready or willing to make sure the markets worked effectively.,0
525,"They accuse it of showing favoritism to industry -- allowing companies, for example, to ignore requirements to file detailed reports of market transactions that are critical to proving accusations of market abuses.",0
526,"We need to wake up to the fact that this is a dysfunctional market that is being gamed and manipulated by those who participate in it,'' said William Massey, a commissioner of the agency who has become one of its leading critics.",0
527,"The agency's inaction, the critics say, leads to ''gaming'' -- jockeying for profits that does not necessarily involve illegality -- and outright market manipulation.",0
528,"Consumers and utilities are the victims, paying billions of dollars more for electricity than if the markets were truly competitive.",0
529,Agency officials acknowledge that enforcement of market rules to curb gaming and manipulation had not been a high priority in previous years.,0
530,But they defended their recent California order as proof that they intend to keep markets free of abuse.,0
531,They add that the agency is also pressuring two generators to refund almost 11 million for possibly manipulating the California market last spring.,0
532,"Agency officials and some outside analysts say that poorly conceived deregulation plans by states, a shortage of power plants, rising natural gas prices, and even the weather have had more impact on electricity prices than abuses by companies or any failings by the agency.",0
533,"They say the agency must balance the competing interests of generators, local regulators and utility companies if it is to keep deregulation on track.",0
534,"We're trying to craft a system that gives breathing room to develop a market, but not so much room that undue market power punishes consumers,'' Mr. Hebert said.",0
535,"Fight Over Deregulation Today's debate traces back to the 1930's, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt backed legislation to break up utility monopolies.",0

540,"The deregulation of the electricity markets began in the late 1980's, after the agency had begun opening the gas markets.",0
541,"By 1996, the commissioners issued a landmark order that forced utility companies to open their transmission lines to other utilities and electricity wholesalers.",0
542,"The commission and many private economists expected that by prying open protected markets, electricity prices would immediately fall.",0
543,"That possibility set off a deregulation frenzy, most prominently in California, New York, New England and the mid-Atlantic states.",0
544,"Generating companies rushed to expand in the new, borderless market.",0
545,But the agency's balancing act has grown more difficult as electricity deregulation has spread nationwide.,0
546,Congress has forced it to trim its staff in recent years.,0
547,Officials complain that investigating abuses in electricity markets strains their resources.,0
548,"And as the California crisis has worsened, the commissioners have begun sparring publicly among themselves about what to do.",0
549,"This week, Mr. Massey, a Democratic commissioner, and Mr. Hebert pronounced AY-bear , a Republican, sat side by side before a House panel and argued diametrically opposed positions.",0
550,Mr. Hebert said high prices in California ''were sending the right signals to get supply there.'',0
551,"Mr. Massey called the prices that generators were charging ''unlawful'' and said that his agency, by not reining them in, ''is simply not doing its job.''",0
552,The agency's leadership has been in flux for months.,0

554,A White House spokeswoman had no comment on the reports.,0
555,"Though Mr. Hebert's positions are not far from those of the Bush administration, his relations with California leaders may have made his position tenuous.",0
556,"Mr. Hebert, a Mississippian who is a close ally of the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, has warred with California politicians who have proposed new solutions to the crisis there.",0
557,"Mr. Hebert, who has served as a commissioner since 1997, has often taken the most ideologically free-market position of any commissioner.",0
558,He flatly rejects the idea of price caps on electricity as hopelessly ineffective and contrary to market forces.,0
559,When Gov.,0
560,"Gray Davis outlined a plan to have the state buy transmission lines to relieve utility companies' debt, Mr. Hebert's response was dismissive.",0
561,"It's not in the interest of the American public,'' he pronounced.",0
562,"Even as new electricity markets opened in the summer of 1999, they started producing nasty shocks.",0
563,The mid-Atlantic region experienced some early volatility.,0
564,"As the turmoil grew, economists began raising the alarm about a phenomenon called ''market power,'' the ability of energy traders in the new national market to sustain prices above the competitive level.",0
565,"Proving such abuses is difficult, because it requires comparing tens of thousands of separate electricity transactions with the costs of the generators that initiated them.",0
566,"Joseph Bowring, who heads the market monitoring unit of the nonprofit entity that operates the mid-Atlantic transmission system, said that power companies there had exercised some market power.",0
567,"But only the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, not local regulators, had the authority to collect the data to determine how much market power had been exercised and whether it had been abusive or not, he said.",0
568,Mr. Bowring said he talked to agency officials about doing so.,0
569,"In the end, Mr. Bowring and several agency officials said, the agency chose not to investigate.",0
570,The decision roiled some agency officials.,0
571,"Ron Rattey, a veteran agency economist, wrote a memorandum last June describing the staff as ''impotent in our ability to monitor, foster, and ensure competitive electric power markets.''",0
572,"The staff, the memorandum said, did not even enforce a requirement that power companies file detailed quarterly reports listing essentially every sale they make.",0
573,Such data would have been useful to Mr. Bowring.,0
574,Local-Federal Clash Local regulators who want to ensure competitive prices often have to act on their own.,0
575,"Monitors in New England have intervened about 600 times since 1999 to correct prices they determined had been caused, at least in part, by market manipulation.",0
576,The federal agency has sometimes chastised them for interfering too much.,0
577,"The industry, not surprisingly, shares that view.",0
578,One vocal critic was Mr. Miller.,0
579,"Before the agency recruited him last July to head its division of energy markets, he was director of policy coordination for the national energy-trading unit of PG&E Corporation, the California holding company whose assets also include Pacific Gas and Electric, the California utility.",0
580,"Although the utility has lost billions of dollars during California's crisis, Mr. Miller's former unit has become one of the most profitable new energy traders nationwide.",0
581,"PG&E Energy Trading, by several estimates, is now the second-largest seller of electricity in New England.",0
582,The company has had a rocky relationship with regulators.,0
583,They intervened several times in 1999 and 2000 to retroactively cancel auctions they said produced excessive profits for PG&E and other companies.,0
584,"Mr. Miller denounced the practice, though he acknowledged in public testimony that his company sometimes charged ''very high'' prices when it could.",0
585,"One person's predatory pricing is another person's competitive advantage,'' Mr. Miller said at a public hearing on deregulation in Texas in 1999.",0
586,"New England regulators too often acted as ''judge, jury and executioner'' when overseeing the market, he said.",0
587,"One year later, Mr. Miller and his new colleagues at the federal agency got a chance to examine New England's problems from the regulators' perspective.",0
588,Their Nov. 1 report attributed New England's frequent price gyrations to technical and regulatory flaws.,0
589,"As Mr. Miller's team was preparing its report, the Justice Department, whose threshold for stepping into possible industry wrongdoing is far higher than the agency's, began looking into whether price spikes in New England pointed to unlawful monopoly power or collusion, people contacted by the department during that inquiry said.",0
590,"One subject of the civil inquiry is possible price manipulation in one of New England's ancillary services markets, people contacted by the department said.",0
591,They said the department was examining whether PG&E and two other companies tried to corner that market for several months early last year.,0
592,"PG&E confirmed that the Justice Department had contacted it, but denies wrongdoing and says it has cooperated with the department's requests.",0
593,Mr. Miller has declined to comment on his role at PG&E or at the agency.,0
594,His supervisors defended his work and said they had detected no conflict of interest between his work at PG&E and his duties at the agency.,0
595,Those duties brought Mr. Miller to California last August.,0
596,"With electricity prices there soaring, he and his colleagues sat down with several utility executives at the agency's San Francisco office.",0
597,"One executive, Gary Stern, director of market monitoring for Southern California Edison, wanted the agency to stop what he suspected were market abuses by power generators.",0
598,He provided a road map to help investigators figure out how power companies traded power contracts -- and whether they had manipulated the markets.,0
599,"But when Mr. Miller and his team approached 11 generators and marketers -- including his old employer -- a few weeks later, they did it their way.",0
600,"They asked eight questions, many of them imprecise, like: ''Describe your strategy for bidding generation resources into market.''",0
601,"This question, Mr. Stern said in a recent interview, ''was equivalent to asking a suspected burglar how he spent his day.''",0
602,Some agency officials also thought the team should probe deeper.,0
603,Mr. Rattey recommended that Mr. Miller seek the quarterly pricing reports that marketers were supposed to file.,0
604,"But his suggestion was not adopted, agency records show.",0
605,"Daniel Larcamp, Mr. Miller's supervisor, said ''there might have been more information that could have been obtained'' in the California inquiry.",0
606,"But he said the commission gave the staff only three months to finish, making it impossible to collect and analyze the reams of data involved.",0
607,"For Mr. Miller, agency documents show, the investigation was so time-consuming that he had no time to fill out the financial disclosure form required of new federal employees.",0
608,"Mr. Miller submitted his form in late January, after a reporter requested it.",0
609,"Agency lawyers approved the form, but only after he provided additional information about his job and compensation from PG&E.",0
610,The lawyers said Mr. Miller's participation had been permissible because PG&E was not the subject of the investigation.,0
611,"When the staff report was issued on Nov. 1, it found high prices and problems in the design of the California market.",0
612,"But while the companies ''had the potential to exercise market power,'' the commission said, there was ''insufficient data'' to prove that they did.",0
613,Some marketers saw the report as an exoneration.,0
614,"This has been looked at several times, most notably by the FERC and nobody has found any evidence of market manipulation and profiteering,'' Rob Doty, the chief financial officer of Dynegy Inc., told a reporter earlier this year.",0
615,California Inquiry The agency has recently shown signs of wanting to apply pressure on generators.,0
616,But its early efforts show how it is treading on new and uncertain turf.,0
617,"When the California crisis grew severe last December, the commission issued a refund order, a shot across the bow for generators charging high prices.",0
618,"It required them to submit detailed data any time they sold electricity in California for more than 150 per megawatt hour, considered at the time a fair estimate of the highest costs any of them faced.",0
619,"It also told generators that for the next several months, they could be forced to give refunds if the agency found that they had charged excessive prices.",0
620,The commission also said that it would examine bidding practices and strategies for withholding generating capacity to ferret out any efforts to artificially raise prices.,0
621,"When the agency's own 60-day deadline for examining market data in January approached, however, it became clear that staff members had not made any detailed examination.",0
622,"Instead, staff members said, the agency scrambled to forge a last-minute compromise that would allow it to issue a statement opposing high prices in the state without a time-consuming investigation.",0
623,"During this scramble, a senior staff member, Kevin Kelly, suggested focusing on bad hours instead of bad actors.",0
624,"Our attempts to find illegal behavior or legal 'misbehavior' by sellers 'bad actors' always seems to fail,'' his memorandum said.",0
625,It said that the agency could more easily blame high prices on acute shortages during the most critical hours.,0
626,The suggestion won the day.,0
627,"The commission decided to limit its order to the hours when California declared a Stage 3 emergency, when supplies are critically low.",0
628,Mr. Stern of Southern California Edison and several private-sector economists have attacked the economic logic of that order.,0
629,They said that the commission has focused on times when prices might be legitimately high.,0
630,"The bigger worry: Generators can and often do sustain artificially high prices when supplies are not as tight, they say.",0
631,"Mr. Massey, the Democratic commissioner, dissented from the decision for those reasons.",0
632,"Because most high-priced transactions in January and February did not occur during bad hours, he argued, the commission effectively chose to bless as ''just and reasonable'' the hefty profits generators are making from the California crisis.",0

989,"Gray Davis has agreed to relieve some generators from having to pay potentially millions of dollars in fees for emitting pollutants into the air, Davis said Tuesday.",0
990,Davis announced two weeks ago that his negotiators had reached deals with 20 generators to supply 43 billion worth of power during the next 10 years.,0
991,"However, the Democratic governor has refused to release any of the contracts or detail various terms, contending that release of such information would hamper the state's ability to negotiate deals with other generators and therefore ultimately would raise prices Californians pay for electricity.",0
992,"Sources familiar with the negotiations, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the agreement reached with Dynegy Inc., a power company based in Houston, is one that includes language requiring that the state pay the cost of credits that allow emissions.",0

994,"We couldn't get them to sign contracts; it was a sticking point, Davis said of the decision to pay the fees of some generators.",0

1023,"Following a preliminary, non-public investigation, FERC directed AES Southland Inc. and Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Co. IN01-3 on March 14 to show cause why they did not violate section 205 of the Federal Power Act FPA by failing to provide power to the California ISO from two reliability must-run RMR generator units during a period in April and May 2000.",0
1024,The investigation responded to a matter referred by the Cal-ISO.,0
1025,"If a violation is found, Williams Energy and AES could be required to refund excess profits of 10.9 million as calculated by FERC and face restrictions on their market-based rate authority for a year.",0
1026,"The show cause order involves two generation units Alamitos 4 and Huntington Beach 2 , owned and operated by AES.",0
1027,"Williams Energy markets all output from the Alamitos and Huntington Beach plants, including the two units at issue here, pursuant to a tolling agreement filed with the Commission.",0
1028,The Cal-ISO designated the two units as RMR units that it could call on when necessary to provide energy and ancillary service essential to the reliability of the California transmission network.,0
1029,The Cal-ISO makes both a fixed payment to the RMR owner or operator to compensate for the RMR unit's availability and a variable payment for the RMR unit's output if the unit is not otherwise participating in the market .,0
1030,"Williams Energy and the Cal-ISO executed RMR agreements, filed as rate schedules with the Commission, allowing the Cal-ISO to dispatch units solely for purposes of meeting local reliability needs or managing intra-zonal congestion.",0
1031,The ISO may dispatch a non-RMR unit if the designated RMR unit is not available.,0
1032,"Under its RMR agreement with the ISO, Williams is paid the greater of its contract price or marginal cost for operating RMR units.",0
1033,"However, if a non-RMR unit has to be dispatched because a designated RMR unit is unavailable, Williams will be paid its bid price, not the RMR contract price.",0
1034,"During the April to May 2000 period, the Cal-ISO sought to dispatch both Alamitos 4 and Huntington Beach 2 as RMR units to provide voltage support.",0
1035,"However, according to the FERC order, Williams Energy refused to make Alamitos 4 available from April 25 through May 5, and to make Huntington Beach 2 available from May 6 through May 11, for reasons not directly related to the necessary and timely maintenance of the units.",0
1036,"Consequently, the Cal-ISO was forced to dispatch non-RMR units at a higher cost, namely, Williams Energy's bid price for service provided by the replacement units.",0
1037,"By contrast, if the RMR units had not experienced outages and been available from April 25 through May 11, Williams Energy would have received either 1 the market revenues only from the respective units, which would have resulted in no payments for RMR output from the ISO to Williams Energy, or 2 Williams Energy's variable cost for operating the RMR units less the market revenues from the respective units' output.",0
1038,"Accordingly, FERC observed, Williams Energy had a financial incentive to prolong any outages of Alamitos 4 and Huntington Beach 2 in April and May 2000.",0
1039,"The bid price for the non-RMR units was at or near the Cal-ISO's then-effective bid cap of 750/MWh, FERC continued.",0
1040,"Therefore, Williams Energy received payments from the Cal-ISO of more than 11.3 million, or about 10.3 million greater than the estimated average variable operating cost of the non-RMR units approximately 63/MWh during the period in question.",0
1041,"This indicates a refund amount, including interest, of nearly 10.9 million.",0
1042,"The information in this order and a non-public appendix, the Commission declared, suggests that AES declared outages at the two RMR units and maintained Huntington Beach 2 in a manner inconsistent with good utility practice, and that Williams Energy took action to extend the outage at Alamitos 4 and to make Huntington Beach 2 unavailable for pretextual reasons.",0
1043,"Based on this information coupled with Williams Energy's financial incentive not to make the Alamitos 4 and Huntington Beach 2 units available, FERC found serious questions about whether 1 AES and Williams Energy violated applicable RMR contracts and tariffs on file with the Commission pursuant to FPA section 205 when they refused to make Alamitos 4 and Huntington Beach 2 available for dispatch by the Cal-ISO; 2 whether Williams acted inconsistently with its market-based rate authority and the market monitoring information protocols of the Cal-ISO's tariff regarding the unavailability of the RMR units during the period at issue; and 3 whether AES violated a tolling agreement on file with the Commission pursuant to section 205.",0
1044,"The Commission identified two remedies for these potential violations: a refund by Williams Energy and/or AES of revenues received greater than the amount that would have collected from the ISO if the RMR units had been available, and a condition on Williams Energy's market-based rate authority.",0
1045,"Specifically, for a one-year period, if an RMR unit were not available when dispatched by the Cal-ISO, a non-RMR unit dispatched in its place would only receive payment according to the terms of the applicable RMR contract.",0
1046,"In other words, Williams Energy would not receive the bid price for operation of the substitute, non- RMR unit.",0
1047,"The Commission directed Williams Energy and AES to show cause, within 20 days, why they should not be found to have committed the above-described violations and why the specified remedies should not be imposed.",0
1048,"Further, to ensure procurement of all relevant information, the Commission instituted a formal, non-public investigation into the operation, maintenance and sales of power from the Alamitos and Huntington Beach plants in 2000 and 2001.",0

1066,"Through vigorous deal making, the Sempra Energy subsidiary has consistently beaten the volatile natural gas market during the last year, and the company stands to reap millions of dollars in savings through a state incentive program that rewards utilities for keeping costs down.",0
1067,"For several years, the utility has been splitting the savings 50-50 with ratepayers whenever the company's gas costs fall slightly below market levels.",0
1068,"Those savings, Gas Co. executives acknowledged, have shot to unprecedented heights during the state's power crisis.",0
1069,"Now, in this climate of high consumer gas bills and runaway market prices, regulators are taking another look at the program.",0
1070,The total windfall under the incentive program has in some years exceeded 20 million.,0
1071,"But the amount for the last 12 months is expected to multiply many times over, company executives said, partly because the Gas Co. has done so well in the wild market by selling, lending and trading gas as well as buying it.",0
1072,The recent market conditions .,0
1073,"could possibly result in some unintended consequences that result in shared savings of benefits that may be more appropriately allocated entirely to ratepayers, the PUC's consumer protection arm, the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, reported Oct. 30, even before the latest upward market spirals.",0
1074,"Gas Co. representatives express frustration, saying they have done what the state has requested under its gas-cost incentive program: Buy smarter, and pass the savings along to its 5 million residential and small-business customers.",0
1075,The company contends it has worked hard to keep bills down and should be rewarded for taking risks to obtain gas at the lowest possible cost.,0
1076,"The PUC, every time we do well, raises the bar on us, said Jim Harrigan, director of gas acquisition.",0
1077,I don't necessarily agree with it.,0
1078,"By virtue of its purchasing power and storage and pipeline capacity, the Gas Co. has become a big player in the regional natural gas market.",0
1079,"In the company's bustling trading room at its Los Angeles headquarters, 15 employees track price movements, pipeline supplies and even the weather via computer, while cutting deals and arranging gas shipments.",0
1080,"Although the Gas Co. buys the commodity for its customers, the company also sells to marketers, other utilities and producers.",0
1081,"State officials say the number of transactions by the company has risen steeply to 10,000 to 20,000 a year, including gas sales along California's border, where prices have rocketed.",0
1082,"The PUC created the cost incentive program for the state's three major gas utilities--San Diego Gas & Electric Co. in 1993, Southern California Gas the next year and PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. in 199",0
1083,"Like Southern California Gas, SDG&E is a subsidiary of Sempra Energy.",0
1084,The program was designed to give utilities added motivation for obtaining gas at the best price for customers.,0
1085,"It replaced lengthy and contentious reviews by the PUC, which assessed whether utilities had purchased gas at reasonable prices and sometimes ordered them to return millions of dollars to customers.",0
1086,"An annual audit of the Gas Co. program and a staff evaluation requested by the PUC recently concluded that the program has achieved many of its goals, but it also proposed adjustments that would give customers a greater share of the rewards.",0
1087,"These incentives were designed in less volatile times, said program supervisor Mark Pocta of the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, which conducted the audit.",0
1088,There is a question of how much should go to ratepayers and shareholders.,0
1089,"His office also plans to assess whether the Gas Co.'s trading had any negative effects on the gas market, resulting in diminished supplies or higher prices for other utilities and their customers.",0
1090,"Under the program, the Gas Co. shares risks and rewards with its ratepayers, but since the program was launched, it has consistently produced awards.",0
1091,"If the cost of gas is 0.5% or more below a benchmark based on monthly gas market indexes, the company and its customers split the savings 50-50.",0
1092,California's gas utilities are not allowed to profit on their raw commodity costs; they merely pass along those costs to ratepayers with no markup.,0
1093,The savings under the incentive program are automatically reflected in consumers' monthly gas bills but are not itemized.,0
1094,"At the end of the year, the utilities request their share of the savings, and the PUC has routinely granted approval.",0
1095,"Then the companies, and thus their shareholders, are paid through customer utility bills.",0
1096,"The resulting bill increases typically have been modest, less than 1%.",0
1097,"But as the awards increase, regulators say, the effect on customers will become more significant unless the present structure is changed.",0
1098,"There's no question, when you start to talk about 100 million or more in savings , and add the company's award into rates in a year, it will make a noticeable difference, said Los Angeles economist Jeff Leitzinger, president of Econ One, who has done consulting for the Gas Co.",0
1099,"Still, he said, ratepayers should bear in mind that they already benefit from below-market gas and transportation costs.",0
1100,"In the early years of the program, records show, the Gas Co.'s awards went from zero to 3.2 million, 10.6 million, 2 million and 7.7 million.",0
1101,Last year's award of 9.8 million is awaiting PUC approval.,0
1102,"This year's proposed award, covering the period through the end of this month, has not yet been submitted by the Gas Co.",0
1103,"But the utility has provided monthly figures and oral updates on a confidential basis to PUC officials, who declined to provide figures.",0
1104,"Harrigan of the Gas Co. said the savings are expected to multiply many times over, largely because the company was well-equipped for the market fluctuations and tried to insulate its customers from high gas prices.",0
1105,"Any trading company, especially one with assets like we have, has benefited from volatility in the market, he said.",0
1106,"Harrigan said, however, that he does not believe the company's level of activity has adversely affected the market and that its trading pales in volume to that of unregulated energy companies.",0
1107,"Anne Smith, the Gas Co.'s vice president of customer service and marketing, said the utility will not release figures for this year's incentive program until they are filed with the PUC in June.",0
1108,"I don't want to interrupt that process, Smith said, noting that the PUC ultimately will determine the company's award.",0
1109,I think they need to focus on what the Gas Co. has done for the ratepayers.,0
1110,It has been immense.,0
1111,"Although the typical monthly gas bill has risen to 80 from 50 a year ago, Gas Co. customers tend to have lower rates than those of other California utilities.",0
1112,"The company's gas procurement cost in February was 66 cents per therm, or 100 cubic feet.",0
1113,"That's more than twice last year's cost but only about half what sister company SDG&E paid for its 740,000 customers in February.",0
1114,It's also much lower than the 1.09 per therm PG&E pays.,0
1115,"We were as upset about the overall gas price increase as anyone else, Harrigan said.",0
1116,"I would rather see the prices of a year ago, even though we managed to do a little better in the recent environment.",0
1117,"When it comes to keeping down costs, regulators say, the Gas Co. has advantages over other utilities in the marketplace.",0
1118,"For one, the company has so much pipeline capacity at major gas basins that it purchases a relatively small portion of its needs--about 10% to 15%--at the California border, where prices in December briefly rose to the equivalent of 6 per therm, or 20 times those a year earlier.",0
1119,This presents opportunities.,0
1120,"At the beginning of the month, they forecast a certain amount of gas they have to buy, said Pocta of the Office of Ratepayer Advocates.",0
1121,"If they go out and buy and do not need to use as much because the weather is more moderate than expected, they can either inject the gas into storage or they can make sales at the border.",0
1122,"Customers, he pointed out, may be entitled to additional benefits because they pay for the interstate and intrastate pipeline capacity and the gas storage that give the company the flexibility to make advantageous deals.",0
1123,"By the same token, we want the Gas Co. .",0
1124,"to go into the market and generate cost savings that can be passed on to the customers, he added.",0
1125,We want them to have incentives.,0
1126,The question is how to balance them.,0
1127,"Under deregulation, the Gas Co. adopted the nontraditional role of marketer, according to a PUC Energy Division report in January.",0
1128,The company makes gas sales at various locations.,0
1129,It engages in exchanges.,0
1130,It makes futures transactions to help stabilize costs.,0
1131,"They look for ways to lower the gas cost, said Richard Myers, program supervisor at the Energy Division.",0
1132,Before they were lots more risk-averse.,0
1133,"Now they feel they can take risks and make money for shareholders, and it is a benefit for ratepayers at the same time.",0
1134,"The incentive programs are tailored to individual utilities, so it is difficult to compare them.",0
1135,"Records show that the shared savings at SDG&E, a much smaller utility, declined steadily from 9.2 million in the 1996-97 cycle to 560,000 in 1999-2000.",0
1136,"Spokesman Ed Van Herik said the falloff largely represents a drop in gas purchases, especially as the company sold off its own gas-fired electricity-generating plants.",0
1137,He said the company does not yet know how much savings have accrued in the last year.,0
1138,"In an annual report to the PUC in February, PG&E said it had no savings under the incentive program and thus it is not entitled to any award for the 1999-2000 cycle.",0
1139,"The Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco-based consumer advocacy group, said it will closely watch the PUC's evaluation of the incentive program at the Gas Co. We want to make sure, given the dramatic changes in the gas market and prices, ratepayers are not left out of the additional benefits, TURN attorney Marcel Hawiger said.",0
1140,We'll look to see whether the mechanism should be changed.,0
1141,"Severin Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at UC Berkeley, said the program should be changed to provide more incentive for utilities to enter long-term contracts that would smooth out volatility in the market.",0

1145,"Not very, says energy trade specialist Edward Krapels, managing director of Boston-based METIS Trading Advisors.",0
1146,"Krapels, a consultant helping major Northeastern utilities, such as Consolidated Edison, design market-hedging programs, adamantly decried what he said are facile comparisons between conditions in New York and California, there being more differences than there are similarities between those two industrial cornerstones of the country's economy in respect to energy security management.",0
1147,"First of all, New York has a more varied portfolio of energy generation sources than California, he said.",0
1148,"California has hydro, nuclear and gas, but when it lost a lot of hydro, the state needed gas to pick up the slack, and the capacity just wasn't there.",0
1149,"In New York's case, the state has oil and coal still in the mix and its overall dependence on gas is much lower than California's, Krapels added.",0
1150,New York avoids making same mistakes Portfolio diversity is one pillar of any effective plan to help New York avoid the same errors made in redesigning California's marketplace.,0
1151,"New York's Independent System Operator ISO , in a new report warning that the state is at an energy crossroads in terms of its capacity adequacy in the immediate future, argues that a concerted effort is required to arrest declining in-state generation capacity reserve margins, and a strategy must be put in place, whether or not new generation comes on-line, in accordance with current anticipated scenarios.",0
1152,"A measure of New York's essential difficulty is that, between 1995 and 2000, statewide demand for electricity grew 2,700 MW, while generating capacity expanded by only 1,060 MW.",0
1153,"With no major new generating plants in downstate New York fully approved, the gap is expected to continue to widen.",0
1154,"To avoid a replication of California's market meltdown the New York ISO calculates the state's daily generating capacity needs to grow by 8,600 MW by 2005, with more than half of that located in New York City and on Long Island.",0
1155,"Expressing concern this may be too big a burden for the current bureaucratic process to bear, the ISO wants to see a state-appointed ombudsman named to help would-be merchant power plant investors plow through red tape.",0
1156,"Increasing New York's generating capacity will also lessen the state's escalating and risky reliance on out-of-state sources of electricity, the ISO added.",0
1157,"Since 1999, New York State has been unable to cover its reserve requirements from in-state sources.",0
1158,"Not everyone agrees with that analysis, insofar as it argues for circling the wagons inward.",0
1159,"Some analysts believe the ultimate solution lies not in tying in more inwardly dedicated power, but in expanding the marketplace by breaking down inter-jurisdictional barriers.",0
1160,"In any case, New York energy regulatory authorities and those responsible elsewhere in the U.S. Northeast, such as PJM Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection and the New England Power Pool, are in vastly better shape in terms of cross-border cooperation than California and its neighbors in that efforts are being made among various authorities toward developing an integrated regional electricity market.",0
1161,Embedded image moved to file: pic05075.pcx The New York ISO's new broad-based analysis of market-restructuring needs argues that the relatively stronger health of its reformed environment is due in large part to the ability of New York's utilities to enter into long-term power contracts.,0
1162,"What needs to be done most, it says, is to move aggressively to build some of the more than 29,000 MW of proposed new generation in the siting pipeline.",0
1163,"In the meantime, the 30,200 MW of electricity New Yorkers used on a peak day last summer shouldn't be eclipsed on too many days this coming summer given early long-range weather forecasts .",0
1164,"Demand, however, is expected to increase at an annual average rate of up to 1.4%.",0
1165,"So while New York City, the rest of the state and adjacent parts might breathe easy this year, it could be a brief rest from the fray.",0
1166,"Meanwhile, a 4% shortfall is still being planned for this summer that is not yet provided for, as authorities hurriedly seek to arrange new generation plants around Manhattan, on Long Island and even on barges offshore.",0
1167,"One way or another, whether it is the weather or the politics of siting new energy facilities, it's going to be a hot time in the city.",0
1168,"Long-term solutions hit brick wall Meanwhile, attempts at longer-term solutions continue to run into trouble.",0
1169,"Last week, Connecticut state regulators came out against a proposal to run a new underwater cable under Long Island Sound that Hydro-Quebec subsidiary TransEnergie U.S. Ltd. wants to build to pump more juice into Long Island Power Authority's load pocket.",0
1170,"Despite strong promises from TransEnergie to be diligent in avoiding damage to oyster beds in Long Island Sound, the proposal failed to convince authorities, who were persuaded the pipeline project could lead to diversion of electricity from Connecticut.",0
1171,"The David vs. Goliath nature of such controversies has further alerted energy companies to the difficulties of addressing complex energy supply issues that may ultimately devolve to people not wanting things in their backyard, regardless of what the alternative might mean to their fellow citizens or the greater public good.",0

1175,"NEW YORK: NY-ISO REPORT SAYS STATE NEEDS 4,000 - 5,000 MW OF NEW GENERATION SOON TO AVOID SEVERE SHORTAGES; NY-ISO ALSO ASKS FERC TO EXTEND BID CAP AND TEMPORARY EMERGENCY PROCEDURES 03/21/2001 Foster Electric Report 2 c Copyright 2001, Foster Associates, Inc. Raising the specter of an East Coast version of the California crisis, the New York Independent System Operator, Inc. NY-ISO is warning of serious electricity shortages, air quality deterioration and stunted economic growth without immediate approval of between 4,000-5,000 MW of new generating capacity in the state.",0
1176,"Of this amount, 2,000-3,000 MW is needed to serve New York City.",0
1177,"Another 8,600 MW of new capacity will have to be built by 2005, the NY-ISO said in a recent report, Power Alert: New York's Energy Crossroads.",0
1178,"New York is heading towards a very serious situation unless it acts immediately to get new supply sited within its borders, said NY-ISO president William Museler in a statement accompanying the report.",0
1179,This report is essentially a caution light at New York's energy crossroads.,0
1180,"Sources in the New York Public Service Commission have downplayed the NY-ISO's warning, asserting that a process for bringing on new generation is well underway, with more than 85 projects in the approval pipeline.",0
1181,"In a related development, the NY-ISO asked FERC to approve a proposed tariff amendment ER01-1517 extending existing bids caps in some of its markets until 10/31/02, and a separate and related amendment ER01-1489 extending the NY-ISO's so-called temporary extraordinary procedures TEP that allow the ISO to make price adjustments and take other corrective actions if it finds evidence of market power abuse.",0
1182,"The NY-ISO Report --The NY-ISO likened the situation in New York to that faced by California, where a relentless increase in demand has not been met with an equal increase in supply.",0
1183,"The NY-ISO said that between 1995 and 2000, statewide demand for electricity rose by 2,700 MW, while generating capacity increased by only 1,060 MW.",0
1184,"With no major new generating plants in downstate New York fully approved for construction at this time and generation demand in the state expected to grow around 1.3 percent annually for the next several years, the NY-ISO said this gap will continue to widen.",0
1185,The inevitable result of this trend is large rate increases for New York's power consumers.,0
1186,"The NY-ISO's modeling suggests that by 2005, statewide prices are likely to be more than 20-25 percent lower in the case in which new plants are built than in the case where they are not.",0
1187,"In New York City, the price to consumers of electric power could be reduced by as much as 28 percent when compared to the case of no new supply or load management programs.",0
1188,"Besides large rate increases, the NY-ISO asserted that a failure to site and build new plants in New York will threaten power reliability in the state and lead to increasing reliance on out-of-state resources.",0
1189,"The report said that if no new in-state generation comes on line in the next five years, the state's generation reserve margins will shrink from the current 14.9 percent above peak demand to a dangerously low 8.4 percent by 2005.",0
1190,"Pointing to California's situation, the report added that increased reliance on power imports can subject electrical suppliers and customers in New York to transmission restrictions and political and economic considerations beyond the control or influence of responsible New York State entities.",0
1191,"To avoid these harsh consequences, the NY-ISO said New York's new siting law, known as the Article X process, needs to be modified.",0
1192,"Since the law was passed 18 months ago, the report noted that only two plants have been approved both upstate and neither has yet been built.",0
1193,"The problem, according to the NY-ISO, is that the siting process requires the cooperation of multiple state agencies.",0
1194,"To expedite the process, the report suggested the clear designation of a lead agency and the adoption of an ombudsman program' to expedite and coordinate the work of the agencies responsible for the Article X process must be made.",0
1195,"The NY-ISO added that an expedited approval process would improve the environment because older, more polluting power plants would be replaced by cleaner gas-fired units.",0
1196,"On a more positive note, the NY-ISO reported that New York's restructured power market is far healthier than that in California, due in large part to the ability of New York s utilities to enter long-term power contracts.",0
1197,The basic structure of the New York market will also reduce unwarranted price spikes and other market disruptions through mitigation programs which automatically correct price spikes due to market power abuses.,0
1198,"Nevertheless, California s experience raises a caution flag for all New Yorkers, the report continued.",0
1199,"The deregulated market in New York cannot achieve lower costs through competition without an increase in generating capacity similar in magnitude to the recommendations of this report, along with simultaneous efforts to institute greater conservation, better load management and alternative energy supply initiatives.",0
1200,"Additionally, closer integration with regional suppliers of power is both inevitable and beneficial.",0
1201,"The report also recommended 1 accelerating conservation, real-time metering and price-sensitive load programs; and 2 upgrading the state's and the Northeast's transmission infrastructure.",0
1202,"The Proposed Tariff Amendments -- New York's Article X siting process and continuing tight supplies were also cited in the NY-ISO's request to extend from 4/30/01 until 10/31/02 its 1,000/MWh bid caps.",0
1203,"FERC first approved the 1,000/MWh bid caps in July 2000 see REPORT No.197, pg.6 , and subsequently extended them.",0
1204,"The NY-ISO's board is sensitive to the Commission's concerns about undue intervention in energy markets, the filing related.",0
1205,"Nevertheless, the NY-ISO is submitting this request because it believes that delays in New York state's Article X' process for licensing and siting new generating capacity is inhibiting supply from increasing to match continued demand growth.",0
1206,"Moreover, although the NY-ISO proposes to implement several demand-side measures this summer, it is not yet clear whether they will make demand sufficiently price-responsive to avoid periods of high prices that would not occur if there were an efficient demand-side response.",0
1207,"Thus, the NY-ISO insisted that the requested extension is needed to provide more time for the development of additional generation and to gauge the effectiveness of the NY-ISO's proposed demand-side response mechanisms in order to avoid exposing consumers to price spikes that are not a product of the interplay of competitive market forces.",0
1208,"Other problems cited in the NY-ISO's filing which keep New York's power market from being fully competitive include continuing capacity and operating constraints at the state's Central-East interface, and questions over adequate gas supply.",0
1209,"The NY-ISO remains acutely aware that taking steps to deal with price abnormalities can have undesirable consequences, the filing continued.",0
1210,"Nevertheless, the NY-ISO believes that the 1,000/MWh cap that has been used in the PJM's markets since inception does not appear to have had an adverse impact there.",0
1211,"The permanent bid caps in PJM, and the interim bid caps in ISO New England proposed for extension through the end of 2001 also make continuation of the NY-ISO's bid caps more important in order to maintain uniformity across the Northeastern markets.",0
1212,"The NY-ISO also continues to believe that suppliers will not be materially harmed by the continuation of bid caps, which are likely to come into effect very rarely and are set at levels that prevent only artificially high run-ups in prices.",0
1213,"The NY-ISO's request to extend its TEP procedures which also were previously extended through 10/31/02 cited similar problems with New York's power markets, but claimed that the NY-ISO has made great strides toward eliminating market design and software flaws.",0
1214,"The TEPs were, and remain, an indispensable tool for responding to and correcting market flaws and other instances where the markets are not operating as the NY-ISO and the Commission intended, the filing insisted.",0
1215,MASSACHUSETTS: Attorney general says summer poses electricity concerns By JOHN McELHENNY Associated Press Writer 03/19/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001.,0
1218,BOSTON AP - The state's top consumer advocate warned that Massachusetts may see California-type electricity blackouts this summer when temperatures rise and residents turn on air conditioners and fans.,0
1219,"It would be a mistake to feel this is a cold weather problem, said Attorney General Thomas Reilly in an interview with The Associated Press.",0
1220,Our major problem will come this summer.,0
1221,"State deregulation of the electric industry has been among the factors blamed for local power outages in California, and on Monday, California for the first time suffered rolling blackouts across the entire state.",0
1222,Massachusetts relaxed regulations on its own electric industry in 1998 to attract more companies to stir competition.,0
1223,"But that hasn't happened yet, largely because the current high cost of oil and gas make it expensive to produce electricity.",0
1224,"The promise of deregulation was that there was going to be competition, said Reilly, a Democrat.",0
1225,That competition in the wholesale market is not happening.,0
1226,"Hot summer weather drives up electricity use as residents turn on air conditioners and fans, and Reilly said a few particularly hot days could strain the grid that provides the region's power.",0
1227,"A spokeswoman for the region's power grid said electricity use is expected to rise 1.5 to 2 percent this year, but the region should have enough power because of six new power plants that have begun generating electricity in the past 18 months.",0
1228,"The situation is unlike California because we have new generation coming on line that is outpacing demand, said Ellen Foley, spokeswoman for ISO New England Inc., which manages the grid of 330 generators connected by 8,000 miles of high voltage transmission lines.",0
1229,"Still, a particularly hot day and an unforeseen power generation breakdown could prompt ISO to ask residents to conserve electricity, a situation that arose once last summer, Foley said.",0
1230,"In order to avoid any power outages and protect consumers, Reilly repeated calls for electric companies to build more power lines and to offer more options for new customers who have signed up since deregulation.",0
1231,Those customers typically pay more than long-term customers.,0
1232,"Electric transmission companies should also be allowed to enter into two-year contracts with suppliers, instead of the six-month contracts many have now, to avoid short-term price spikes for consumers, Reilly said.",0
1233,The Attorney General's Office acts as an advocate for consumers.,0
1234,"Michael Monahan, a spokesman for NSTAR, which provides electricity to more than 1 million customers, is upgrading some of its power lines and last year built a new line to Cape Cod, but currently has no lines under construction.",0
1235,"I wholeheartedly concur with the attorney general that it's something we have to focus on, Monahan said, but he added, The indications I see are that we have an ample supply of electricity.",0
1236,"California's statewide outages were ordered on Monday after a transformer fire, high demand and a lack of electricity imports pushed power reserves to near zero.",0
1237,"California partially deregulated its electric industry in 1996, two years before Massachusetts.",0
1240,"CARSON CITY, Nev. AP - Lawmakers hit more delays Monday in trying to pass a measure that pulls the plug on the sale of Nevada power plants to avoid California-style energy problems.",0
1241,"The goal of this bill is only stopping the divestiture of power plants and making sure it's constitutional, said Senate Commerce and Labor Chairman Randolph Townsend, R-Reno.",0
1242,And that's not as easy as it sounds.,0
1243,Townsend's comment just before his committee began working on SB253 was prophetic - witnesses kept bringing up the need for more flexibility in the measure.,0
1244,Translation: Don't kill all deals by stopping Reno-based Sierra Pacific Power and Las Vegas-based Nevada Power from selling their Nevada power plants until June 2003 - and possibly until 2006.,0
1245,"Pete Ernaut, a lobbyist for Reliant Energy which has been trying to buy a power plant, said unforeseen market changes could make a plant sale before 2003 a deal that would be in the public's interest.",0
1246,"If you put a two-year moratorium on these plants, all these deals are going to go away, he said.",0
1247,"When the cow leaves the barn, it's difficult to catch.",0
1248,Townsend had hoped to wrap up committee work on SB253 on Monday.,0
1249,Now it's up for review again Wednesday in the Commerce and Labor Committee.,0
1250,Reliant isn't the only company trying to keep power plant purchases alive.,0
1251,"Earlier this month, executives of Pinnacle West Energy told the committee that it's in the public's interest to allow Sierra Pacific Resources to sell its Harry Allen power plant.",0
1252,"The Harry Allen plant produces about 72 megawatts out of the 2,900 megawatts of energy that Nevada utilities generate.",0
1253,Pinnacle has plans to expand that to 700 megawatts by 2004.,0
1254,"Other provisions not strictly related to the plant divestitures, such as ways in which Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power can recover the cost of undoing the sales contracts, don't have to be included in SB253, Townsend said.",0
1255,Townsend said the other concerns dealing with the energy crisis and utility deregulation can be handled in later bills - but the power plant sale issue must be handled now.,0
1256,Nevada's PUC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had directed Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power to sell the plants as a condition of the companies' merger in 1999 under the parent company Sierra Pacific Resources.,0
1257,"Critics of the plant sales say the plants generate about half the state's electricity - and if they're sold, the unregulated new owners could sell the power to other states and put Nevada into the energy dilemma California faces of shrinking supply and rising prices.",0
1258,The Southern Nevada Water Authority has presented an analysis stating that rate payers will save from 1.7 billion to 3.5 billion by July 2001 if the power plant sales are stopped.,0
1259,Nevada's Consumer Advocate's Office previously had projected a conservative estimate of 915 million in savings.,0
1260,MAINE: Panel of experts would review impact of energy deregulation By GLENN ADAMS Associated Press Writer 03/19/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001.,0
1263,"AUGUSTA, Maine AP - In the wake of rolling blackouts in California and rate spikes in their home state, Maine's top legislators proposed a study Monday into the effects of deregulation of the energy industry.",0
1264,"Deregulation of electricity is a new idea and we still have a lot to learn, Senate President Michael Michaud said as he called for the analysis.",0
1265,"A panel of industry insiders, elected officials and consumers would study issues such as what standard rate consumers can expect and the likelihood of energy shortfalls over the next three years, and whether Maine consumers are vulnerable to anti-competitive activities.",0
1266,"In addition, the Blue Ribbon Commission would look into whether changes in Maine's deregulation law are needed to encourage more generating capacity, improve conservation and spur competition.",0
1267,"The study is being proposed as consumers remain mindful of a power crisis in California that resulted from high wholesale energy costs, a consumer rate cap and too few power plants in that deregulated state.",0
1268,"Maine's deregulation law is designed to avoid such pitfalls, said Rep. William Savage, D-Buxton, House chairman of the Legislature's Utilities Committee.",0
1269,"Maine's law does not cap consumer prices, as California's does, and the state has more than enough generating facilities to meet the state's energy needs, Savage said.",0
1270,"Since Maine's deregulation law took effect in March 2000, Bangor Hydro-Electric Co. rates have increased 19 percent.",0
1271,The Public Utilities Commission approved a residential standard rate increase as recently as last month.,0
1272,Federal energy regulators are reviewing their decision to allow steep fee increases for utilities and power wholesalers that fail to arrange enough capacity to meet customers' peak load.,0
1274,Angus King and all four members of Maine's congressional delegation oppose the hike.,0
1275,The PUC has approved standard rate increases for energy delivered by Central Maine Power Co. to medium-sized and large industrial users.,0
1276,"On the other hand, some towns and school districts are saving money on energy through deals they can get in the deregulated market.",0
1277,"In the meantime, legislation has been introduced in response to some of the changes that have occurred in Maine's deregulated energy industry.",0
1278,"One would use some of the money from the sale of power-generating assets to offset an increase in rates paid by large industrial users, said Sen. Norman Ferguson, R-Hanover, Senate chairman of the Utilities Committee.",0
1279,"Supporters of the utility study that was proposed Monday said they are not looking to make changes in Maine's deregulation law, but if it needs fixing it could be done during next year's session.",0
1280,"The lawmakers' primary interest is to find out how trends in a new environment designed to encourage competition will affect consumers, and to try to identify what consumers can expect in the few years ahead.",0
1281,"House Speaker Michael Saxl, D-Portland, said the Legislature has a fundamental public policy interest in making sure rate-payers and businesses are protected against exorbitant rate hikes.",0
1282,"Michaud, D-East Millinocket, said he's interested in finding out how future changes in electric prices and availability might affect businesses and consumers in northern Maine.",0
1283,"The economy in my part of the state is the most vulnerable, and I want to make certain we are leaving no stone unturned in our effort to prevent any shocks to the economy in northern, western and eastern Maine, Michaud added.",0
1284,"The commission would include House and Senate members from each party, a utility executive, and representatives of energy producers, providers, a large commercial consumer and individual consumers.",0
1285,OREGON: State Senate moves to combat energy crisis 03/16/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001.,0
1288,"SALEM, Ore. AP - In an attempt to avoid a California-like energy crisis, the Oregon Senate approved a bill Friday that would quicken the process of siting power plants that use gas and renewable resources.",0
1289,It's important for Oregon.,0
1290,"It makes sure that energy will be available to everyone, said Sen. Lee Beyer, D-Springfield.",0
1291,"The measure, SB843, would shorten the siting process for power plants that use gas and renewable resources, like wind, from a year and a half to a matter of months.",0
1292,The speeded-up process would be in effect for two years.,0
1293,"If we can act now, we can actually start to solve power supply problems by this summer, said Sen. Jason Atkinson, R-Jacksonville California's strict regulations on the construction of new power plants has contributed to its current shortage and legislators took note.",0
1294,"Beyer said though California was definitely a wake-up call, the measure is a reaction to the larger power picture in the Northwest.",0
1295,"With low rainfall, hydroelectric generators will have trouble meeting demand, Beyer said.",0
1296,Gas-fired and wind plants could come online as soon as this fall and would provide relief.,0
1297,"We are not in a position to sit back and do nothing about the energy crisis the Northwest and the country are experiencing, said Senate Minority Leader Kate Brown, D-Portland.",0
1298,"Conservationists, however, caution that lawmakers should be careful not to rush to provide power at the expense of environmental standards.",0
1299,WISCONSIN: Two utilities to add 975 megawatts in plan to avoid energy crisis By The Associated Press 03/22/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001.,0
1302,Plans of two state utilities to add 975 megawatts to Wisconsin's electric power grid as a way of avoiding an energy crisis similar to California's were questioned Thursday by a consumer advocate who said too many power plants may be in the works.,0
1303,"Certainly nobody wants to see blackouts like you have in California but there is the danger Wisconsin could be overbuilding, said Steve Hiniker, executive director of the Citizens' Utility Board, which represents consumer interests in utility rate cases.",0
1304,He noted that plant construction costs ultimately are born by the utility customers.,0
1305,Alliant Energy Corp. announced its proposal Wednesday - in a filing with the state Public Service Commission - to spend 1 billion to build one coal and two gas-fired power plants.,0
1306,Alliant has proposed building a 500 megawatt coal-fired plant and a 100 megawatt natural-gas fired plant by 2006.,0
1307,It also wants to build a 200 megawatt natural gas-fired facility in 2011.,0
1308,Wisconsin has not built a coal-fired plant in more than two decades.,0
1309,Alliant has not determined the plants' locations.,0
1310,"Also, Madison Gas & Electric, the state's smallest investor-owned utility, said Wednesday that it had signed deals to buy 175 megawatts of power from three generating plants in Wisconsin and Illinois.",0
1311,"Three out of the four past summers, we've had public appeals for conservation due to shortages somewhere in the state.",0
1312,"We need to take steps to avoid that, and the California situation makes that even more clear, said Alliant spokesman Chris Schoenherr.",0
1313,Getting more iron in the ground will give us more flexibility in the state to be able to react.,0
1314,"Alliant acknowledged the new plants will probably mean rate increases, but it was too early to say how much rates would go up.",0
1315,"California's problems, which this week resulted in the first deliberate blackouts since World War II, stemmed from underestimating the state's power needs, forcing utilities to sell their power plants but not allowing them to secure long-term supply contracts, and freezing rates, among other things.",0
1316,But Wisconsin's situation is far different.,0
1317,"The state has moved slower than California toward deregulation, and there has been no desire here to speed up the process in recent years as power reliability became a problem.",0
1318,"The PSC estimates that Wisconsin will need an additional 3,000 megawatts of power over the next decade.",0
1319,Hiniker said Wisconsin needs to coordinate its planning to avoid overbuilding.,0
1320,"The costs of new power plants are passed on to ratepayers, meaning electric bills will increase as new generation is added.",0
1321,"In addition, coal-generated power plants are a major source of air pollution in the state.",0
1322,"We don't have the advance planning that has kept Wisconsin from overbuilding in the past, said Hiniker.",0
1323,This is something the PSC should be doing.,0
1324,MG&E's deals are: -A 10-year contract to buy 75 megawatts from Calpine Energy Services starting in May 2004.,0
1325,"The power will come from the natural gas-fired plant Rock River Energy Center, near Beloit.",0
1326,"Calpine Energy Services is a unit of San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine Energy Corp.",0
1327,"The plant is being built by Northbrook, Ill.-based SkyGen Energy LLC, which Calpine bought last year from SkyGen President Michael Polsky and Wisvest Corp., a unit of Wisconsin Energy Corp. -A 10-year contract to buy 50 megawatts of power from the Rainy River Energy Corp. starting in May 2002.",0
1328,"The power is coming from a natural gas-fired plant near Joliet, Ill. owned by LS Power Co. Rainy River is a unit of Duluth-based Minnesota Power Inc. -A five-year contract to buy 50 megawatts from an El Paso Merchant Energy plant near Cordova, Ill., in western Illinois.",0
1329,"The owner of the natural gas facility is the Cordova Energy Center Co., which is a unit of Iowa-based MidAmerican Energy Holdings.",0

1342,There probably isn't anyone in Washington closer to Linda than Wendell as he has known her since she was a child.,0
1343,Andy is expecting either Steve's or Rick's phone call to further discuss the Senator's involvement.,0
1344,"Andy did discuss in general that he wasn't certain whether his client, EPSA, would go along with the strategy but he thought, overall, it was a possibility.",0
1345,Andy's direct number is 202-828-2259.,0
1346,I know Andy and Wendell very well and would like to be helpful as you wish.,0
1347,"However, at this point, I thought an EPSA board member i.e.",0

1357,Non-affiliated competitors continue to build straw men and describe abuses with no real evidence to back them up the funny money argument and capacity hoarding are two examples.,0
1358,The funny money argument assumes marketing affiliates will bid above market rates for capacity because they excess payment is going to the corporate bottom line.,0
1359,"Hoarding capacity to drive up price may be an issue, but it is not a marketing affiliate issue, as anyone can do it .",0
1360,"FERC staff did not seem terribly sympathetic to the points made, but at least one FERC staffer seemed to believe that one solution would be to require the pipelines to offer capacity in smaller blocks to let smaller entities put together bids.",0
1361,"FERC also indicated they were in fact auditing compliance, but in a non-public way.",0
1362,There were some concerns voiced which I agree with and there is an opportunity to file additional comments on Apr.,0
1363,30,0
1364,I would like to put the following in these comments: Evidence of affiliate abuse/preference is just not there.,0
1365,The best folks can do is make up stuff.,0
1366,We welcome FERC monitoring if that is needed to bring confidence to the marketplace that abuse is not occurring.,0
1367,But the issue is really whether we do have a crisis of confidence or merely a bunch of disgruntled competitors who are just seeking to neutralize the affiliated competitors .,0
1368,The FERC rules and the information reported with a caveat under those rules are adequate for detection and enforcement and deterrence.,0
1369,"That said, the definition of marketing affiliate should be expanded to include affiliated electric generators, who are siting plants along affiliate pipelines.",0
1370,"The pipeline 637 reporting and internet systems should allow users to download and manipulate transportation related data, which is not currently the case.",0
1371,"We also need to address a deal on Northern where ENA took capacity at a discount, albeit after other parties had an opportunity to match our bid.",0

1384,"Skilling told us at a floor meeting that as an organization we've made poor decisions in the past, and he believes it's because the people who disagreed with those decisions never spoke up.",0
1385,So help me out,1
1386,I think they would do a good job.,0
1387,Another idea: Dick Foster advisor to Enron's Board and Senior Director at McKinsey has a great book out: Creative Destruction .,0
1388,I was on a panel with him recently where he shared some of his research.,0
1389,He is a very good presenter; he knows Enron well; and his work is first rate.,0
1390,He might be a good addition.,0
1391,I have an idea on the breakout sessions.,0
1392,It needs some work but I'd like to talk it through with you.,0
1393,"I know you have a thousand other things on your plate, not the least of which is California, so I understand if the answer is no.",0
1394,"However, they've been contacted by someone else about the date so we may be forced to decide rather soon.",0
1395,"On a related subject, I'm contemplating another topic for the conference.",0
1396,I'd seen an article in Fortune several months ago titled Managing for the Slowdown.,0
1397,It talked about new challenges managers face in light of the economic downturn.,0
1398,Most young managers have never experienced anything but boom times.,0
1399,The article also outlines a dozen or so things companies should be thinking about now.,0
1400,Use the downturn as a new opportunity to evaluate people.,1
1401,Overhaul your budget process.,1
1402,Don't stop communicating.,1
1403,etc.,0
1404,I think it would be beneficial to address similar strategies and ideas with our managers.,0
1405,I'd love to get your thoughts on this idea.,1
1406,They have another inquiry about that date and wondered if Enron is still considering using Jonas.,0
1407,If you are still considering them I will keep him on hold.,0
1408,And if they get a firm offer I will let you know immediately.,0
1409,We will have 24 hours to make an offer or release the hold once a firm offer comes in from another company.,0

2316,This biopsy confirmed the dentist's opinion and off I went to MD Anderson for examination.,0
2317,MDA was more optimistic of diagnosis but said the area needed to be excised in any event which occured at MDA last Wednesday the 11th .,0
2318,I have been at home recovering since.,0
2319,It has been difficult to speak although it is now much better.,0
2320,I will return to MDA in a month for a follow-up exam.,0

2339,"I am not optimistic primarily because this is handled out of Chennai, as it must since the parents are residents of Andhra Pradesh.",0
2340,"Our earlier requests for visas from Chennai have been a very mixed bag, with us being turned down more often than not.",0
2341,The fact of the matter is that the visa officers in the respective consulates have incredible amounts of discretion and ability to say no.,0
2342,"Once they say no, it is very difficult to reverse.",0
2343,"But I will go through our good contacts at the US Consulate in Mumbai, as this has had more success than us speaking directly to Chennai.",0
2344,You probably remember Krishna from his visits to our Bombay office when he was helping you on a few projects.,0
2345,A brief outline of the facts.,0
2346,1,0
2347,His wife is pregnant.,0
2348,"She gave birth to their daughter, Pallavi, a few years ago after a very complicated pregnancy.",0
2349,Pallavi was a premature child and her survival was a miracle we all thank the Almighty for this wonderful child .,0
2350,Current pregnancy is also very complicated.,0
2351,2,0
2352,Krishna invited his in-laws to visit and stay with them to care for his wife.,0
2353,The application for a tourist visa was denied and the reason given for the denial was that they had overstayed the term of the visa during the previous visit.,0
2354,The irony is that they complied with the US laws: they had asked for an extension of the visa and the extension was granted.,0
2355,"The company can, of course, intervene on Krishna's behalf.",0
2356,Krishna made an outstanding contribution to Enron he is currently a VP and to the American society.,0
2357,I am sure that Ken Lay would have no objections to write a letter on his behalf to the State Department.,0
2358,"I would prefer, however, to try informal channels first to avoid confrontational approach.",0
2359,It may be better for all the involved in the long-run.,0
2360,I hope you can use your personal contacts to intervene on Krishna's behalf and ask for a reversal of the decision on humanitarian grounds.,0

3281,Its an entirely alien concept to him; he'd grown up during the greatest economic boom in modern memory.,0
3282,"His question drove home the fact that we haven't faced a severe, protracted economic setback for nearly 2 decades, leaving us terribly unpracticed at dealing with tough times.",0
3283,"With this recession - long in coming, perhaps long to stay - now officially upon us, it is imperative that corporate leaders relearn a key lesson about how great companies and great people deal with difficult times differently from how they deal with merely good ones.",0
3284,"That lesson is the Stockdale Paradox, a peculiar psychology shown by those who emerge from tough times not just intact, but stronger.",0
3285,Adm. Jim Stockdale was the highest-ranking U.S. military officer in the Hanoi prison camp during the Vietnam War.,0
3286,"Tortured many times during his 8-year imprisonment, Stockdale lived without any prisoner's rights, no set release date and no certainty as to whether he would ever again see his family.",0
3287,He shouldered the burden of command while fighting an internal war against his captors and their attempts to use the prisoners for propaganda.,0
3288,"At one point, he beat himself with a stool and cut himself with a razor, deliberately disfiguring himself so that he could not be put on video as an example of a well-treated prisoner.",0
3289,He exchanged secret intelligence information with his wife through their letters knowing that discovery would mean more torture and perhaps death.,0
3290,"After his release, Stockdale became the first three-star officer in the history of the Navy to wear both aviator wings and the Congressional Medal of Honor.",0
3291,"You can understand, then, my anticipation at the prospect of spending part of an afternoon with Stockdale, who happened to be at the Hoover Institute across the street from my office when I taught at Stanford.",0
3292,"In preparation, I read In Love and War, the book he and his wife wrote to chronicle their experiences those 8 years.",0
3293,"As I read the book, I found myself getting depressed.",0
3294,"It just seemed so bleak - the uncertainty of his fate, the brutality of his captors.",0
3295,"And then it dawned on me: Here I am sitting in my warm comfortable office, looking out over the Stanford campus on a beautiful Saturday afternoon.",0
3296,"I'm getting depressed reading this, and I know that he gets out, reunites with his family and becomes a national hero.",0
3297,"I never lost faith in the end of the story, Stockdale said when I asked him.",0
3298,"I never doubted not only that I would get out, but also that I would prevail in the end and turn the experience into the defining event of my life that, in retrospect, I would not trade.",0
3299,"I didn't say anything for many minutes, and we continued the slow walk toward the faculty club, Stockdale limping and arc-swinging his leg, still stiff from repeated torture.",0
3300,"Oh, that's easy, he said.",0
3301,The optimists.,0
3302,"I don't understand, I said, completely confused.",0
3304,"Oh, they were the ones who said, 'We're going to be out by Christmas.'",0
3305,"And Christmas would come, and Christmas would go.",0
3306,"Then they'd say, 'We're going to be out by Easter.'",0
3307,"And Easter would come, and Easter would go.",0
3308,"And then Thanksgiving, and then it would be Christmas again.",0
3309,And they died of a broken heart.,0
3310,"After another long pause, he turned to me and said, This is a very important lesson.",0
3311,"You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end - which you can never afford to lose - with the need for discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be.",0
3312,"My conversation with Stockdale had a profound influence on me, but I never really considered it a business lesson until my research team began to wrestle with the question of why some companies rise from difficulty to become great while others emerge from those exact same difficulties weakened and dispirited.",0
3313,We found that companies that became great embraced a corporate version of the Stockdale Paradox.,0
3314,"Fannie Mae, for example found itself in the 1982 recession losing 1M every business day, with 56B in loans under water.",0
3315,"Many analysts thought Fannie Mae, which was getting 9% on its mortgage portfolio but paying 15% on the debt it issued, was doomed.",0
3316,"But CEO David Maxwell and his team never wavered in their aim to not merely survive, but also to prevail as a great company.",0
3317,"Yes, they confronted the brutal fact that the interest-rate problem was not going to magically disappear certainly not by Christmas .",0
3318,"Instead of reacting to the recession with mindless restructuring, Fannie Mae rebuilt itself based on its answers to these questions.",0
3319,"Eventually, it generated investor returns nearly eight times those of the general stock market.",0
3320,"When asked how he dealt with the nay Sayers and the analysts who wrote Fannie Mae off, Maxwell said that it was never an issue inside the company.",0
3321,"Of course, we had to stop doing a lot of stupid things, but we never entertained the possibility that we would fail.",0
3322,We were going to use the calamity as an opportunity to remake Fannie Maw into a great company.,0
3323,The sad truth is that most executive teams won't respond that way to these dark days of uncertainty.,0
3324,"Instead of using this recession as an opportunity to fundamentally rethink their business and rebuild a culture of discipline, the will simply restructure, lay off a bunch of people and liquidate their cultural equity.",0
3325,"Mediocre leaders will hold out false hopes for a quick fix, only to watch those hopes be swept away by events.",0
3326,Their companies will begin to die of a broken heart.,0
3327,It need not be this way.,0
3328,"Those who lead with the Stockdale Paradox - those who retain the unwavering faith that they will find a way to prevail in the end, but who also retain the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of reality - will find this an ideal time to rebuild and reinforce greatness.",0
3329,"Used correctly, this recession can be a defining time in your firm's history that , in retrospect, you would not trade.",0
3330,"Used wrongly, this recession will weaken your foundations and make it that much harder to become great.",0
3331,The choice is yours.,0

3333,"FERC bears responsibility to ensure that a workably competitive market exists before California consumers and California's economy are subjected to unconstrained, market-based electricity prices, said Governor Davis in a statement read by Energy Oversight Board Chairman Michael Kahn.",0
3334,"Consequently, I renew my prior request that the Commission act with utmost speed to intervene to the fullest extent possible to restore wholesale prices to fair levels and to remedy harms that have resulted from the exercise of market power.",0
3335,Governor Davis noted that he and state lawmakers have taken dramatic action in recent weeks to provide rate relief.,0
3336,"While these actions should provide short-term rate predictability and longer-term benefits to customers in terms of improved supplies, the fundamental problem of exorbitant wholesale prices still exists and remains the responsibility of FERC to address, said the governor.",0

3352,Please see attached letter below .,0
3353,"# # # SEPTEMBER 12, 2000 STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS TO THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION CONCERNING ITS INVESTIGATION OF WHOLESALE PRICE ESCALATION IN CALIFORNIA The Summer of 2000 has confronted California with an electricity crisis that seriously threatens the safety, health and well being of citizens and businesses throughout the state.",0
3354,"At the heart of the crisis is the extraordinary run up in prices for wholesale electric energy and ancillary services, accompanied by deteriorating service and reliability.",0
3355,"In San Diego, electric customers' bills have more than doubled this summer, threatening permanent harm to businesses and the health and welfare of residential customers in the warm southern climate.",0
3356,All remaining California electric consumers are faced with similar prospects as their legislated rate freeze periods come to an end.,0
3357,In San Francisco we saw rolling blackouts for the first time in our history.,0
3358,"As soon as the dimensions of the crisis became evident, I directed California regulators, including the Public Utilities Commission and the Electricity Oversight Board, and the Independent System Operator, to take immediate steps to identify and implement specific measures to mitigate the damage, including restoring price caps at Summer 1999 levels.",0
3359,"I am happy to report that those measures have been adopted, although not without considerable resistance from self-interested parties.",0
3360,"In recent weeks, I have worked with the California Legislature to enact further relief within the existing framework of options now available to the state.",0
3361,"These include provisions to stabilize retail rates, expedite generation licensing where possible, implement targeted demand reduction and demand response and remove constraints in transmission and distribution systems.",0
3362,I have also established a task force comprised of key state officials which is developing measures to increase energy efficiency and alternative supplies and to expedite permitting by state agencies.,0
3363,"While these actions should provide short-term rate predictability and longer-term benefits to customers in terms of improved supplies, the fundamental problem of exorbitant wholesale prices still exists and remains the responsibility of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to address.",0
3364,No combination of state actions can substitute for federal action to ameliorate the problems in California's wholesale markets.,0
3365,A joint report submitted to me on August 2nd by the Chairman of the California Electricity Oversight Board and the President of the California Public Utilities Commission concluded that exorbitant wholesale prices in California result from wholesale market dysfunction and the exercise of market power by sellers.,0
3366,Subsequent reports by the Market Analysis Department and the Market Surveillance Committee of the California Independent System Operator reach the same conclusions.,0
3367,"Subsequent behavior of wholesale electric prices during August confirms their conclusions, and subjects California to further economic damage.",0
3368,"While I remain hopeful that California wholesale markets may ultimately become competitive and become capable of serving the interests of consumers and the public, I cannot and will not accept the liabilities to California that result from the current situation for even a short period.",0
3369,I intend to take any and all steps necessary to restore economic stability to the electric service infrastructure of California.,0
3370,FERC bears the responsibility under its organic act to assure just and reasonable wholesale electric rates.,0
3371,"FERC bears responsibility to ensure that a workably competitive market exists before California consumers and California's economy are subjected to unconstrained, market-based electricity prices.",0
3373,"### OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---- A00:245 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE September 12, 2000 GOVERNOR DAVIS NAMES KAHN CHAIR OF THE GOVERNOR'S CLEAN ENERGY GREEN TEAM SACRAMENTO - Governor Gray Davis today announced the appointment of Michael A.

3382,"The signing of AB 970 established the Governor's Clean Energy Green Team, which works to streamline the process of creating new power plants to ensure that an adequate supply of power will exist to make a deregulated marketplace work.",0

3408,Donna sent me this quick write up about what she has looked into so far.,0
3409,"Because these questions go beyond a FERC practitioner's expertise, we asked Donna to work with a Constitutional Law expert at V&E to determine whether, and under what circumstances, the President's authority may be extended beyond the authorities discussed in the memo.",0
3410,We will let you know what we learn from that further research.,0
3411,"I read an interesting law review article on The Imposition of Martial Law in the United States, for a discussion of presidential powers.",0
3412,There is no general emergency authority granted the President in the U.S. Constitution.,0
3413,"Also, the article discussed the famous Truman steel mills case, Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 1952 , in which the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional President Truman's seizure of the steel mills during the Korean War.",0
3414,"In that case, in light of a threatened national-wide strike in the national steel industry, President Truman, concerned about the national defense, issued an Executive Order directing the Secretary of Commerce to take possession of most of the steel mills and keep them running.",0
3415,"The Supreme Court said that if the President had authority to take such an action, he had to derive it either from an act of Congress or the Constitution itself.",0
3416,"Since the Supreme Court could not find any seizure authority, it invalidated the President's action.",0
3417,The Supreme Court also rejected the argument that the President had any powers that could be implied from the aggregate of his powers under the Constitution.,0
3418,"Based on the Truman steel mills case, I thought it the wiser course of action to look for specific authorities given to the President by statute which might prove useful.",0
3419,"I could look into this question further, if you would like, but we would be entering martial law-type legal territory, where the President would be acting outside of specific Constitutional or congressional authority which has been described a zone of twilight , and in light of the Truman steel mills case, I don't know how fruitful that might be.",0

I live in Garden Oaks which is located off of the 610 North Loop between Shepherd and Yale near the Heights .	0
Our neighborhood was built in the early 1940's, and the city put in open drainage which is basically ditches in the front of all the properties .	0
Over the past 60 years the drains have filled in and leveled which is preventing the water from flowing correctly to the sewers, and this in turn causes minor flooding and BIG headaches.	0
My address is 236 W. 30th Street and the area of 30th Street I am asking the city to regrade is between Ashland and Yale approximately 2,500 feet .	0
I have been calling the City of Houston Public Works Department 713-247-1000 for about the last 4 years generally once a month to ask them to please come out and regrade our ditches.	0
The Public Works Department only has records over the last year because they changed their computer system and lost many files including mine.	0
For the last year or so I have been receiving a more positive response when I call which is: This is a Code 1 priority and will schedule as work load allows.	0
Although this response is encouraging, I still feel that my request is falling on deaf ears.	0
Kevin suggested that perhaps a call or letter to a city council person might help expedite this work request.	0
I would be extremely grateful if there is anything you could do to help me and my neighbors.	1

I cannot give you a personal recommendation per se because, in the end, I opted not to hire an attorney to file my patent until I had decided whether I wanted to protect my work as a trade secret or as a patented commodity.	0
I ultimately struck a compromise position by filing my own provisional patent application.	0
or not; it also provides patent pending protection from the date I filed it with the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office.	0
In the process of investigating the options for safeguarding my intellectual property, however, I did talk to quite a number of patent attorneys.	0
Of these, I think that perhaps David Richie might be the most appropriate for your son's software idea.	0
He talked as though he had a particular specialty in software issues; he also struck me as competent and aggressive.	0
He practices in the Silicon Valley and can be reached at telephone number 408 282-18	0
I suspect that he has already done so, but if not, your son might want to visit the internet site of the U. S. Patent Office.	0
Basic information and forms can be downloaded from there.	0
Two other, newer sites might also intrigue him-both deal with the protection, valuation and marketing of intellectual property, patents, etc.	0
They are: pl-x.com The Patent and License Exchange, Inc. yet2come.com Hope this is helpful.	0

Who would have guessed that the California power crisis and Gray Davis could be so funny.	0
Kevin Los Angeles Daily News Friday, June 22, 2001 'Tonight Show' pokes fun at power crisis By Fred Shuster Staff Writer BURBANK -- Jay Leno pulled the plug on his late-night chat show Thursday, doing his part for the state's energy crisis, but viewers weren't left in the dark.	0
Flashlights, mining helmets and multicolor glow sticks helped to illuminate the set for the show dubbed a one-time-only The Tonight Show Unplugged, which Leno said saved enough electricity to light a house for a month.	0
IMAGE The unplugged edition of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno pokes fun at the California power crisis Reed Saxon / A.P.	0
Call it NBC's Can't See TV.	0
This is not some cheap rating ploy.	0
If this works, they're gonna make us do this every night, Leno joked as part of his opening monologue.	0
The nationally broadcast show, featuring a comic interlude with California Gov.	0
Gray Davis, utilized just a small amount of electricity to run the cameras, Leno said before the show began.	0
Actually, in Burbank, where the taping took place at NBC Studios, the city owns the power company and residents and businesses have not been hit by rolling blackouts as in other areas.	0
The city made 5 million in profit in May after racking up 60 million in excess power sales.	0
But Leno said not using studio lights, TV monitors, amplifiers and other power sources Thursday saved enough electricity to light a four-bedroom house for a month.	0
Members of the house band wore miner's helmets, with group leader Kevin Eubanks strumming an acoustic guitar rather than his regular electric instrument.	0
The stage was lit by candles, torches and flashlight beams trained on Leno.	0
Members of the studio audience used the gear to help brighten the set.	0
This is real goofy, Leno said before taping got under way.	0
We'll see what happens.	0
Guests included Arsenio Hall, Gilbert Gottfried, a trainer of nocturnal animals and a Hawaiian fire dancer -- and a brief visit from the governor.	0
Exuding whatever is the direct opposite of charisma, Davis had a brief exchange with Leno, drawing laughs with the line, This is the first time Gray Davis and the word electricity have ever appeared in the same sentence.	0
Leno's staff wore glasses with small lights attached and audience prompter Bob Perlow held a hand-scrawled applause sign aloft throughout the show instead of switching on the usual electric model.	0
While there was little energy in play, there was no shortage of laughs.	0
Leno joked that President George W. Bush told Davis not to worry because, I've been operating in the dark for years.	0
Those in the studio said Leno's nocturnal transmission added excitement to the program.	0
It was cool, said Lillie Harrell, 17, a tourist from Hammond, La.	0
The crowd got really involved.	0
I guess it shows you don't really need all those lights.	0
Added Jose Tano, 21, a Burbank resident and student at the University of California, Los Angeles, It was a good idea and a great way to make a point.	0
The local power company might not have made out very well, but the studio audience didn't end up empty-handed.	0
Each received a fluorescent lantern and pack of batteries as they left the studio.	0
I particularly recommend mistakes and mediocrity.	0
I'm sorry to clog up your email in boxes, but I found the attached to be pretty interesting.	0

He had just gotten off the phone with Massey.	0
Massey believes Linda B. is spending time at the White House lobbying to be Chair.	0
I would prefer backing Massey.	0
The President will then name a new Chairman.	0
Bill Massey is quite interested in receiving the nomination.	0
Please call to discuss.	1

I was glad to do it and would do it again... next time my computer will work.	0
I benefitted a great deal from what I heard from the group, especially regarding the PRC.	0
FYI -- we conducted a post-event survey on opinions about the HR employee meeting held last month and the HR management team thought you should know that participants rated your presentation very high.	0
When asked what should be kept the same next time, participants commented as follows about your presentation: I think a presentation from Corporate HR is of great value.	0
Keep the presentations by the officers .	1
to talk about the business.	0
I liked having other people from ETS/Enron there to better understand the big picture and where Enron is going.	0
Continue to bring in invited guests to keep the group apprised of Corporate activities.	1
I liked the opportunity to hear both Stan and Steve--the field staff don't get as many opportunities to hear from corporate management.	0
Visits by Steve Kean and Stan Horton.	0
Their perspectives are very good .	0
Clearly, your participation provided much value to the group and we appreciate very much your taking the time to come meet with us and share information.	0
You should expect that we'll be asking you to come back again	0

The following developments indicate that the legislation is still very much in play, but our primary concerns are making sure efforts going forward remain under control and preventing the passage of legislation that goes too far.	0
Developments: House Republican leadership is not interested in pursuing the legislation any further, either through regular procedures or as an attachment to appropriations, omnibus or other must-pass measures.	0
They are somewhat angry at the industry for not being able to fight off advances made by Reps. Dingell and Oberstar, who were able to persuade enough Democrats to vote against the Senate bill so that it fell short of the 2/3 needed for passage under suspension of the rules.	0
Senate bill sponsors/supporters are extremely angry at House Democrats for killing the Senate legislation, and at the White House/DOT for not strongly promoting the Senate bill which they previously had supported and reigning in House Democrats.	0
Senator Patty Murray called the White House and expressed her concern, which prompted a series of meetings between staff for Senate and House Democrats and the White House to discuss a solution.	0
In these meetings, House Democrats have proposed adding several provisions from the Dingell/Oberstar legislation to the Senate bill and moving that package on an omnibus or appropriations bill.	0
Sources close to Rep. Dingell indicate that they really do not want any bill at all, and are merely keeping up the pressure in an effort to see if they can get the Senate or industry to accept tougher provisions.	0
Senate Democrats including Murray, Bingaman, and Breaux are not accepting any possible amendments to the original Senate bill, and are opposed to changing the Senate bill at all.	0
However, Senator Murray and Republican Senator Slade Gorton who has a tough election both want to continue to pursue the Senate bill unamended as a rider to an omnibus/appropriations bill.	0
The White House is looking to cover itself from a poor performance in the House, and is considering drafting an executive order that could be issued if no legislation passes at all.	0
It is unclear what could or would be contained in such an order, but the White House is indicating to Senate staff that it would be more like the Senate bill than the House bill.	0
We are working with sources close to the White House to confirm their strategy.	0
Strategy going forward: Upon hearing that some industry associations were on Capitol Hill discussing what industry could live with in terms of provisions added to the Senate bill, I insisted along with El Paso and others that we not take such an approach, but rather remain consistent in our approach -- we support the Senate bill and only the Senate bill.	0
It was approved unanimously in the Senate and by 60% of the House, and if anything moves forward on an omnibus/appropriations bill, it should be the Senate bill.	0
Consistent with what our Senate friends are doing, we should not even recognize the Dingell/Oberstar legislation as a serious proposal, nor start accepting pieces of it as a compromise.	0
We will be shoring up support for our position of if anything moves forward, it should be the Senate bill only with Senate supporters and leadership in the House and Senate.	0
We will also be working to thank the 51 Democrats who supported us in the House, and make sure they have any cover they need in case their vote becomes an issue.	0
In support of Senator Gorton's election troubles, we will be working to try to get media placement of op-eds that support the efforts he has waged and make sure the House Democrats shoulder the blame for the bill's defeat.	0
In particular, we are hopeful that Senator McCain who has been passionate about this issue will write op-eds that can be placed to support Gorton and others in tough races who supported the Senate bill.	0
Congress' state of confusion over omnibus/appropriations bills and last minute politics causes the legislative activity to be extremely fluid and subject to change rapidly, so we will have no real certainty until the session is over which now could be as late as October 20 .	0
I will keep you posted as changes and developments occur.	0

Sorry I left Jimmy off the note, I know he must be doing a good job.	0
I'm certain that the NYT story is infinitely better because of Wade's involvement.	0
It was a team effort, but you should know that Jimmy Mogal also was very involved.	0
Of course, Wade wants to avoid damaging the company and your note helps to keep him up for these risky/must do requests.	0
Along these line, I'd like to be able to give you a brief update on activities and issues.	0
I'll check with Maureen about scheduling 15-20 minutes.	0

These aren't just the minor leaguers in Sacramento, but the big league players in Washington.	0

This week, Governor Gray Davis decided to write his own Burrito.	0
No stone left unturned.	0
They need to clear out.	0
They re-define our reality each week with mind-numbing aplomb.	0
For example, starting in early June, the PX was ordered to compete for business against other Qualified Trading Vehicles.	0
Then, two weeks later, the Energy F hrer legislated that idea to an early death which kept the status quo for at least one year.	0
Zip, bam, boom.	0
Then, they will collect data from innocent businesses under subpoena, ignore the facts, and publish a report.	0
It makes one want to take a deep breath, and inhale the scented fumes of democracy.	0
@@@ The PUC issues its scathing report @@@ The ISO invokes 250 price caps.	0
Duh	0
Well, the answer very clearly is no.	0
Consider the following.	0
First, they waltz their default customers into the summer with little of no protection from price spikes in the wholesale market.	0
Forgivable in that it is human to err.	0
The prices skyrocket in June, and they start looking for who to blame.	0
Must be them damn independent generators,O say their managers.	0
Next, under pressure, they ask for help from suppliers and anyone else who will assist the utility and their customers.	0
Now they are in a panic because the Energy F hrer is visiting old ladies living in trailer parks, advising them not to pay their SDG&E electricity bill, and to continue to operate their air conditioners.	0
SDG&E puts a full page ad in the local newspaper telling everyone that SDG&E is doing everything it can to lower their electric bills, including asking the ISO for a 250 price cap, but the public can help by calling the ISO address and phone number provided in the ad and urging them to lower the cap.	0
I always thought the location of the ISO was a State secret for security reasons.	0
No secrets in San Diego.	0
But we are not done.	0
No sir, we are not.	0
Those buffalo heads who run that company decide they will win a gold star on their collective foreheads, and implement one of the four resolutions passed by the Electric Oversight Board.	0
The one they pick is to petition FERC on an expedited basis to cap at 250, the price at which sellers may bid energy or ancillary services into the ISO and the PX.	0
The primary reason is that Western power markets are not workably competitive.	0
In other words, they want FERC to set a max price on what generators can sell in addition to the price limit at which the ISO can buy	0
What I find most astounding about this double talk is that SDG&E continues to collect tons of money from the sales of regulatory must run energy into the PX.	0
These are sales from their stranded assets.	0
energy is not workably competitive.	0
Too much time in the direct sun light.	0
>>> Things on the Island of California @@@ The PUC issues its scathing report The PUC report released yesterday is a gem with which I have not spent enough time.	0
I only read the Executive Summary, and that only because our counsel, Dan Douglass forwarded me a copy.	0
I would recommend reading the whole text if you have time, and if you seek perverse entertainment.	0
California is experiencing major problems with electricity supply and pricing caused by policies and procedures adopted over the past ten years.	0
Since June, wholesale prices for electrical power in California have increased on average 270% over the same period in 1999, resulting in over 1 billion in excess payments for electricity.	0
Hot weather, aging power plant and transmission infrastructure, and dysfunctional bidding behavior in the wholesale power markets combined to drive prices up ... Because of serious market defects and tight supply of electricity, purchasers of California power will likely pay billions more in electricity costs this year.	0
Moreover, these price increases do not necessarily fund new investments in electricity supply or delivery reliability - they may flow solely to power producer profit margins.	0
Despite the Electricity Oversight Board's legislative mandate to oversee those institutions, we have been unable to obtain bid data.	0
Nevertheless, ... , we believe enough evidence of questionable behavior exists that the Attorney General should conduct an investigation into these statewide market practices, coordinating with other State agencies, including the PUC and the EOB.	0
Such an investigation would provide the factual foundation that California policy makers and regulators need to recover any illegally obtained profits.	0
A momentous consequence of California's attempt to create a market in electricity is that the federal government now regulates California's electric system.	0
Washington D.C. now controls pricing decisions directly at the wholesale level and indirectly at the retail level and, to the extent that supply incentives are correlated to prices, Washington, D.C. now affects California's ability to attract new investment in power plants.	0
Past administrations' willingness to cede the State's authority to the federal government combined with the legislative creation of two non-public supervisory organizations that have no duty to protect the public or consider the retail customer.	0
The Independent System Operator ISO and the Power Exchange PX , the nonprofit private corporations that operate the State's transmission system and control wholesale pricing policies, are governed by boards whose members can have serious conflicts of interest.	0
Some of these board members or their companies financially benefit from higher prices in electricity markets.	0
Neither of these private organizations is accountable to the State or its consumers .... Despite the federalization and the fragmentation of the State's electric services, the State of California should protect its businesses and consumers from cartel pricing; collusive behavior; inadequate power plant maintenance and lack of market planning for adequate electricity supplies.	0
California consumers and businesses deserve to know in advance - as San Diegans did not this summer - how and when the price of an essential service like electricity will double.	0
California is now largely constrained by federal mandates from providing comprehensive retail price relief as long as wholesale prices remain so high.	0
If California tried to re-impose a price freeze in San Diego now, federal regulators would likely prevent that action.	0
We have been precluded from obtaining the data necessary to know if the ISO and PX failed to detect manipulation and gaming on several fronts.	0
We do not know how market players acted in price offering and bidding and scheduling.	0
The FERC has just announced an inquiry into national pricing and energy market issues.	0
California should not wait for national findings before it investigates California market practices.	0
We recommend that the California Attorney General immediately subpoena relevant records and data to determine the pricing and offering behavior of market participants; the actions of the ISO and its board members; and the actions of generators in supplying California's energy needs.	0
Ten Actions to Consider or Act Upon to Prevent Current Electricity Problems From Spreading in 2001: ...	0
Create a California Energy Council, modeled on the National Security Council, to unify State action to resolve energy problems and to perform integrated energy planning;	1
Ask FERC for extended wholesale price cap authority to moderate California wholesale market pricing;	1
Ask FERC to recognize the defects in the California and western regional markets and find that no competitive market exists in California power markets; ... 8.	1
Eliminate potential conflicts of interest in ISO/PX stakeholder boards; 9.	1
Improve California's ability to obtain ISO and generator data and enhance the State's enforcement capability for power plant maintenance; price manipulation and generation gaming, consistent with protection of proprietary business information; 10.	1
Provide the EOB with effective enforcement ability and additional oversight authority for the ISO and PX.	1
Ten Issues to Consider or Act Upon Within the Next Six Months: ... 4.	0
Streamline state power plant siting procedures; consistent with environmental requirements, and prioritize applications to advance clean, BACT power plant proposals.	1
Institute use-it -or- lose-it permitting power plant licensing and emissions credits rules to ensure power plants get built; ... 8.	1
The Democrats in Sacramento are doing that for me.	0
Welcome comrade.	0
>>> Things on the Island of California @@@ The ISO invokes 250 price caps.	0
It is really hard to describe the drama of an ISO Governing Board meeting, especially when our favorite topic arises.	0
It seems the only time the Board becomes animated is when one of three issues are on the agenda: price caps, FTRs, and priorities for software enhancements.	0
Otherwise, its pretty much hum-drum.	0
%Round and %round we went, once again.	0
A few more forced votes tipped the scale in favor of the cap.	0
There were 15 yes votes, which included a forced yes vote from our friend Jerry Toenyes by order of Secretary of Energy Mr. Richardson.	0
Kind of a french thing.	0
You still go in my book as one of the brave and bold for standing up to that sort of intimidation for so long.	0
Your picture in the SF Chron said it all.	0
The brave souls who stood tall and voted NO included David Parquet Enron , Jan Smutny-Jones IEP , Barbara Barkovich CLECA , Caolyn Kehrein CMA , Dan Kirshner EDF , and Stacy Roscoe Procter & Gamble .	0
I have instructed Dynegy trader Dave Francis in Houston to work with Greg to correct that problem.	0
The Energy F hrer addressed the Board, again.	0
Peace got over 20 minutes.	0
He did more damage to himself in 20 than I could do in 2.	0
He blasted away at everyone who opposed him.	0
He pined about Camden quitting the Board.	0
And on and on and on.	0
This man is very delusional.	0
He believes that Steve, and only Steve Peace can save the world.	0
He believes that political will trumps judicial, quasi-judicial, or independent Board actions.	0
This man makes relevant all the abstract musings of the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche 1844-1900 ...	0
his skin, with the help of the press.	0
Dick said he got a call from Peace, and that Peace said he would not come to the meeting.	0
Apparently, Peace had received a lot of press, and all of it bad.	0
>>> Things at the throne of FERC @@@ Amen for the Morgan Stanley Order And now, the good news.	0
You deserve this.	0
FERC gave the California market a little wiggle room last Friday.	0
FERC danced on the head of the ISO and pulled the bite out of the price cap.	0
prices but because it would promote order and transparency in the market by clearly telling sellers of the maximum price the ISO was willing to pay and allowing sellers to make informed economic choices on whether to sell in the ISO market or to sell elsewhere... ...	0
The ISO has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these services ...	0
If the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase price ceiling because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose , it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to meet its needs.	0
Therefore, an increase in out-of-market OOM calls for generation may be necessary to maintain system reliability.	0
Because the current payment for OOM is not subject to a maximum purchase price, the resulting overall payments may be higher.	0
To the extent the ... ISO Board resolution contemplates implementing a directive that generators must bid their capacity into the ISO markets under any circumstances e.g., when system load exceeds 38,000 MW , such a requirement is not permitted by our ... Order and the ISO tariff.	0
Such market changes could not become effective absent a corresponding amendment to the ISO tariff which would have to be filed under section 205 of the FPA.O Well.	0
Just wait.	0
Here is what the sleeping bear, Commissioner Hebert said in his concurring remarks: Getting to the bottom of the problem, in my view, requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our approval of the ISO as the operator of the California grid.	0
The record supports such a move.	0
Because these allegations come from a non-market participant, especially should we take heed.	0
We must also take notice of the public pressure on the Board to compromise its independence.O Amen, brother, amen.	0
>>> Odds and Ends As you can imagine, this week, like an endless string of weeks before this has been interminable.	0
I get about three phone calls a day from press reporters, very little of which ever sees print.	0
My shtick is just too complex for casual readers.	0
But I do notice that the reporters are asking better questions.	0
The public is becoming more savvy.	0
The information flow is moving in our favor, and will disarm the forces of evil, in about 10 years.	0
I have other problems on my mind.	0
I am working on a new computer system.	0
As a result of the all the new hardware and software I purchased, my office looks like a war zone with an odd mix of PUC service copies, computer documentation, and diskettes laying all around.	0
Quite a mess.	0
Prepare for the future.	1
Our next general meeting is scheduled for Thursday and Friday, October 5 and 6 at Moro Bay.	0
Our guest speakers will include MSC Chairman Professor Frank Wolak who will talk on the subject of his choice, Ms. Irene Moosen of Grueneich Resource Advocates who will make a presentation on the distributed generation case before the PUC, and William Freddo of PG&E National Energy Group who will give us some education on operating a power plant inside the New England ISO.	0
Now for your daily bread, provided this week by Dan Douglass.	0
Last week we had a joke about Catholics.	0
0	0
What majestic trees	0
What powerful rivers	0
What beautiful animals	0
he said to himself.	0
As he was walking alongside the river he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him.	0
As he turned to look, he saw a 7 foot grizzly bear charging towards him.	0
He ran as fast as he could up the path.	0
He looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was closing in on him.	0
He tried to run even faster, so scared that tears were coming to his eyes.	0
His heart was pumping frantically as he tried to run even faster, but he tripped and fell on the ground.	0
He rolled over to pick himself up and saw the bear right on top of him raising its paw to kill him.	0
At that instant he cried out Oh my God	0
And time stopped.	0
The bear froze.	0
The forest was silent.	0
The river even stopped flowing.	0
Very well said the voice.	0
And the light went out, the river flowed, the sounds of the forest continued, and the bear brought both paws together, bowed his head, and said, Lord, I thank you for this food which I am about to receive.	0
And have a great weekend.	0
Oh, and thanks to all of you who sent me happy birthday wishes.	0
It was very much appreciated.	0

I know you are extremely busy but I was just wondering if you found out about whether the 3 year period apllies to all options or just the ones in that program.	0

I enjoyed the discussion very much.	0
The DoD has significant challenges, but if the group participating in the meeting was any indication, they have some first rate people working on those challenges.	0
If I can be of further assistance, do not hesitate to call.	0
I believe that your remarks, along with those of Goran Lindahl, Dick Foster, and Phil Condit of Boeing, have caused a significant stir in the preparation for the congressionally mandated Quadrennial Defense Review and the Secretary's transformation planning.	0
I also can tell you that the feedback from participants regarding your briefing has been terrific.	0
We are reviewing all the material this week to begin the process of re-creating the session on the Secretary's webpage for the Forum, and I will be going over the video and audio clips for posting.	0
Recognizing that your slides were proprietary, it would be most valuable if we could post as much of your powerpoint briefing as possible--whatever you feel comfortable with sharing.	0
Whatever that turns out to be, if your staff could email that to me, I will make sure that only that, and not the original that you sent to me, gets posted.	1
I am not sure where the senior leadership of the DoD will be going in the coming months, however, I know that the discussion of your experience at Enron and the experiences of your panel mates will have an influence.	0
A more formal letter of thanks will be forthcoming, but for now, thank you again for joining us and helping to make this a memorable and most important Highlands Forum.	0

Keep up the good work.	0
In a nutshell, our strategy seems to have worked and we've won all the concessions we sought.	0
As you'll recall these were: a to get the BLM to withdraw any interim policies, the first of which split fiber cables into 144 different ROW certifications, and a later version that re-packaged the issue, mandating that ROW certificates be issued each time a fiber owner subleases or sells capacity on its line, with a retroactivity clause that added extra sting; b to get the Forest Service to retract its May 2nd memorandum which changed its fiber optic ROW policy from published fee schedules to individual comparable assessments the first such assessment, which compared ROW fees in urban centers in downtown Portland and Seattle to Oregon forest lands, increased the cost of a segment of our FTV fiber build 150 fold ; c to block both agencies from implementing any proposed or final rule in FY 2001; and d to create an open rule making process that involves all interested stakeholders, including Enron.	0
Thanks to the considerable pressure we orchestrated from Congress and the Administration, BLM Director Fry and USFS Chief Dombeck have backed away from points a and b above, and have agreed to points c and d. The language we inserted in the Interior Appropriations Bill, which has been agreed to by the Conferees, forces both agencies to revert back to the published fee schedules, prevents them from implementing any new policies in FY 2001, and forces them to work with industry and to come up with a common policy for future rent determination.	0
The reference in the opening sentence to gravitationally-challenged women is because the issue still hasn't quite closed.	0
The Interior Appropriations Bill may very well be vetoed.	0
But since our issue was settled at the staff level, and is now off the table, we're likely to remain safe from being re-examined and challenged.	1
In fact, any changes would likely only increase the strength of our hand: some members of our coalition are trying to insert even more detailed language in the report that prescribes exactly how the agencies will proceed to determine the new rental fee schedules over the next 18 months.	0
Through outside consultants, we've had a series of constructive discussions with the agencies over the past two weeks that have forged agreements on timing and specific ways forward.	0
Details are forthcoming, but Enron would be involved closely in the process.	0
The agencies were clearly surprised by the clout we wielded, and are now more than willing to negotiate.	0
But the bottom line, again, is that we have stopped both agencies from implementing their costly interim policies or launching a rule making process either now which they originally intended to do or in the coming fiscal year.	0
And by engaging key Members of Congress and the White House, and organizing and leading the 20-member Fiber Optic Public Land Right-of-Way Coalition, we've succeeded in branding Enron as a leader in the communications field.	0
Steve	0
A representative from the White House transition team joined the conversation.	0
I was asked the terms under which we were prepared to negotiate and I told them at a minimum upon a commitment by the Indian authorities to serious negotiations which would include full compliance with the terms of the contracts and progress in the reform of the MSEB.	0
I made clear that we do not see the Godbole Committee as the basis for such a discussion.	0
I think the USG wants to be on record politically encouraging the Indian Govt.	0
to engage in discussions all parties consider to be meaningful in hopes of working things out before it is too late, even while through OPIC and EXIM it is supporting the move towards PNT.	0
The administration may be concerned that without such a diplomatic overture on its part it could be concluded that the USG has politically taken a position on the project.	0
In Trakya, for example, the USG has been quite proactive in pressing the Turkish govt on the payments issue and even in discussing the payment concerns with the IMF so that the payments issues for the BOTs two of the four in Turkey are US sponsored are taken into account as the IMF program moves forward.	0
So I anticipate that the USG will shortly be meeting with the Indian ambassador here and the US Charge in Delhiwill likely be directed to make the rounds and meet with senior government officals on the project.	0
I wanted you to be aware of this; also any guidance you can provide would be helpful.	1

Because energy and telecom both have natural monopoly characteristics, the government gets involved in economic regulation not just the usual environment, safety, labor and other types of regulation which all businesses are subject to .	0
That means that there is constant interplay between policy makers and the business community and that policy makers have alot to say about which business strategies will be successful.	0
I plan a research emphasis in regulatory politics, specific to energy and telecom market convergence and the public interest.	0
I'd welcome any advice or suggestions you have regarding other potential area's of research, based on your professional experience in the public policy arena.	0

Amy is correct in the fact that EBS is not likely to buy the software Strategy that provides a strategic, top-down focus on competitive intelligence.	0
However, EBS is doing tactical competitive analysis and market research.	0
We are providing the business units with the information that they need to make intelligent decisions at the business unit level.	0
Amy's view is that competitive intelligence CI belongs at the corporate level and that CI should drive the strategic direction of the company.	0
You and I both know this is not the way Enron operates.	0

Another Stage 3 emergency and rolling blackouts Market power There are continued indications that the issue of market power will not be settled simply.	0
This week there was a lengthy and politically influential front page story in the New York Times about FERCs passive approach to policing generators Critics Say U.S. Energy Agency Is Weak in Oversight of Utilities .	0
The story was by Jeff Gerth and Joseph Kahn.	0
Jeff Gerth's 1992 story on the Whitewater deal is viewed by journalists to have been the origin of what eventually became a multi-year investigation of Bill Clinton.	0
See the discussion in the New York Times article on the good hours vs. bad hours approach and the associated political decision not to deal with good hours .	0
Can market power be used as leverage to eventually settle generator bills in California at something less than 100 cents on the dollar.	0
The California ISO filed a complaint claiming 6 billion in overcharges this week.	0
The QF irony Through the 1990s, QF contracts were projected to be the source of stranded costs because they were priced way above market.	0
In recent months, in California, they look like a bargain although some are not such great bargains because a portion of their price is tied to gas .	0
You would think that the utilities would request QFs to maximize their output.	0
But credit problems have created an ironical situation.	0
PG&E and Edison have not been paying the QFs fully and promptly for some time.	0
The QFs form a creditors committee and threaten to push PG&E and Edison into bankruptcy.	0
Some gas-fired QFs had to shut down because they did not have money to pay for the gas.	0
Last week's court decision allows MidAmerican/CalEnergy to essentially sell its power to others even though the QF contract dedicates the output to the purchasing utility.	0
CalEnergy does so immediately, selling to El Paso.	0
The Reliant Order A court ordered Reliant to continue to sell to the ISO, when requested, regardless of whether Reliant had been paid fully and promptly for past deliveries to the ISO.	0
Reliant announced it will appeal the order.	0
This is somewhat of a contrast to the QF situation except that the circumstances governing the 2 situations are probably different.	0
The QF contracts pre-date the ISO and are with the utilities and most likely make no reference to providing power during emergencies.	0
In fact, many QF contracts have the opposite provision: authority for the utility to cut takes during so-called light load periods.	0
with rolling blackouts this week.	0
This prompted everyone to wonder why this was happening in March.	0
Loss of about 3100 MW from QF plants that were forced to shutdown because they could not afford gas bills VV MARKET COMMENTARY For easier printing of all the articles in this section use the file at the end of the section Critics Say U.S. Energy Agency Is Weak in Oversight of Utilities By JEFF GERTH and JOSEPH KAHN 03/23/2001 The New York Times Page 1, Column 1 c. 2001 New York Times Company WASHINGTON, March 22 -- The pressure was intense when federal regulators met privately last month to debate remedies for soaring electricity prices in California.	0
Officials of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency whose mandate is to ensure ''just and reasonable'' electricity rates nationwide, had evidence that a few companies had been selling electricity to California at prices far above the cost of generating it.	0
The agency faced an imminent deadline to challenge those prices or let the companies possibly pocket hundreds of millions of dollars in unfair profits.	0
An internal memorandum laid out two choices.	0
The agency could audit and punish ''bad actors,'' the companies that were exploiting the market.	0
Or it could identify ''bad hours,'' when electricity shortages were most acute and spiking prices were arguably nobody's fault, and order refunds for only the most exorbitant prices.	0
It may be easier to identify bad hours than bad actors,'' the memorandum said.	0
The commission took the easier way.	0
It decided not to investigate reports of abuses by companies, but issued an order that could require them to refund to the state utilities up to 124 million collected during a relatively few ''bad hours'' in January and February.	0
That is hundreds of millions of dollars less than California might have claimed, since the most potential overcharging occurred during ''good hours,'' when power was more plentiful but prices were often just as extreme.	0
The order ignored those hours.	0
Today, in a criticism of the agency's lack of aggressiveness, California regulators estimated that generators had charged 6.2 billion above competitive levels over 10 months.	0
They urged the agency to dig deeper, hoping it would demand more refunds or other stiff remedies.	0
But the agency's track record -- one of complacency in the eyes of state officials -- leaves California regulators skeptical that Washington will confront the big power producers.	0
The small, obscure agency, tucked behind the rail yard of Union Station here, has largely soft-pedaled its role as the electricity industry's top cop, even though it has wide authority to keep power companies in line.	0
To keep rates reasonable, it can impose price caps, strip companies of the right to charge market rates, force them to return excessive profits and even suspend deregulation altogether.	0
Instead, the agency has largely left it to private companies to pry open the 250 billion electricity industry, which has historically been controlled by monopoly utilities and state officials.	0
The agency's defenders, including its chairman, Curt Hebert Jr., a fierce advocate of unfettered markets, say that its largely hands-off approach reflects the delicate balancing of competing interests -- a commitment to protect consumers while not stifling market forces.	0
But politicians, utility executives, energy economists and local regulators say California's rolling blackouts and skyrocketing electricity prices are the signs of a market running amok.	0
They accuse the agency of standing aside as companies manipulate their way to windfall profits.	0
The agency's critics, who include one of its own commissioners and numerous staff members, say that its enforcement mission has been blunted by free-market passions and the influence of industry insiders in its ranks.	0
When the agency began its first national investigation of high electricity prices last year, it named a newly recruited industry insider, Scott Miller, to lead the effort.	0
Mr. Miller and his colleagues said in their report that there was ''insufficient data'' in California to prove any profiteering by generating companies.	0
Yet his own former employer, PG&E Energy Trading, was at the time a subject of a civil antitrust investigation by the Justice Department that focused on electricity market abuses in New England.	0
The agency has given state regulators a lead role in monitoring local power markets.	0
Yet even as these regulators have urged the agency to be more aggressive in investigating suspicions that companies have abused their power in California, New England, the Midwest and the mid-Atlantic, they have frequently been ignored or rebuffed.	0
Critics say that the agency began deregulation before it was ready or willing to make sure the markets worked effectively.	0
They accuse it of showing favoritism to industry -- allowing companies, for example, to ignore requirements to file detailed reports of market transactions that are critical to proving accusations of market abuses.	0
We need to wake up to the fact that this is a dysfunctional market that is being gamed and manipulated by those who participate in it,'' said William Massey, a commissioner of the agency who has become one of its leading critics.	0
The agency's inaction, the critics say, leads to ''gaming'' -- jockeying for profits that does not necessarily involve illegality -- and outright market manipulation.	0
Consumers and utilities are the victims, paying billions of dollars more for electricity than if the markets were truly competitive.	0
Agency officials acknowledge that enforcement of market rules to curb gaming and manipulation had not been a high priority in previous years.	0
But they defended their recent California order as proof that they intend to keep markets free of abuse.	0
They add that the agency is also pressuring two generators to refund almost 11 million for possibly manipulating the California market last spring.	0
Agency officials and some outside analysts say that poorly conceived deregulation plans by states, a shortage of power plants, rising natural gas prices, and even the weather have had more impact on electricity prices than abuses by companies or any failings by the agency.	0
They say the agency must balance the competing interests of generators, local regulators and utility companies if it is to keep deregulation on track.	0
We're trying to craft a system that gives breathing room to develop a market, but not so much room that undue market power punishes consumers,'' Mr. Hebert said.	0
Fight Over Deregulation Today's debate traces back to the 1930's, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt backed legislation to break up utility monopolies.	0
The Federal Power Act of 1935 gave the Federal Power Commission a mandate to ensure ''just and reasonable'' electricity rates.	0
The Federal Power Commission was abolished in 1977 and replaced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, an independent agency with 1,200 employees that also oversees oil pipelines and the natural gas market.	0
The president appoints the chairman and four commissioners -- two Democrats and two Republicans with staggered terms of five years.	0
Two Republican seats are currently unfilled.	0
The deregulation of the electricity markets began in the late 1980's, after the agency had begun opening the gas markets.	0
By 1996, the commissioners issued a landmark order that forced utility companies to open their transmission lines to other utilities and electricity wholesalers.	0
The commission and many private economists expected that by prying open protected markets, electricity prices would immediately fall.	0
That possibility set off a deregulation frenzy, most prominently in California, New York, New England and the mid-Atlantic states.	0
Generating companies rushed to expand in the new, borderless market.	0
But the agency's balancing act has grown more difficult as electricity deregulation has spread nationwide.	0
Congress has forced it to trim its staff in recent years.	0
Officials complain that investigating abuses in electricity markets strains their resources.	0
And as the California crisis has worsened, the commissioners have begun sparring publicly among themselves about what to do.	0
This week, Mr. Massey, a Democratic commissioner, and Mr. Hebert pronounced AY-bear , a Republican, sat side by side before a House panel and argued diametrically opposed positions.	0
Mr. Hebert said high prices in California ''were sending the right signals to get supply there.''	0
Mr. Massey called the prices that generators were charging ''unlawful'' and said that his agency, by not reining them in, ''is simply not doing its job.''	0
The agency's leadership has been in flux for months.	0
Congressional and industry officials in Washington say President Bush is considering replacing Mr. Hebert, whom he named to the top post less than two months ago, with Pat Wood, who runs the Texas public utility commission.	0
A White House spokeswoman had no comment on the reports.	0
Though Mr. Hebert's positions are not far from those of the Bush administration, his relations with California leaders may have made his position tenuous.	0
Mr. Hebert, a Mississippian who is a close ally of the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, has warred with California politicians who have proposed new solutions to the crisis there.	0
Mr. Hebert, who has served as a commissioner since 1997, has often taken the most ideologically free-market position of any commissioner.	0
He flatly rejects the idea of price caps on electricity as hopelessly ineffective and contrary to market forces.	0
When Gov.	0
Gray Davis outlined a plan to have the state buy transmission lines to relieve utility companies' debt, Mr. Hebert's response was dismissive.	0
It's not in the interest of the American public,'' he pronounced.	0
Even as new electricity markets opened in the summer of 1999, they started producing nasty shocks.	0
The mid-Atlantic region experienced some early volatility.	0
As the turmoil grew, economists began raising the alarm about a phenomenon called ''market power,'' the ability of energy traders in the new national market to sustain prices above the competitive level.	0
Proving such abuses is difficult, because it requires comparing tens of thousands of separate electricity transactions with the costs of the generators that initiated them.	0
Joseph Bowring, who heads the market monitoring unit of the nonprofit entity that operates the mid-Atlantic transmission system, said that power companies there had exercised some market power.	0
But only the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, not local regulators, had the authority to collect the data to determine how much market power had been exercised and whether it had been abusive or not, he said.	0
Mr. Bowring said he talked to agency officials about doing so.	0
In the end, Mr. Bowring and several agency officials said, the agency chose not to investigate.	0
The decision roiled some agency officials.	0
Ron Rattey, a veteran agency economist, wrote a memorandum last June describing the staff as ''impotent in our ability to monitor, foster, and ensure competitive electric power markets.''	0
The staff, the memorandum said, did not even enforce a requirement that power companies file detailed quarterly reports listing essentially every sale they make.	0
Such data would have been useful to Mr. Bowring.	0
Local-Federal Clash Local regulators who want to ensure competitive prices often have to act on their own.	0
Monitors in New England have intervened about 600 times since 1999 to correct prices they determined had been caused, at least in part, by market manipulation.	0
The federal agency has sometimes chastised them for interfering too much.	0
The industry, not surprisingly, shares that view.	0
One vocal critic was Mr. Miller.	0
Before the agency recruited him last July to head its division of energy markets, he was director of policy coordination for the national energy-trading unit of PG&E Corporation, the California holding company whose assets also include Pacific Gas and Electric, the California utility.	0
Although the utility has lost billions of dollars during California's crisis, Mr. Miller's former unit has become one of the most profitable new energy traders nationwide.	0
PG&E Energy Trading, by several estimates, is now the second-largest seller of electricity in New England.	0
The company has had a rocky relationship with regulators.	0
They intervened several times in 1999 and 2000 to retroactively cancel auctions they said produced excessive profits for PG&E and other companies.	0
Mr. Miller denounced the practice, though he acknowledged in public testimony that his company sometimes charged ''very high'' prices when it could.	0
One person's predatory pricing is another person's competitive advantage,'' Mr. Miller said at a public hearing on deregulation in Texas in 1999.	0
New England regulators too often acted as ''judge, jury and executioner'' when overseeing the market, he said.	0
One year later, Mr. Miller and his new colleagues at the federal agency got a chance to examine New England's problems from the regulators' perspective.	0
Their Nov. 1 report attributed New England's frequent price gyrations to technical and regulatory flaws.	0
As Mr. Miller's team was preparing its report, the Justice Department, whose threshold for stepping into possible industry wrongdoing is far higher than the agency's, began looking into whether price spikes in New England pointed to unlawful monopoly power or collusion, people contacted by the department during that inquiry said.	0
One subject of the civil inquiry is possible price manipulation in one of New England's ancillary services markets, people contacted by the department said.	0
They said the department was examining whether PG&E and two other companies tried to corner that market for several months early last year.	0
PG&E confirmed that the Justice Department had contacted it, but denies wrongdoing and says it has cooperated with the department's requests.	0
Mr. Miller has declined to comment on his role at PG&E or at the agency.	0
His supervisors defended his work and said they had detected no conflict of interest between his work at PG&E and his duties at the agency.	0
Those duties brought Mr. Miller to California last August.	0
With electricity prices there soaring, he and his colleagues sat down with several utility executives at the agency's San Francisco office.	0
One executive, Gary Stern, director of market monitoring for Southern California Edison, wanted the agency to stop what he suspected were market abuses by power generators.	0
He provided a road map to help investigators figure out how power companies traded power contracts -- and whether they had manipulated the markets.	0
But when Mr. Miller and his team approached 11 generators and marketers -- including his old employer -- a few weeks later, they did it their way.	0
They asked eight questions, many of them imprecise, like: ''Describe your strategy for bidding generation resources into market.''	0
This question, Mr. Stern said in a recent interview, ''was equivalent to asking a suspected burglar how he spent his day.''	0
Some agency officials also thought the team should probe deeper.	0
Mr. Rattey recommended that Mr. Miller seek the quarterly pricing reports that marketers were supposed to file.	0
But his suggestion was not adopted, agency records show.	0
Daniel Larcamp, Mr. Miller's supervisor, said ''there might have been more information that could have been obtained'' in the California inquiry.	0
But he said the commission gave the staff only three months to finish, making it impossible to collect and analyze the reams of data involved.	0
For Mr. Miller, agency documents show, the investigation was so time-consuming that he had no time to fill out the financial disclosure form required of new federal employees.	0
Mr. Miller submitted his form in late January, after a reporter requested it.	0
Agency lawyers approved the form, but only after he provided additional information about his job and compensation from PG&E.	0
The lawyers said Mr. Miller's participation had been permissible because PG&E was not the subject of the investigation.	0
When the staff report was issued on Nov. 1, it found high prices and problems in the design of the California market.	0
But while the companies ''had the potential to exercise market power,'' the commission said, there was ''insufficient data'' to prove that they did.	0
Some marketers saw the report as an exoneration.	0
This has been looked at several times, most notably by the FERC and nobody has found any evidence of market manipulation and profiteering,'' Rob Doty, the chief financial officer of Dynegy Inc., told a reporter earlier this year.	0
California Inquiry The agency has recently shown signs of wanting to apply pressure on generators.	0
But its early efforts show how it is treading on new and uncertain turf.	0
When the California crisis grew severe last December, the commission issued a refund order, a shot across the bow for generators charging high prices.	0
It required them to submit detailed data any time they sold electricity in California for more than 150 per megawatt hour, considered at the time a fair estimate of the highest costs any of them faced.	0
It also told generators that for the next several months, they could be forced to give refunds if the agency found that they had charged excessive prices.	0
The commission also said that it would examine bidding practices and strategies for withholding generating capacity to ferret out any efforts to artificially raise prices.	0
When the agency's own 60-day deadline for examining market data in January approached, however, it became clear that staff members had not made any detailed examination.	0
Instead, staff members said, the agency scrambled to forge a last-minute compromise that would allow it to issue a statement opposing high prices in the state without a time-consuming investigation.	0
During this scramble, a senior staff member, Kevin Kelly, suggested focusing on bad hours instead of bad actors.	0
Our attempts to find illegal behavior or legal 'misbehavior' by sellers 'bad actors' always seems to fail,'' his memorandum said.	0
It said that the agency could more easily blame high prices on acute shortages during the most critical hours.	0
The suggestion won the day.	0
The commission decided to limit its order to the hours when California declared a Stage 3 emergency, when supplies are critically low.	0
Mr. Stern of Southern California Edison and several private-sector economists have attacked the economic logic of that order.	0
They said that the commission has focused on times when prices might be legitimately high.	0
The bigger worry: Generators can and often do sustain artificially high prices when supplies are not as tight, they say.	0
Mr. Massey, the Democratic commissioner, dissented from the decision for those reasons.	0
Because most high-priced transactions in January and February did not occur during bad hours, he argued, the commission effectively chose to bless as ''just and reasonable'' the hefty profits generators are making from the California crisis.	0
The problem with my agency is that we're so carried away with the rhetoric of markets that we've gotten sloppy,'' Mr. Massey said.	0
We're talking about electricity.	0
It's the juice of the economy, so it's got to be available and reasonably priced.''	0
Williams defends pricing of electricity 03/23/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001.	0

TULSA, Okla. AP - Williams Cos. Inc. says it can justify the rates it charged for wholesale power, despite accusations from federal regulators that it sold over-priced electricity to California.	0
Federal regulators claim Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co., a unit of Tulsa-based Williams, owes California more than 40 million in refunds for power it sold to the state's Independent System Operator.	0
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission says that Williams is one of several power providers responsible for 124 million in overcharges from transactions in January and February.	0
The Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid, claims the state was overcharged 6.2 billion by 21 wholesale power providers, including Williams, between May and February.	0
Williams says the rates it charged California were fair and were based on production costs and market conditions.	0
Williams is confident that it performed within the guidelines established by the ISO, said Williams spokeswoman Paula Hall Collins.	0
We felt like we had worked within the regulations set up by ISO.	0
According to the commission, power prices levied by Williams in January and February exceeded federal price ceilings based on the cost of natural gas and other market conditions.	0
However, the price ceilings were established after the ISO accepted Williams' power prices, Collins said.	0
The commission will review Williams' explanation and either accept the justification or order the company to pay refunds.	0
Allegheny Energy makes big California connection 03/23/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001.	0
HAGERSTOWN, Md.	0
AP - Allegheny Energy Inc. said Thursday it has agreed to sell 4.5 billion worth of power to California's electricity-purchasing agency over the next 10 years.	0
The company said the contract call for Allegheny to provide up to 1,000 megawatts that the Hagerstown-based company has secured from western generating plants through its new energy trading division, Allegheny Energy Global Markets - formerly Merrill Lynch Global Energy Markets.	0
This is a win-win for both the state of California and Allegheny Energy.	0
It provides a long-term source of fixed-price energy and should help to stabilize prices in California, said Michael P. Morrell, president of the Allegheny Energy Supply division.	0
Allegheny Energy is the parent of Allegheny Power, which delivers electric energy and natural gas to parts of Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia.	0
Williams plans expansion of pipeline to help power Calif. 03/23/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001.	0
SALT LAKE CITY AP - The Williams Cos. plans to expands its Kern River pipeline, which runs through Utah, to provide more natural gas for generating plants in California.	0
Williams' gas pipeline unit in Salt Lake City said Thursday that it plans to construct nearly 700 miles of additional pipeline that will run parallel to its existing Kern River line.	0
Construction on the 1 billion project is expected to begin next year and is scheduled for completion in May 2003, said Kirk Morgan, director of business development for Kern River pipeline.	0
Shippers are seeking more access to natural gas from the Rocky Mountain basin, where producers are aggressively stepping up production, Morgan said.	0
The new pipeline is expected to deliver about 900 million cubic feet of natural gas per day to markets in Utah, Nevada and California.	0
Most of the gas will be used for generating plants planned in California.	0
If all of the pipeline's capacity were used to generate electricity, it could produce about 5,400 megawatts.	0
That is enough to light around 4.5 million homes, Morgan said.	0
The original Kern River line was completed in 1992.	0
It enters Utah from Wyoming then crosses into the Salt Lake Valley near Bountiful.	0
It turns south near the Salt Lake City International Airport then runs the length of the state before passing into southern Nevada and winding up near Bakersfield, Calif.	0
It currently transports 700 million cubic feet of natural gas per day.	0
Williams, based in Tulsa, Okla., recently filed an emergency application with federal regulators to install additional pumping stations on the line to increase its capacity by 135 million cubic feet per day.	0
That 81 million pumping station project should be completed by July 1.	0
During the 2002 construction period, the Kern River project will employ between 1,500 and 1,800 people.	0
The company estimates annual property taxes it pays to Utah counties will increase from 3.5 million to about 7 million.	0
Questar will be one of the customers on the new pipeline, Morgan said.	0
The utility wants to supply additional gas to southern Utah cities, including St. George and Cedar City.	0
Our own pipelines serving southern Utah are at full capacity so this is an opportunity to transport additional gas into those areas from company-owned supplies in Wyoming, said Questar Gas spokeswoman Audra Sorensen.	0
Calif Energy Commission OKs 3 Pwr Plants Worth 2,076 MW 03/23/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. This article was originally published Thursday LOS ANGELES - Dow Jones - The California Energy Commission Wednesday approved three power plants worth 2,076 megawatts, two of which are scheduled to come on line by the end of 2002, a CEC spokesman said Thursday.	0
The plants approved include BP Amoco PLC BP unit ARCO Western Energy's 500 megawatt Western Midway Sunset Project, slated to come on line in October 2002; Caithness Energy's 520 MW Blythe Power Plant, to come on line by Dec. 31, 2002; and Thermo Ecotek's 1,056 MW Mountainview Power Plant, scheduled to come on line in April 2003.	0
All three of the new plants will be natural gas-fired combined-cycle plants.	0
The 550 million Mountainview plant will be located in Southern California, near San Bernadino.	0
The 300 million Western Midway-Sunset plant will be located in central Kern County, while the 250 million Blythe plant will be located in the city of Blythe in Riverside County.	0
The latest approvals bring to 13 the total number of plants approved since April 1999 by the CEC, a spokesman said.	0
Those plants will supply 8,405 MW to the state, which has seen rolling blackouts and spiking wholesale power prices in the last six months, in part due to lack of supply.	0
-By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872; jessica.berthold@dowjones.com Some CalEnergy Power Could Be Sold Outside Calif - CEO 03/23/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. This article was originally published Thursday LOS ANGELES - Dow Jones - Some of CalEnergy Operating Corp's power could end up being sold outside of California, though that is not the company's intent, CalEnergy Chairman and CEO David Sokol said in a conference call Thursday.	0
CalEnergy, an affiliate of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co, which is majority owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire-Hathaway BRKA , was given legal authority Thursday to suspend 270 megawatts of power delivery to Edison International EIX utility Southern California Edison and sell on the open market, because SoCal Edison has not paid its bills since November.	0
CalEnergy stopped supplying power to SoCal Ed immediately following the court ruling.	0
We stopped supplying power at 1 PM PST and have been selling to parties that will pay since then....We are selling it to marketers; our current marketing agent is El Paso Corp EPG and they will sell it for us, Sokol said.	0
Sokol added that while it was his company's intention to have its power sold to California, that could not be guaranteed.	0
We leave the energy selling to El Paso....We've directed them that we would like the power to stay in California but we can't stop them, from selling out of state, Sokol said.	0
Wholesale prices on the open market are about 400- 500 a megawatt-hour, three times more than what the company had received under its contract with SoCal Ed.	0
The court's ruling did not address the 45 million SoCal Ed still owes CalEnergy for November and December power, and Sokol said that his company's separate lawsuit on that matter sought to attach the utility's assets as payment for that debt.	0
Sokol said the court's ruling had significant implications for the entire community of small, independent generators, known as qualifying facilities or QFs, who have not received payment from SoCal Ed.	0
Edison's own lawyer said it best....that every QF in the state will begin to mitigate if the judge allowed us to sell on the open market , Sokol said.	0
Sokol said his company was prepared to push SoCal Ed into involuntary bankruptcy Friday if CalEnergy hadn't won the case, but said he couldn't speculate whether other QFs may be more or less inclined to do so as a result of the court outcome.	0
A group of renewable power suppliers, owed more than 100 million from SoCal Ed, said late Wednesday they want state lawmakers to release them for their supply contracts with PG&E Corp. PCG unit Pacific Gas & Electric and SoCal Ed until the utilities are restored to financial stability.	0
The utilities claim close to 13 billion in undercollections due to an inability to pass high wholesale power costs to customers under a rate freeze.	0
In a statement, SoCal Ed said it opposed CalEnergy's bid to suspend its QF contract because the utility believed Gov.	0
Gray Davis and state regulators are close to resolving very legitimate financial concerns of CalEnergy and other QF suppliers.	0
SoCal Ed said it was concerned that CalEnergy's request to sell to third parties would lead to a major supply shortage in California.	0
The utility said it has informed the QFs that it is working to resolve the issue without giving unfair advantage to one class of creditors.	0
While many of the state's large power suppliers have been paid by on a forward basis for the power they sell into California, the QFs, which make up one-third of the state's total power supply, haven't been paid by SoCal Ed since November.	0
PG&E has made partial payments to its QFs.	0

California and the West Judge Frees Small Firm From Edison Contract KEN ELLINGWOOD; DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITERS 03/23/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition A-3 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company El CENTRO -- California's balance of electrical power shifted slightly Thursday when an Imperial County judge temporarily freed a small geothermal energy producer from its contract with Southern California Edison, allowing it to sell power on the open market.	0
The ruling by Superior Court Judge Donal B. Donnelly could lead to a mass exodus by hundreds of small energy producers that have been selling power to the state's financially troubled utilities for months without getting paid.	0
At the same time, it may have staved off plans by a group of the small generators to send Edison into involuntary bankruptcy as early as today.	0
In Sacramento, energy legislation pushed by Gov.	0
Gray Davis passed in the state Senate but foundered in the Assembly.	0
The measure was intended to ensure that the state gets repaid for the electricity that it has been buying on behalf of Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric, which say they lack the cash and credit to purchase power.	0
The bill also was supposed to guarantee that the small, alternative energy producers--which together provide nearly a third of the state's power--get paid.	0
But Assembly Republicans opposed it, saying it hadn't been given sufficient scrutiny.	0
The impact of the small producers was made clear in Imperial County, where Edison's failure to pay CalEnergy, the county's biggest property taxpayer, had outsize implications.	0
CalEnergy had put county officials on notice that it was about to miss a 3.8-million property tax payment.	0
The uncertainty had prompted the tiny Calipatria Unified School District to postpone a bond issue for badly needed school repairs.	0
Among CalEnergy Chairman David Sokol's first acts after the judge's ruling Thursday was to promise Imperial County Supervisor Wally J. Leimgruber that the company would pay its property taxes on time.	0
That is great news, Leimgruber said.	0
Within hours of its court victory, CalEnergy had stopped transmitting geothermal power to Edison and begun selling it to El Paso Energy, a marketing company that purchased the energy at prevailing rates and resold it on the spot market.	0
Some of the more than 700 other small energy producers in the state said they were considering similar action against Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric.	0
We absolutely need the right to sell to third parties, said Dean Vanech, president of Delta Power, a New Jersey company that owns five small gas-fired plants in California and is owed tens of millions of dollars by Edison.	0
Sokol praised the Imperial County judge and said his company simply wanted the authority to sell its power to a credit-worthy company that, in fact, pays for the power.	0
An Edison spokesman said the company was disappointed with the ruling, but sympathized with CalEnergy and other small producers because California's power crisis has placed them in financial distress, just as it has placed utilities in financial distress.	0
Edison expressed concern that the ruling would prompt CalEnergy and other small producers to sell their power out of state.	0
Sokol said CalEnergy had specifically told El Paso Energy that it hoped its power would remain in California, but if someone wants to pay a higher price out of state, we can't stop them.	0
Sokol said that Edison still owes CalEnergy 140 million and that the company--along with seven other small producers--had been prepared to file a petition in federal bankruptcy court in Los Angeles today forcing the utility into involuntary bankruptcy.	0
He said his company no longer intends to do so, and he believed--but wasn't certain--that the other companies would shelve their plans.	0
Edison filed papers Thursday with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission showing that it owed 840 million to various small electricity producers, many of which rely on renewable energy sources such as geothermal steam, solar energy or wind.	0
The alternative energy producers--and utilities--strenuously objected to the legislation considered in Sacramento on Thursday.	0
The bill, spelling out how the utilities are to pay the state and the small producers, passed the Senate on a 27-9 vote, the exact two-thirds margin required.	0
But it stalled in the Assembly on a 46-23 party-line vote, well short of two-thirds.	0
When I was a citizen back in Lancaster, I heard these stories about pieces of legislation that were cooked up late at night, that .	0
were cut and pasted together and were rammed through by the Legislature, Assemblyman George Runner R-Lancaster said.	0
That's exactly what we have before us.	0
The alternative electricity generators, including oil companies, warned that they would lose money under the Davis proposal, while representatives of Edison and PG&E, which have amassed billions in debt in the worsening energy crisis, said the legislation would push them deeper into the hole.	0
There isn't enough money, Edison attorney Ann Cohn testified at a Senate hearing on the bill Thursday.	0
It is a very simple question: Dollars going out cannot be greater than dollars coming in.	0
The bill, AB 8X, combined several proposals.	0
First, it sought to clarify earlier legislation by spelling out that Edison and PG&E must pay the state all money collected from consumers for electricity that the state has been buying.	0
Additionally, the bill would turn over to the California Public Utilities Commission the thorny issue of how much to pay alternative energy producers for their electricity.	0
Wind, solar and geothermal producers might agree to the prices offered by the administration.	0
But most of the alternative energy producers, including Chevron and British Petroleum, use natural gas to generate electricity through cogeneration, a process of creating steam for both electric generation and heat.	0
With natural gas prices high, they contend, they would lose money at the prices Davis is offering.	0

BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC Power Points Background The state Legislature approved electricity deregulation with a unanimous vote in 199	0
The move was expected to lower power bills in California by opening up the energy market to competition.	0
Relatively few companies, however, entered that market to sell electricity, giving each that did considerable influence over the price.	0
Meanwhile, demand has increased in recent years while no major power plants have been built.	0
These factors combined last year to push up the wholesale cost of electricity.	0
But the state's biggest utilities--Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison--are barred from increasing consumer rates.	0
So the utilities have accumulated billions of dollars in debt and, despite help from the state, have struggled to buy enough electricity.	0
* Daily Developments * Overcharges by major electricity suppliers were estimated at 6.3 billion, up from the 5.5 billion first thought, California's power grid operator said.	0
* Electricity producers denied that they have profiteered and argued that Cal-ISO's figures don't take into account all their costs.	0
* A Superior Court judge's ruling Thursday freeing a small producer from its contract with Edison could lead to a mass exodus by small energy producers that have been selling to the utilities without getting paid.	0
Meanwhile, a California state judge handed down a decision involving small power producers that could result in more electricity being made available in the energy-starved state, but likely at greater cost to the state government.	0
The 6.2 billion figure was contained in a market analysis by the California Independent System Operator filed yesterday with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.	0
The ISO says it isn't seeking a refund -- for the May through February period -- because its analysis lacked important market data.	0
For example, it estimated costs for 21 suppliers based on published prices for natural gas, not on specific data showing what each generator actually paid for the fuel.	0
We don't know how much gas actually was purchased at spot-market prices, said Anjali Sheffrin, the ISO's head of market analysis.	0
Charles Robinson, general counsel for the ISO, said FERC needs to become more aggressive about market-power mitigation.	0
The ISO's filing, he said, was intended to push the agency in that direction, since FERC is responsible for policing deregulated electricity and natural-gas markets.	0
He said that if the FERC doesn't act, the state of California may find ways to discipline the market, such as through the state attorney general's office.	0
The attorney general has been investigating the state's electricity market for many months but hasn't brought any court action.	0
Dynegy Inc., a big owner of power plants in California, said it will provide additional information to FERC supporting its position that the prices it has charged for power have been just and reasonable.	0
The Houston company was one of 13 energy suppliers that the FERC this month ordered to pay refunds totaling 124 million or show cause why it should be excused.	0
Dynegy said the FERC analysis was flawed, because it used inaccurate prices for natural gas and pollution credits.	0
While big power producers such as Dynegy came under attack, small power producers won a potentially significant victory in a state court in Southern California's Imperial County.	0
A judge granted 10 geothermal plants operated by the CalEnergy Co. unit of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co., a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., of Omaha, Neb., permission to suspend deliveries of electricity to Southern California Edison Co. and instead seek other buyers.	0
These plants, known as qualifying facilities, are under long-term contract to Edison and other utilities but haven't been paid for months.	0
Edison, a unit of Edison International, of Rosemead, Calif., says it has been unable to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in power bills to CalEnergy and others because it has been driven to the brink of insolvency by the state's failed utility-deregulation plan.	0
While the CalEnergy case involves only about 320 megawatts of power, the repercussions could be far greater.	0
Collectively, hundreds of qualifying facilities, or QFs, produce as much as 30% of California's electricity needs.	0
QFs totaling 3,000 megawatts cut their production in recent weeks for lack of payment.	0
This loss of output was a significant cause of the blackouts that hit California this week.	0
Observers believe the CalEnergy court decision could give other QFs an opportunity to sell power in the open market, presumably to the state government that now is California's biggest energy buyer.	0
An hour after the court decision yesterday, some 400 megawatts of power came back into the market, the ISO said.	0
However, additional QF power sales on the open market could substantially increase the state's tab.	0
Already, the state has allocated more than 4 billion for electricity purchases.	0
Separately, Edison said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that its unpaid power bills could contribute to a write-off of as much as 2.7 billion for 2000.	0
Because of uncertainty caused by the energy crisis, the company hasn't yet reported year-end earnings.	0
Power regulators debate who should be exempted from blackouts By KAREN GAUDETTE Associated Press Writer 03/22/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001.	0
SAN FRANCISCO AP - State power regulators said Thursday they are working to exempt all California hospitals, regardless of size, from rolling blackouts.	0
The Public Utilities Commission met with representatives from hospitals and investor-owned utilities after Los Angeles lawyer David Huard filed an emergency motion with the PUC on behalf of more than 500 hospitals throughout the state.	0
Under PUC rules, hospitals with more than 100 beds are exempt from losing electricity during power emergencies.	0
But during rolling blackouts Monday, at least a dozen hospitals from Long Beach to Clearlake were forced to use their backup generators.	0
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison Co. say they blacked out those hospitals specifically because they have backup generators.	0
Both utilities said the temporary blackouts were part of their overall efforts to spread the burden of blackouts over more of their customers.	0
Linda Ziegler, director of business and regulatory planning for SoCal Edison, said the utility is following state law and will implement new guidelines if the PUC changes them.	0
But hospitals say there is a 10-second lapse before emergency generators kick in, which could harm patients in the midst of delicate surgical procedures such as organ transplants or brain surgery.	0
You wouldn't fly a plane with only your emergency backup systems in place, said Ann Mosher, a spokeswoman for California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco.	0
Backup generators are just that, they're not designed to keep the hospital up and running at full capacity.	0
Ziegler said that power still goes out for reasons beyond the energy crisis, from incidents like lightning or a knocked-down power pole.	0
If it's a serious problem for the hospital it's certainly something they should be address just from an ongoing basis, she said.	0
The exemption would cover all hospitals within the territory of the state's investor owned utilities PG&E, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric.	0
Hospitals within the range of municipally owned utilities, such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, are separately regulated.	0
For more than two decades, prisons, hospitals with more than 100 beds and emergency services such as fire and police departments have been classified as essential services, and are exempted from blackouts by order of state power regulators.	0
After rolling blackouts began darkening the state in January, many other public service groups began seeking relief from power interruptions, including transit systems, schools and water districts.	0
U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. said Californians were at risk of irreparable harm if Reliant Energy REI stopped selling power to the Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power grid.	0
The ISO buys last-minute power on behalf of utilities to fill gaps in supply.	0
Damrell dismissed Reliant's attempt to force the state Department of Water Resources to back the ISO's purchases for the state's two biggest utilities.	0
The state has been spending about 50 million a day on power for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, both denied credit by suppliers after amassing billions of dollars in debts.	0
The judge said he had no authority to force the DWR to pay for that power.	0
Gov.	0
Gray Davis has said the state isn't responsible for purchasing the costly last-minute power ISO buys for Edison and PG&E, despite a law authorizing state power purchases on the utilities' behalf.	0
ISO attorney Charles Robinson said the ruling gives ISO operators a tool to assist them in keeping the lights on in California.	0
Had the decision gone the other way, one could expect other generators to simply ignore emergency orders, Robinson said.	0
Damrell's preliminary injunction will remain in effect until the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rules on the matter.	0
Damrell denied the ISO's request for preliminary injunctions against three other wholesalers - Dynegy Inc. DYN , AES Corp. AES and Williams Cos. WMB - which agreed to continue selling to the ISO pending the FERC ruling.	0
Spokesmen for Reliant, Dynegy, AES and Williams were out of the office Wednesday night and didn't immediately return calls from The Associated Press seeking comment on the ruling.	0
The ISO went to court in February after a federal emergency order requiring the power sales expired.	0
The judge then issued a temporary restraining order, requiring the sales, but dropped it after the suppliers agreed to continue sales to California pending his Wednesday ruling.	0
The ISO said it would lose about 3,600 megawatts if the suppliers pulled out, enough power for about 2.7 million households.	0
One megawatt is enough for roughly 750 homes.	0
Grid officials said Reliant's share alone is about 3,000 megawatts.	0
Reliant said the amount at issue actually is less than a fourth of that, because most of its output is already committed under long-term contracts.	0
Reliant, which currently provides about 9% of the state's power, worries it won't get paid due to the financial troubles of PG&E and Edison.	0
PG&E and Edison say that together they have lost about 13 billion since June due to soaring wholesale electricity costs that California's 1996 deregulation law bars them from passing onto customers.	0
Calif Small Pwr Producers To Shut Plants If Rates Capped By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 03/22/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. LOS ANGELES - Dow Jones - Many of California's independent power producers late Wednesday threatened to take their small power plants offline this week if state lawmakers pass legislation that would cap the rates the generators charge for electricity they sell directly to the state's three investor-owned utilities.	0
At issue is a bill that would repeal a section of the state's Public Utilities Code, which links the 688 so-called qualifying facilities' electricity rates to the monthly border price of natural gas.	0
Lawmakers, however, are poised to pass the legislation.	0
State regulators are then expected to approve a measure that would restructure the fluctuating rates the QFs charge PG&E Corp. PCG unit Pacific Gas & Electric, Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison, and Sempra Energy SRE unit San Diego Gas & Electric from 170 a megawatt-hour to 69- 79/MWh, regardless of the price of natural gas.	0
Whereas each of the 688 QF contracts differed, largely because natural gas prices are higher in Southern California than Northern California, the state wants the QFs to sign a general contract with the utilities.	0
The cogeneration facilities, which produce about 5,400 megawatts of electricity in the state, said the rates are too low and they won't sign new supply contracts with the utilities.	0
For 79/MWh, natural gas would have to be 6 per million British thermal unit at the Southern California border, said Tom Lu, executive director of Carson-based Watson Cogeneration Company, the state's largest QF, generating 340 MW.	0
Our current gas price at the border is 12.50.	0
Other gas-fired QFs said the state could face another round of rolling blackouts if lawmakers and state regulators pass the legislation, which is expected to be heard on the Senate floor Thursday, and allow it to be implemented by Public Utilities Commission next week.	0
Lu, whose company is half-owned by BP Amoco PLC BP and is owed 100 million by SoCal Ed, said the proposals by the PUC and the Legislature will only make things worse.	0
David Fogarty, spokesman for Western States Petroleum Association, whose members supply California with more than 2,000 MW, said the utilities need to pay the QFs more than 1 billion for electricity that was already produced.	0
State Loses 3,000 MW QF Output Due Of Financial Reasons The QFs represent about one-third, or 9,700 MW, of the state's total power supply.	0
Roughly 5,400 MW are produced by natural gas-fired facilities.	0
The rest is generated by wind, solar power and biomass.	0
About 3,000 MW of gas-fired and renewable QF generation is offline in California because the power plant owners haven't been paid hundreds of millions of dollars from cash-strapped utilities SoCal Ed and PG&E for nearly four months.	0
Several small power plant owners owed money by SoCal Ed have threatened to drag the utility into involuntary bankruptcy if the utility continues to default on payments and fails to agree to supply contracts at higher rates.	0
The defaults have left many of the renewable and gas-fired QFs unable to operate their power plants because they can't afford to pay for the natural gas to run their units.	0
Others continue to produce electricity under their contracts with the state's utilities but aren't being paid even on a forward basis.	0
The California Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's electricity grid, said the loss of the QF generation was the primary reason rolling blackouts swept through the state Monday and Tuesday.	0
Gray Davis, recognizing the potential disaster if additional QFs took their units offline, held marathon meetings with key lawmakers Monday and Tuesday to try and hammer out an agreement that would get the QFs paid on a forward basis and set rates of 79/MWh and 69/MWh for five and 10 year contracts.	0
He also said he would direct the PUC to order the utilities to pay the QFs for power they sell going forward.	0
After next week the QF problem will be behind us, Davis said Tuesday.	0
We want to get the QFs paid...the QFs are dropping like flies...and when that happens the lights go out.	0
But this just makes the problem worse, said Assemblyman Dean Florez, D-Shafter, a member of the Assembly energy committee.	0
I don't know how we are going to keep the lights on, Florez said in an interview.	0
Many of these congenerators are in my district.	0
They said if the legislation doesn't change they are going offline.	0
This compounds the issue of rolling blackouts, especially now when we need every megawatt.	0
Davis, who didn't meet with people representing the QFs, said he was handing the QF issue to the PUC because lawmakers failed to pass legislation that would have set a five-year price for natural gas and allow the QFs to sign individual contracts with the utilities.	0
In addition, SOCal Ed opposed the legislation, saying the rates should be below 50/MWh.	0
Some renewable power producers said they aren't vehemently opposed to the new rate structure because it guarantees them a higher rate than what was originally proposed.	0
QFs Want Third Party Supply Contracts John Wood, who represents the SoCal Ed Gas Fired Creditors Committee, one of a handful of groups that have formed since January to explore options on getting paid by the utilities, said his group of gas-fired QF creditors want to be released from their supply contracts and sell to third parties.	0
Under our plan, we would be permitted to sell electricity to third parties including the state Department of Water Resources until a resolution to the crisis can be accomplished, wood said.	0
Hal Dittmer, president of Sacramento-based Wellhead Electric in Sacramento, which is owed 8 million by PG&E, has 85 MW of gas-fired generation units offline.	0
Under the state's plan, Dittmer said he risks going out of business.	0
I can't buy natural gas for what I would be paid under this decision, he said.	0
The state needs to quit kidding themselves that they don't need to raise electricity rates.	0
All of this is being driven by an artificial construct that California can avoid raising rates.	0
-By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com Power Strain Eases but Concerns Mount Energy: Officials say summer prices will be high, and a state report shows that contracts with generators are far short of goals.	0
DAN MORAIN; JENIFER WARREN TIMES STAFF WRITERS 03/22/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition A-3 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO -- California's fragile electricity system stabilized Wednesday, but a Davis administration report suggested troubles ahead because the state could be forced to buy most of its power for the coming summer on the costly and volatile spot market.	0
After two days of statewide blackouts, power plants that had been shut down were cranked up.	0
Unseasonable heat tapered off.	0
The operators of the statewide power grid relaxed their state of emergency.	0
But plenty of ominous signs remained.	0
Many small producers remained shut down, skeptical about Gov.	0
Gray Davis' plan for utilities to pay them.	0
State Controller Kathleen Connell issued a sharp warning about the high cost of the state's foray into the power business and announced that she will block an administration request that she transfer 5.6 billion into an account that could be tapped to pay for state purchases of electricity.	0
And a report from the administration summarizing contracts between Davis and independent power generators showed that the state has signed contracts for only 2,247 megawatts of electricity, significantly less than the 6,000 to 7,000 megawatts previously claimed.	0
While there are agreements in principle for the full amount, the report notes that generators can back out of the contracts for a variety of reasons, including the state's failure to sell bonds to finance power purchased by July 1.	0
The Legislature has approved plans to sell 10 billion in bonds, but none have yet been issued.	0
We are exposed enormously this summer, Senate Energy Committee chairwoman Debra Bowen D-Marina del Rey said after looking at the report.	0
We owe the people the truth about how difficult this summer is going to be.	0
We don't have a power fairy.	0
Perhaps most significant, the report suggests that the contracts fall significantly short of Davis' stated goal of buying no more than 5% of the state's summer needs on the spot electricity market, where prices can be many times those of long-term contracts.	0
After reading the report, Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who studies the California electricity market, said the numbers suggested that the state's long-term contracts will cover less than half of what the state will need this summer.	0
We're definitely short this summer, next summer and the summer of 2003, he said.	0
California was forced to start buying electricity in December--at a cost of 50 million a day--because producers refused to sell to Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric.	0
The two utilities amassed billions of dollars in debt when prices for wholesale power soared on the spot market.	0
Vikram Budhraja, a consultant retained by Davis to negotiate deals with generators, said the report represents a work in progress.	0
He said the state may yet sign new contracts.	0
However, Wolak said the contract figures confirm what he and others have been dreading: that summer is going to be rife with rolling blackouts unless serious steps to cut demand are taken immediately.	0
Wolak and other experts say large industrial customers must be switched to real-time meters and pricing to persuade them to use the bulk of their energy at times of low demand.	0
The head of the Energy Foundation, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that promotes sustainable sources of power, made the same proposal to Davis on Wednesday.	0
The government need not ask customers to swelter in the dark this summer, foundation President Hal Harvey argued in a letter.	0
He also proposed a crash campaign to boost sales of efficient appliances and lightbulbs.	0
He said the state needs to take over the utilities' contracts with alternative energy providers to ensure they stay in business, and sign new contracts for 1,500 megawatts of new wind power--the cheapest, fastest and cleanest source of new supply.	0
Davis had proposed a formula Tuesday to force private utilities to pay the alternative producers, some of which have not been paid since November.	0
But some of them warned Wednesday that Davis' plan offers them little incentive to turn on their generators.	0
Alternative energy producers supply more than a quarter of the electricity consumed in California.	0
Many producers generate electricity from wind, sun and geothermal sources.	0
But most of them generate power using natural gas--and the cost of natural gas has been soaring.	0
Several natural gas users said Davis' plan, which caps rates, won't cover their fuel costs.	0
Davis assumes that the price of natural gas will fall.	0
But small generators say they don't have sufficient purchasing power or sophistication to gamble on future prices.	0
The Public Utilities Commission is expected to approve Davis' proposal next week.	0
It offers producers two choices: 7.9 cents a kilowatt-hour if they agree to supply power for five years, or 6.9 cents a kilowatt-hour over 10 years.	0
The price of natural gas is higher than that, said Marty Quinn, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Ridgewood Power LLC, which owns three natural gas-fired co-generation plants.	0
If we operate, we'll lose money.	0
Ridgewood is not operating, having been cut off by gas suppliers.	0
The company sued PG&E last month seeking overdue payments and release from its contracts with the utility.	0
A hearing is scheduled in El Centro today in another lawsuit filed by a small energy producer, an Imperial Valley geothermal producer that sued Edison for refusing to let it break its contract and sell on the open market.	0
CalEnergy says Edison owes it about 140 million for energy sold since November.	0
A company spokesman, Jay Lawrence, said CalEnergy was going ahead with its suit despite Davis' proposal.	0
We've had promises before, he said.	0
In other developments: * A federal judge in Sacramento on Wednesday ordered Reliant Energy of Houston, a major producer, to continue selling power to California during emergencies, despite the company's argument that it may not be fully reimbursed.	0
The order will remain in effect for 60 days or until the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decides a related case.	0
* Connell said the state budget surplus has shrunk to 3.2 billion because the state has spent roughly 2.8 billion on electricity.	0
She criticized the administration for withholding basic information about state finances, and said she will begin an audit on Monday of the Department of Water Resources, which is responsible for purchasing power.	0
Davis' aides said Connell took her action because the Democratic governor endorsed one of Connell's foes this week in the race for Los Angeles mayor, former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa.	0
A Connell aide scoffed at the notion.	0
* Sen. Dianne Feinstein D-Calif. said she never has had a response from President Bush after writing him last month for an appointment to discuss the California energy crisis.	0
In a wide-ranging lunch talk with reporters in Washington, she deplored the fact that huge, huge profits are being made in the California crisis, and said an appropriate federal role would be to guarantee a reliable source of power until the state can get nine new generators online.	0
* Times staff writers Mitchell Landsberg in Los Angeles and Robert L. Jackson in Washington contributed to this report.	0
BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC Power Points Daily Developments * Wholesale electricity suppliers overcharged by about 5.5 billion between May and last month, and that money should be refunded to taxpayers and utilities, according to a Cal-ISO report.	0

Debra Bowen D-Marina del Rey , Senate Energy Committee chairwoman CPUC Must Address Rates In QF Repayment Order - SoCal Ed 03/21/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. LOS ANGELES - Dow Jones - Any order from the California Public Utilities Commission requiring utilities to pay small, independent generators going forward must determine how that could be done within the existing rate structure, a spokesman for Edison International EIX utility Southern California Edison said Wednesday.	0
The utility was responding to a PUC proposed decision that would require utilities to pay small generators, called qualifying facilities, 79 a megawatt hour within 15 days of electricity delivery.	0
The decision will be voted March 27 by the CPUC.	0
We're still reviewing the decision and should have more to say in a day or two.	0
To the extent that the commission orders us to pay going forward of course we will.	0
But it needs to address how we will pay the QFs, a SoCal Edison spokesman said.	0
SoCal Edison and PG&E Corp. PCG unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co. are struggling under nearly 13 billion in uncollected power costs due to an inability to pass high wholesale power costs to customers under a rate freeze.	0
Gray Davis Tuesday blasted the utilities for not having paid their QF bills in full since December.	0
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has made some partial payments to QFs, but SoCal Edison has paid nothing.	0
Together, they owe the QFs about 1 billion, but the order doesn't address that debt.	0
An Edison executive said, in reaction to the governor's sharp comments, that the company simply doesn't have the money to pay creditors.	0
The root problem here is there just isn't enough money in the current rate base to pay our bills, said Edison Senior Vice President of Public Affairs Bob Foster.	0
We understand the financial distress the QFs face; we are facing financial distress ourselves.	0
The proposed PUC order would also require the state's investor-owned utilities to offer the small generators five- and 10-year contracts for power for 79/MWh and 69/MWh, respectively.	0
The QFs may be able to live with the PUC proposal, but the five- and 10-year contract prices may be inadequate if natural gas prices at one of the California borders are high, said Jan Smutny-Jones, president of the Independent Energy Producers Association.	0
Natural gas prices into California are currently higher than anywhere in the country.	0
But some say the proposed decision may not be enough to prevent the QFs from filing involuntary bankruptcy proceedings against the utilities for the money they are still owed.	0
There's still a lot of skepticism.	0
To say our position has changed based on the CPUC decision or the governor's announcement is not accurate.	0
A lot still has to happen, said Jay Lawrence, a spokesman for a renewable creditors committee.	0
-By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872; jessica.berthold@dowjones.com -0- 22/03/01 01-27G State Says It's Accelerating Plan to Buy Power Utilities' Grid Government: Talks with Edison are reported near completion, but agreement with heavily indebted PG&E has a way to go.	0
RONE TEMPEST; DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITERS 03/21/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition A-22 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO -- As blackouts hit California for a second day Tuesday, a key consultant to Gov.	0
Gray Davis said negotiations to buy the power grid owned by the state's largest utilities are proceeding at an accelerated pace.	0
Wall Street consultant Joseph Fichera said talks with Southern California Edison could be wrapped up within days, although those with PG&E are much less advanced.	0
The administration and PG&E have not reached even an agreement in principle, he said.	0
PG&E, which has more debt than Edison, says its transmission lines are more extensive than those of its Southern California counterpart.	0
The state wants to buy the utilities' transmission lines and other assets for about 7 billion to provide cash to the utilities, help stabilize the electricity supply and ease the power crunch that has plagued California for months.	0
To research the grid purchase, Fichera said, the state has had to pore over 80,000 documents just to assess the utilities' liabilities.	0
We are working at a good pace, said Fichera, chief executive of the New York firm Saber Partners.	0
If we get to a deal-breaker, it might be longer.	0
By making Fichera, who is also a consultant to the Texas Public Utilities Commission, available to reporters Tuesday, the Davis administration was clearly trying to reassure the public that progress is being made on the governor's plan to pull the state out of the crisis.	0
Since mid-January, when the big utilities' credit failed and suppliers stopped selling to them, the state has spent nearly 3 billion buying electricity from a handful of large suppliers in Texas, Oklahoma, Georgia and North Carolina.	0
Not a cent has gone to the hundreds of alternative energy suppliers in California who provide about a quarter of the state's electricity.	0
The Monday and Tuesday blackouts occurred partly because many of the cash-strapped alternative suppliers, including solar, biomass and wind power units, cut their normal supply to the system in half.	0
They say Edison and PG&E have not paid them since November; the utilities say they are out of cash.	0
Assemblyman Fred Keeley D-Boulder Creek said the plight of the alternative suppliers has dragged on because of the complexity of dealing with almost 700 individual contractors.	0
Another delaying factor, said Keeley, who with state Sen. Jim Battin R-La Quinta worked for almost three months to come up with a legislative plan to lower the small producers' prices, was the huge enmity .	0
manifested between the utilities and the qualifying facilities.	0
These people just don't like each other.	0
This week's blackouts provided two painful lessons for the Davis administration: * When it comes to electricity, size doesn't matter--every kilowatt counts.	0
During peak use, a small wind power facility in Riverside County can make the difference between full power and blackouts.	0
* There is no such thing as a partial solution.	0
Unless the whole energy equation is balanced, the parts don't work.	0
For the Davis plan to work, several key elements need to come together or utility customers will almost certainly face rate increases above the 19% already set in motion * The cost of power purchased by the state must be reduced through long-term contracts with the big out-of-state producers.	0
These contracts, the details of which the Davis administration has kept confidential, are still being negotiated by Davis consultant Vikram Budhraja of the Pasadena firm Electric Power Group.	0
The administration says it has concluded 40 contracts with generators, about half of which have been signed.	0
According to the most recent statistics released by the Department of Water Resources, which buys power for the state, current prices are still well above the rate state Treasurer Phil Angelides says is necessary for a planned 10-billion bond offering to succeed.	0
The bonds, set for sale in May, will be used to reimburse the state for the money it will have spent by that time to buy electricity.	0
The state is currently spending at a rate of 58 million a day to buy power.	0
If prices stay high, the 10 billion in bonds will not cover the state's power purchases by the end of the summer.	0
Angelides says he cannot proceed with bridge financing for the bonds until the Public Utilities Commission devises a formula to guarantee that a portion of utility bills will be dedicated to bond repayment.	0
Angelides has estimated that, under the January law that put the state in the power buying business, the state must be reimbursed 2.5 billion annually, and that 1.3 billion is needed to service the debt.	0
PUC Administrative Law Judge Joseph R. DeUlloa is expected to announce his ruling on the reimbursement rate later this week, leading to a PUC vote on the matter as early as next week.	0
* The rates charged for electricity by the alternative producers, known as qualifying facilities, must be cut at least in half, down from an average of more than 17 cents per kilowatt-hour.	0
In his news conference Tuesday, Davis said he will ask the PUC to set QF rates at 6.9 cents for 10-year contracts and 7.5 cents for five-year contracts.	0
Meanwhile, PUC Chairman Loretta Lynch, a Davis appointee, said Tuesday that the commission will vote next week on a proposed order requiring Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric to pay the QFs for electricity in the future.	0
Lynch said a recent PUC assessment showed that the utilities have enough cash on hand for that.	0
We are trying to make sure the folks providing the power get paid, Lynch said.	0
The qualified facilities have demonstrated that they haven't been paid and that it is impairing their ability to provide power.	0
The utilities contend that if they pay the small providers what they owe them, there will not be enough money left to pay other creditors.	0
There is not enough money in the current rate structure to pay the alternative producers , pay the Department of Water Resources and pay the utilities for their generation, said John Nelson, a spokesman for PG&E.	0
* The utilities must sell to the state the power they produce themselves, mainly from hydro and nuclear sources, at a rate only slightly above the cost of producing it.	0
This is tied to the ongoing negotiations between the Davis administration and the utilities to restore the near-bankrupt utilities to solvency.	0

Davis OKs Subsidy of Pollution Fees Smog: As part of secret deal to get long-term energy contracts, state would pay for some of the credits that allow excess power plant emissions.	0
Critics renew call for full disclosure.	0
DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITER 03/21/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition A-23 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO -- As part of his closed-door negotiations to buy electricity, Gov.	0
Gray Davis has agreed to relieve some generators from having to pay potentially millions of dollars in fees for emitting pollutants into the air, Davis said Tuesday.	0
Davis announced two weeks ago that his negotiators had reached deals with 20 generators to supply 43 billion worth of power during the next 10 years.	0
However, the Democratic governor has refused to release any of the contracts or detail various terms, contending that release of such information would hamper the state's ability to negotiate deals with other generators and therefore ultimately would raise prices Californians pay for electricity.	0
Sources familiar with the negotiations, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the agreement reached with Dynegy Inc., a power company based in Houston, is one that includes language requiring that the state pay the cost of credits that allow emissions.	0
Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel declined to discuss the company's deal with the state.	0
We couldn't get them to sign contracts; it was a sticking point, Davis said of the decision to pay the fees of some generators.	0
We had to lock down some power so we were not totally dependent on the spot market.	0
The fees in question are part of an emission trading system known as RECLAIM.	0
Under the system, companies are allotted a certain amount of allowable pollution.	0
If their operations pollute more, companies are required to purchase credits on an open market.	0
Currently the credits cost about 45 per pound of pollution--an amount that can lead to a bill of well over 10 million a year for a power plant.	0
The South Coast Air Quality Management District, which regulates pollution in the Los Angeles Basin, is considering steps to significantly lower the cost of the system--a step that could considerably cut the state's potential cost, Davis said.	0
Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen D-Marina del Rey defended the decision to cover the power company's costs.	0
It is a question of whether it brings down the price of power, she said.	0
If it brings down the price of power, I don't have a problem with it.	0
Nevertheless, word that the contracts could bind the state to pay pollution fees caused some critics of Davis' policy to renew calls for Davis to reconsider the secrecy surrounding the power negotiations.	0
The payment provision underscores the fact that the contracts involve more than merely the prices the state will pay for its megawatts, the critics note.	0
The Legislature should have known about it, said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton D-San Francisco .	0
It is going to cost taxpayers money.	0
It makes you wonder.	0
This was a policy issue that was never discussed with the Legislature.	0
V. John White, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, who also represents alternative energy producers, called the contract proposal a horrible precedent.	0
Until we know exactly what the state has agreed to and how much of a subsidy this represents, we can't determine how serious the breach of principle this is, White said.	0
Another critic of the secrecy of the negotiations, Terry Francke, general counsel for the California First Amendment Coalition, said the provision in question raises the possibility that there are other concessions that have not yet come to light.	0
In the summer, when demand for power is highest, some generators probably will exceed pollution limits set by regional air quality management districts.	0
To avert blackouts, state officials might ask the companies to keep plants running.	0
In such cases, some sources familiar with aspects of the contracts said, the contract language could be interpreted to suggest that the state would cover any fines--although Davis said Tuesday the state will not cover the cost of fines.	0
A recent Dynegy filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission underscores the rising cost of pollution-related measures.	0
The company, which is partners with NRG Energy in three California plants in El Segundo, Long Beach and Carlsbad in San Diego County, said its aggregate expenditures for compliance with laws related to the regulation of discharge of materials into the environment rose to 14.3 million in 2000, from 3.6 million in 1999.	0
A South Coast Air Quality Management spokesman said Dynegy's facilities appear to be fairly clean--although Sierra Club lobbyist White said Dynegy has been seeking a permit at one of its plants to burn fuel oil, which is dirtier than natural gas.	0
Davis said he intends to make this information public, but he added that we do not want to put the public's interest in jeopardy by asking them to pay higher prices.	0
Nobody likes the notion that the administration is not being fully forthcoming, Davis said.	0
But I also have a corollary responsibility that I don't stick these generators with a higher rate.	0
FERC ORDERS WILLIAMS ENERGY AND AES TO EXPLAIN THEIR REFUSAL TO MAKE CERTAIN RMR UNITS AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA ISO LAST YEAR 03/21/2001 Foster Electric Report 5 c Copyright 2001, Foster Associates, Inc.	0
Following a preliminary, non-public investigation, FERC directed AES Southland Inc. and Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Co. IN01-3 on March 14 to show cause why they did not violate section 205 of the Federal Power Act FPA by failing to provide power to the California ISO from two reliability must-run RMR generator units during a period in April and May 2000.	0
The investigation responded to a matter referred by the Cal-ISO.	0
If a violation is found, Williams Energy and AES could be required to refund excess profits of 10.9 million as calculated by FERC and face restrictions on their market-based rate authority for a year.	0
The show cause order involves two generation units Alamitos 4 and Huntington Beach 2 , owned and operated by AES.	0
Williams Energy markets all output from the Alamitos and Huntington Beach plants, including the two units at issue here, pursuant to a tolling agreement filed with the Commission.	0
The Cal-ISO designated the two units as RMR units that it could call on when necessary to provide energy and ancillary service essential to the reliability of the California transmission network.	0
The Cal-ISO makes both a fixed payment to the RMR owner or operator to compensate for the RMR unit's availability and a variable payment for the RMR unit's output if the unit is not otherwise participating in the market .	0
Williams Energy and the Cal-ISO executed RMR agreements, filed as rate schedules with the Commission, allowing the Cal-ISO to dispatch units solely for purposes of meeting local reliability needs or managing intra-zonal congestion.	0
The ISO may dispatch a non-RMR unit if the designated RMR unit is not available.	0
Under its RMR agreement with the ISO, Williams is paid the greater of its contract price or marginal cost for operating RMR units.	0
However, if a non-RMR unit has to be dispatched because a designated RMR unit is unavailable, Williams will be paid its bid price, not the RMR contract price.	0
During the April to May 2000 period, the Cal-ISO sought to dispatch both Alamitos 4 and Huntington Beach 2 as RMR units to provide voltage support.	0
However, according to the FERC order, Williams Energy refused to make Alamitos 4 available from April 25 through May 5, and to make Huntington Beach 2 available from May 6 through May 11, for reasons not directly related to the necessary and timely maintenance of the units.	0
Consequently, the Cal-ISO was forced to dispatch non-RMR units at a higher cost, namely, Williams Energy's bid price for service provided by the replacement units.	0
By contrast, if the RMR units had not experienced outages and been available from April 25 through May 11, Williams Energy would have received either 1 the market revenues only from the respective units, which would have resulted in no payments for RMR output from the ISO to Williams Energy, or 2 Williams Energy's variable cost for operating the RMR units less the market revenues from the respective units' output.	0
Accordingly, FERC observed, Williams Energy had a financial incentive to prolong any outages of Alamitos 4 and Huntington Beach 2 in April and May 2000.	0
The bid price for the non-RMR units was at or near the Cal-ISO's then-effective bid cap of 750/MWh, FERC continued.	0
Therefore, Williams Energy received payments from the Cal-ISO of more than 11.3 million, or about 10.3 million greater than the estimated average variable operating cost of the non-RMR units approximately 63/MWh during the period in question.	0
This indicates a refund amount, including interest, of nearly 10.9 million.	0
The information in this order and a non-public appendix, the Commission declared, suggests that AES declared outages at the two RMR units and maintained Huntington Beach 2 in a manner inconsistent with good utility practice, and that Williams Energy took action to extend the outage at Alamitos 4 and to make Huntington Beach 2 unavailable for pretextual reasons.	0
Based on this information coupled with Williams Energy's financial incentive not to make the Alamitos 4 and Huntington Beach 2 units available, FERC found serious questions about whether 1 AES and Williams Energy violated applicable RMR contracts and tariffs on file with the Commission pursuant to FPA section 205 when they refused to make Alamitos 4 and Huntington Beach 2 available for dispatch by the Cal-ISO; 2 whether Williams acted inconsistently with its market-based rate authority and the market monitoring information protocols of the Cal-ISO's tariff regarding the unavailability of the RMR units during the period at issue; and 3 whether AES violated a tolling agreement on file with the Commission pursuant to section 205.	0
The Commission identified two remedies for these potential violations: a refund by Williams Energy and/or AES of revenues received greater than the amount that would have collected from the ISO if the RMR units had been available, and a condition on Williams Energy's market-based rate authority.	0
Specifically, for a one-year period, if an RMR unit were not available when dispatched by the Cal-ISO, a non-RMR unit dispatched in its place would only receive payment according to the terms of the applicable RMR contract.	0
In other words, Williams Energy would not receive the bid price for operation of the substitute, non- RMR unit.	0
The Commission directed Williams Energy and AES to show cause, within 20 days, why they should not be found to have committed the above-described violations and why the specified remedies should not be imposed.	0
Further, to ensure procurement of all relevant information, the Commission instituted a formal, non-public investigation into the operation, maintenance and sales of power from the Alamitos and Huntington Beach plants in 2000 and 2001.	0
Calif Consumers Failing To Conserve Pwr Despite Blackouts 03/20/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. LOS ANGELES - Dow Jones - California consumers haven't been conserving enough electricity to relieve strain on the power grid and reduce demand in the state, a spokesman with the Independent System Operator said Tuesday.	0
The ISO said that despite two straight days of statewide rolling blackouts, consumers aren't using less electricity, which means additional megawatts will be taken off the grid.	0
As a result, blackouts could last longer and impact additional communities, the ISO said.	0
ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said Monday conservation in California is no longer an option, but consumers in the state aren't heeding the call to reduce consumption.	0
Conservation efforts during rolling blackouts Monday and Tuesday were far less than Jan. 17 and Jan. 18, when blackouts swept through Northern California due to transmission constraints.	0
Jim Detmers, the ISO's vice president of operation, said consumers saved the state about 1,000 megawatts of electricity, enough power for 1 million houses.	0
The ISO said conservation efforts Monday were about 500 MW or less.	0
We would be very happy if we saw the same amount this time, Detmers said.	0
The state's Energy Commission said consumers think it's no longer important to save electricity until blackouts are imposed.	0
People have been saving generally, but it isn't a big bump from hour to hour, a spokesman for the Energy Commission said.	0
Gray Davis launched a massive conservation campaign this month, promising consumers a rebate on their summer electricity bill if they save at least 20% of electricity, compared with last summer.	0
The governor said he believes conservation this summer will amount to possibly saving 5,000 MW and averting the chance of rolling blackouts.	0
-By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com Gas Co.'s Success Opens Debate Southern California energy supplier has reaped millions of dollars in state incentives for keeping down its costs.	0
Though consumers get a share of the windfall, regulators are asking whether they should get more of the bonus, which is expected to be huge this year, as a form of price relief.	0
The natural gas provider says it deserves to keep its reward.	0
TIM REITERMAN TIMES STAFF WRITER 03/18/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition C-1 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company SAN FRANCISCO -- While consumers suffer soaring energy bills and the big electric utilities lurch toward insolvency, the news is not all dire at Southern California Gas Co.	0
Through vigorous deal making, the Sempra Energy subsidiary has consistently beaten the volatile natural gas market during the last year, and the company stands to reap millions of dollars in savings through a state incentive program that rewards utilities for keeping costs down.	0
For several years, the utility has been splitting the savings 50-50 with ratepayers whenever the company's gas costs fall slightly below market levels.	0
Those savings, Gas Co. executives acknowledged, have shot to unprecedented heights during the state's power crisis.	0
Now, in this climate of high consumer gas bills and runaway market prices, regulators are taking another look at the program.	0
The total windfall under the incentive program has in some years exceeded 20 million.	0
But the amount for the last 12 months is expected to multiply many times over, company executives said, partly because the Gas Co. has done so well in the wild market by selling, lending and trading gas as well as buying it.	0
The recent market conditions .	0
could possibly result in some unintended consequences that result in shared savings of benefits that may be more appropriately allocated entirely to ratepayers, the PUC's consumer protection arm, the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, reported Oct. 30, even before the latest upward market spirals.	0
Gas Co. representatives express frustration, saying they have done what the state has requested under its gas-cost incentive program: Buy smarter, and pass the savings along to its 5 million residential and small-business customers.	0
The company contends it has worked hard to keep bills down and should be rewarded for taking risks to obtain gas at the lowest possible cost.	0
The PUC, every time we do well, raises the bar on us, said Jim Harrigan, director of gas acquisition.	0
I don't necessarily agree with it.	0
By virtue of its purchasing power and storage and pipeline capacity, the Gas Co. has become a big player in the regional natural gas market.	0
In the company's bustling trading room at its Los Angeles headquarters, 15 employees track price movements, pipeline supplies and even the weather via computer, while cutting deals and arranging gas shipments.	0
Although the Gas Co. buys the commodity for its customers, the company also sells to marketers, other utilities and producers.	0
State officials say the number of transactions by the company has risen steeply to 10,000 to 20,000 a year, including gas sales along California's border, where prices have rocketed.	0
The PUC created the cost incentive program for the state's three major gas utilities--San Diego Gas & Electric Co. in 1993, Southern California Gas the next year and PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. in 199	0
Like Southern California Gas, SDG&E is a subsidiary of Sempra Energy.	0
The program was designed to give utilities added motivation for obtaining gas at the best price for customers.	0
It replaced lengthy and contentious reviews by the PUC, which assessed whether utilities had purchased gas at reasonable prices and sometimes ordered them to return millions of dollars to customers.	0
An annual audit of the Gas Co. program and a staff evaluation requested by the PUC recently concluded that the program has achieved many of its goals, but it also proposed adjustments that would give customers a greater share of the rewards.	0
These incentives were designed in less volatile times, said program supervisor Mark Pocta of the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, which conducted the audit.	0
There is a question of how much should go to ratepayers and shareholders.	0
His office also plans to assess whether the Gas Co.'s trading had any negative effects on the gas market, resulting in diminished supplies or higher prices for other utilities and their customers.	0
Under the program, the Gas Co. shares risks and rewards with its ratepayers, but since the program was launched, it has consistently produced awards.	0
If the cost of gas is 0.5% or more below a benchmark based on monthly gas market indexes, the company and its customers split the savings 50-50.	0
California's gas utilities are not allowed to profit on their raw commodity costs; they merely pass along those costs to ratepayers with no markup.	0
The savings under the incentive program are automatically reflected in consumers' monthly gas bills but are not itemized.	0
At the end of the year, the utilities request their share of the savings, and the PUC has routinely granted approval.	0
Then the companies, and thus their shareholders, are paid through customer utility bills.	0
The resulting bill increases typically have been modest, less than 1%.	0
But as the awards increase, regulators say, the effect on customers will become more significant unless the present structure is changed.	0
There's no question, when you start to talk about 100 million or more in savings , and add the company's award into rates in a year, it will make a noticeable difference, said Los Angeles economist Jeff Leitzinger, president of Econ One, who has done consulting for the Gas Co.	0
Still, he said, ratepayers should bear in mind that they already benefit from below-market gas and transportation costs.	0
In the early years of the program, records show, the Gas Co.'s awards went from zero to 3.2 million, 10.6 million, 2 million and 7.7 million.	0
Last year's award of 9.8 million is awaiting PUC approval.	0
This year's proposed award, covering the period through the end of this month, has not yet been submitted by the Gas Co.	0
But the utility has provided monthly figures and oral updates on a confidential basis to PUC officials, who declined to provide figures.	0
Harrigan of the Gas Co. said the savings are expected to multiply many times over, largely because the company was well-equipped for the market fluctuations and tried to insulate its customers from high gas prices.	0
Any trading company, especially one with assets like we have, has benefited from volatility in the market, he said.	0
Harrigan said, however, that he does not believe the company's level of activity has adversely affected the market and that its trading pales in volume to that of unregulated energy companies.	0
Anne Smith, the Gas Co.'s vice president of customer service and marketing, said the utility will not release figures for this year's incentive program until they are filed with the PUC in June.	0
I don't want to interrupt that process, Smith said, noting that the PUC ultimately will determine the company's award.	0
I think they need to focus on what the Gas Co. has done for the ratepayers.	0
It has been immense.	0
Although the typical monthly gas bill has risen to 80 from 50 a year ago, Gas Co. customers tend to have lower rates than those of other California utilities.	0
The company's gas procurement cost in February was 66 cents per therm, or 100 cubic feet.	0
That's more than twice last year's cost but only about half what sister company SDG&E paid for its 740,000 customers in February.	0
It's also much lower than the 1.09 per therm PG&E pays.	0
We were as upset about the overall gas price increase as anyone else, Harrigan said.	0
I would rather see the prices of a year ago, even though we managed to do a little better in the recent environment.	0
When it comes to keeping down costs, regulators say, the Gas Co. has advantages over other utilities in the marketplace.	0
For one, the company has so much pipeline capacity at major gas basins that it purchases a relatively small portion of its needs--about 10% to 15%--at the California border, where prices in December briefly rose to the equivalent of 6 per therm, or 20 times those a year earlier.	0
This presents opportunities.	0
At the beginning of the month, they forecast a certain amount of gas they have to buy, said Pocta of the Office of Ratepayer Advocates.	0
If they go out and buy and do not need to use as much because the weather is more moderate than expected, they can either inject the gas into storage or they can make sales at the border.	0
Customers, he pointed out, may be entitled to additional benefits because they pay for the interstate and intrastate pipeline capacity and the gas storage that give the company the flexibility to make advantageous deals.	0
By the same token, we want the Gas Co. .	0
to go into the market and generate cost savings that can be passed on to the customers, he added.	0
We want them to have incentives.	0
The question is how to balance them.	0
Under deregulation, the Gas Co. adopted the nontraditional role of marketer, according to a PUC Energy Division report in January.	0
The company makes gas sales at various locations.	0
It engages in exchanges.	0
It makes futures transactions to help stabilize costs.	0
They look for ways to lower the gas cost, said Richard Myers, program supervisor at the Energy Division.	0
Before they were lots more risk-averse.	0
Now they feel they can take risks and make money for shareholders, and it is a benefit for ratepayers at the same time.	0
The incentive programs are tailored to individual utilities, so it is difficult to compare them.	0
Records show that the shared savings at SDG&E, a much smaller utility, declined steadily from 9.2 million in the 1996-97 cycle to 560,000 in 1999-2000.	0
Spokesman Ed Van Herik said the falloff largely represents a drop in gas purchases, especially as the company sold off its own gas-fired electricity-generating plants.	0
He said the company does not yet know how much savings have accrued in the last year.	0
In an annual report to the PUC in February, PG&E said it had no savings under the incentive program and thus it is not entitled to any award for the 1999-2000 cycle.	0
The Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco-based consumer advocacy group, said it will closely watch the PUC's evaluation of the incentive program at the Gas Co. We want to make sure, given the dramatic changes in the gas market and prices, ratepayers are not left out of the additional benefits, TURN attorney Marcel Hawiger said.	0
We'll look to see whether the mechanism should be changed.	0
Severin Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at UC Berkeley, said the program should be changed to provide more incentive for utilities to enter long-term contracts that would smooth out volatility in the market.	0
Unfortunately, under the system, he said, the only incentive is to beat the spot market.	0

Delivering the keynote address at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's national energy summit in Washington Monday, Abraham said, California is not the only state facing a mismatch between supply and demand, what with electricity shortages predicted for New York City and Long Island this summer and low capacity margins threatening electricity reliability elsewhere across the country.	0
Not very, says energy trade specialist Edward Krapels, managing director of Boston-based METIS Trading Advisors.	0
Krapels, a consultant helping major Northeastern utilities, such as Consolidated Edison, design market-hedging programs, adamantly decried what he said are facile comparisons between conditions in New York and California, there being more differences than there are similarities between those two industrial cornerstones of the country's economy in respect to energy security management.	0
First of all, New York has a more varied portfolio of energy generation sources than California, he said.	0
California has hydro, nuclear and gas, but when it lost a lot of hydro, the state needed gas to pick up the slack, and the capacity just wasn't there.	0
In New York's case, the state has oil and coal still in the mix and its overall dependence on gas is much lower than California's, Krapels added.	0
New York avoids making same mistakes Portfolio diversity is one pillar of any effective plan to help New York avoid the same errors made in redesigning California's marketplace.	0
New York's Independent System Operator ISO , in a new report warning that the state is at an energy crossroads in terms of its capacity adequacy in the immediate future, argues that a concerted effort is required to arrest declining in-state generation capacity reserve margins, and a strategy must be put in place, whether or not new generation comes on-line, in accordance with current anticipated scenarios.	0
A measure of New York's essential difficulty is that, between 1995 and 2000, statewide demand for electricity grew 2,700 MW, while generating capacity expanded by only 1,060 MW.	0
With no major new generating plants in downstate New York fully approved, the gap is expected to continue to widen.	0
To avoid a replication of California's market meltdown the New York ISO calculates the state's daily generating capacity needs to grow by 8,600 MW by 2005, with more than half of that located in New York City and on Long Island.	0
Expressing concern this may be too big a burden for the current bureaucratic process to bear, the ISO wants to see a state-appointed ombudsman named to help would-be merchant power plant investors plow through red tape.	0
Increasing New York's generating capacity will also lessen the state's escalating and risky reliance on out-of-state sources of electricity, the ISO added.	0
Since 1999, New York State has been unable to cover its reserve requirements from in-state sources.	0
Not everyone agrees with that analysis, insofar as it argues for circling the wagons inward.	0
Some analysts believe the ultimate solution lies not in tying in more inwardly dedicated power, but in expanding the marketplace by breaking down inter-jurisdictional barriers.	0
In any case, New York energy regulatory authorities and those responsible elsewhere in the U.S. Northeast, such as PJM Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection and the New England Power Pool, are in vastly better shape in terms of cross-border cooperation than California and its neighbors in that efforts are being made among various authorities toward developing an integrated regional electricity market.	0
Embedded image moved to file: pic05075.pcx The New York ISO's new broad-based analysis of market-restructuring needs argues that the relatively stronger health of its reformed environment is due in large part to the ability of New York's utilities to enter into long-term power contracts.	0
What needs to be done most, it says, is to move aggressively to build some of the more than 29,000 MW of proposed new generation in the siting pipeline.	0
In the meantime, the 30,200 MW of electricity New Yorkers used on a peak day last summer shouldn't be eclipsed on too many days this coming summer given early long-range weather forecasts .	0
Demand, however, is expected to increase at an annual average rate of up to 1.4%.	0
So while New York City, the rest of the state and adjacent parts might breathe easy this year, it could be a brief rest from the fray.	0
Meanwhile, a 4% shortfall is still being planned for this summer that is not yet provided for, as authorities hurriedly seek to arrange new generation plants around Manhattan, on Long Island and even on barges offshore.	0
One way or another, whether it is the weather or the politics of siting new energy facilities, it's going to be a hot time in the city.	0
Long-term solutions hit brick wall Meanwhile, attempts at longer-term solutions continue to run into trouble.	0
Last week, Connecticut state regulators came out against a proposal to run a new underwater cable under Long Island Sound that Hydro-Quebec subsidiary TransEnergie U.S. Ltd. wants to build to pump more juice into Long Island Power Authority's load pocket.	0
Despite strong promises from TransEnergie to be diligent in avoiding damage to oyster beds in Long Island Sound, the proposal failed to convince authorities, who were persuaded the pipeline project could lead to diversion of electricity from Connecticut.	0
The David vs. Goliath nature of such controversies has further alerted energy companies to the difficulties of addressing complex energy supply issues that may ultimately devolve to people not wanting things in their backyard, regardless of what the alternative might mean to their fellow citizens or the greater public good.	0
may not be so far away.	0
By some estimates, this summer's bills for Consolidated Edison customers could be up as much as one third or more over last year's charges.	0
Letting the time slip when it comes to building new infrastructure isn't going to make the pain go away.	0
NEW YORK: NY-ISO REPORT SAYS STATE NEEDS 4,000 - 5,000 MW OF NEW GENERATION SOON TO AVOID SEVERE SHORTAGES; NY-ISO ALSO ASKS FERC TO EXTEND BID CAP AND TEMPORARY EMERGENCY PROCEDURES 03/21/2001 Foster Electric Report 2 c Copyright 2001, Foster Associates, Inc. Raising the specter of an East Coast version of the California crisis, the New York Independent System Operator, Inc. NY-ISO is warning of serious electricity shortages, air quality deterioration and stunted economic growth without immediate approval of between 4,000-5,000 MW of new generating capacity in the state.	0
Of this amount, 2,000-3,000 MW is needed to serve New York City.	0
Another 8,600 MW of new capacity will have to be built by 2005, the NY-ISO said in a recent report, Power Alert: New York's Energy Crossroads.	0
New York is heading towards a very serious situation unless it acts immediately to get new supply sited within its borders, said NY-ISO president William Museler in a statement accompanying the report.	0
This report is essentially a caution light at New York's energy crossroads.	0
Sources in the New York Public Service Commission have downplayed the NY-ISO's warning, asserting that a process for bringing on new generation is well underway, with more than 85 projects in the approval pipeline.	0
In a related development, the NY-ISO asked FERC to approve a proposed tariff amendment ER01-1517 extending existing bids caps in some of its markets until 10/31/02, and a separate and related amendment ER01-1489 extending the NY-ISO's so-called temporary extraordinary procedures TEP that allow the ISO to make price adjustments and take other corrective actions if it finds evidence of market power abuse.	0
The NY-ISO Report --The NY-ISO likened the situation in New York to that faced by California, where a relentless increase in demand has not been met with an equal increase in supply.	0
The NY-ISO said that between 1995 and 2000, statewide demand for electricity rose by 2,700 MW, while generating capacity increased by only 1,060 MW.	0
With no major new generating plants in downstate New York fully approved for construction at this time and generation demand in the state expected to grow around 1.3 percent annually for the next several years, the NY-ISO said this gap will continue to widen.	0
The inevitable result of this trend is large rate increases for New York's power consumers.	0
The NY-ISO's modeling suggests that by 2005, statewide prices are likely to be more than 20-25 percent lower in the case in which new plants are built than in the case where they are not.	0
In New York City, the price to consumers of electric power could be reduced by as much as 28 percent when compared to the case of no new supply or load management programs.	0
Besides large rate increases, the NY-ISO asserted that a failure to site and build new plants in New York will threaten power reliability in the state and lead to increasing reliance on out-of-state resources.	0
The report said that if no new in-state generation comes on line in the next five years, the state's generation reserve margins will shrink from the current 14.9 percent above peak demand to a dangerously low 8.4 percent by 2005.	0
Pointing to California's situation, the report added that increased reliance on power imports can subject electrical suppliers and customers in New York to transmission restrictions and political and economic considerations beyond the control or influence of responsible New York State entities.	0
To avoid these harsh consequences, the NY-ISO said New York's new siting law, known as the Article X process, needs to be modified.	0
Since the law was passed 18 months ago, the report noted that only two plants have been approved both upstate and neither has yet been built.	0
The problem, according to the NY-ISO, is that the siting process requires the cooperation of multiple state agencies.	0
To expedite the process, the report suggested the clear designation of a lead agency and the adoption of an ombudsman program' to expedite and coordinate the work of the agencies responsible for the Article X process must be made.	0
The NY-ISO added that an expedited approval process would improve the environment because older, more polluting power plants would be replaced by cleaner gas-fired units.	0
On a more positive note, the NY-ISO reported that New York's restructured power market is far healthier than that in California, due in large part to the ability of New York s utilities to enter long-term power contracts.	0
The basic structure of the New York market will also reduce unwarranted price spikes and other market disruptions through mitigation programs which automatically correct price spikes due to market power abuses.	0
Nevertheless, California s experience raises a caution flag for all New Yorkers, the report continued.	0
The deregulated market in New York cannot achieve lower costs through competition without an increase in generating capacity similar in magnitude to the recommendations of this report, along with simultaneous efforts to institute greater conservation, better load management and alternative energy supply initiatives.	0
Additionally, closer integration with regional suppliers of power is both inevitable and beneficial.	0
The report also recommended 1 accelerating conservation, real-time metering and price-sensitive load programs; and 2 upgrading the state's and the Northeast's transmission infrastructure.	0
The Proposed Tariff Amendments -- New York's Article X siting process and continuing tight supplies were also cited in the NY-ISO's request to extend from 4/30/01 until 10/31/02 its 1,000/MWh bid caps.	0
FERC first approved the 1,000/MWh bid caps in July 2000 see REPORT No.197, pg.6 , and subsequently extended them.	0
The NY-ISO's board is sensitive to the Commission's concerns about undue intervention in energy markets, the filing related.	0
Nevertheless, the NY-ISO is submitting this request because it believes that delays in New York state's Article X' process for licensing and siting new generating capacity is inhibiting supply from increasing to match continued demand growth.	0
Moreover, although the NY-ISO proposes to implement several demand-side measures this summer, it is not yet clear whether they will make demand sufficiently price-responsive to avoid periods of high prices that would not occur if there were an efficient demand-side response.	0
Thus, the NY-ISO insisted that the requested extension is needed to provide more time for the development of additional generation and to gauge the effectiveness of the NY-ISO's proposed demand-side response mechanisms in order to avoid exposing consumers to price spikes that are not a product of the interplay of competitive market forces.	0
Other problems cited in the NY-ISO's filing which keep New York's power market from being fully competitive include continuing capacity and operating constraints at the state's Central-East interface, and questions over adequate gas supply.	0
The NY-ISO remains acutely aware that taking steps to deal with price abnormalities can have undesirable consequences, the filing continued.	0
Nevertheless, the NY-ISO believes that the 1,000/MWh cap that has been used in the PJM's markets since inception does not appear to have had an adverse impact there.	0
The permanent bid caps in PJM, and the interim bid caps in ISO New England proposed for extension through the end of 2001 also make continuation of the NY-ISO's bid caps more important in order to maintain uniformity across the Northeastern markets.	0
The NY-ISO also continues to believe that suppliers will not be materially harmed by the continuation of bid caps, which are likely to come into effect very rarely and are set at levels that prevent only artificially high run-ups in prices.	0
The NY-ISO's request to extend its TEP procedures which also were previously extended through 10/31/02 cited similar problems with New York's power markets, but claimed that the NY-ISO has made great strides toward eliminating market design and software flaws.	0
The TEPs were, and remain, an indispensable tool for responding to and correcting market flaws and other instances where the markets are not operating as the NY-ISO and the Commission intended, the filing insisted.	0
MASSACHUSETTS: Attorney general says summer poses electricity concerns By JOHN McELHENNY Associated Press Writer 03/19/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001.	0
BOSTON AP - The state's top consumer advocate warned that Massachusetts may see California-type electricity blackouts this summer when temperatures rise and residents turn on air conditioners and fans.	0
It would be a mistake to feel this is a cold weather problem, said Attorney General Thomas Reilly in an interview with The Associated Press.	0
Our major problem will come this summer.	0
State deregulation of the electric industry has been among the factors blamed for local power outages in California, and on Monday, California for the first time suffered rolling blackouts across the entire state.	0
Massachusetts relaxed regulations on its own electric industry in 1998 to attract more companies to stir competition.	0
But that hasn't happened yet, largely because the current high cost of oil and gas make it expensive to produce electricity.	0
The promise of deregulation was that there was going to be competition, said Reilly, a Democrat.	0
That competition in the wholesale market is not happening.	0
Hot summer weather drives up electricity use as residents turn on air conditioners and fans, and Reilly said a few particularly hot days could strain the grid that provides the region's power.	0
A spokeswoman for the region's power grid said electricity use is expected to rise 1.5 to 2 percent this year, but the region should have enough power because of six new power plants that have begun generating electricity in the past 18 months.	0
The situation is unlike California because we have new generation coming on line that is outpacing demand, said Ellen Foley, spokeswoman for ISO New England Inc., which manages the grid of 330 generators connected by 8,000 miles of high voltage transmission lines.	0
Still, a particularly hot day and an unforeseen power generation breakdown could prompt ISO to ask residents to conserve electricity, a situation that arose once last summer, Foley said.	0
In order to avoid any power outages and protect consumers, Reilly repeated calls for electric companies to build more power lines and to offer more options for new customers who have signed up since deregulation.	0
Those customers typically pay more than long-term customers.	0
Electric transmission companies should also be allowed to enter into two-year contracts with suppliers, instead of the six-month contracts many have now, to avoid short-term price spikes for consumers, Reilly said.	0
The Attorney General's Office acts as an advocate for consumers.	0
Michael Monahan, a spokesman for NSTAR, which provides electricity to more than 1 million customers, is upgrading some of its power lines and last year built a new line to Cape Cod, but currently has no lines under construction.	0
I wholeheartedly concur with the attorney general that it's something we have to focus on, Monahan said, but he added, The indications I see are that we have an ample supply of electricity.	0
California's statewide outages were ordered on Monday after a transformer fire, high demand and a lack of electricity imports pushed power reserves to near zero.	0
California partially deregulated its electric industry in 1996, two years before Massachusetts.	0
CARSON CITY, Nev. AP - Lawmakers hit more delays Monday in trying to pass a measure that pulls the plug on the sale of Nevada power plants to avoid California-style energy problems.	0
The goal of this bill is only stopping the divestiture of power plants and making sure it's constitutional, said Senate Commerce and Labor Chairman Randolph Townsend, R-Reno.	0
And that's not as easy as it sounds.	0
Townsend's comment just before his committee began working on SB253 was prophetic - witnesses kept bringing up the need for more flexibility in the measure.	0
Translation: Don't kill all deals by stopping Reno-based Sierra Pacific Power and Las Vegas-based Nevada Power from selling their Nevada power plants until June 2003 - and possibly until 2006.	0
Pete Ernaut, a lobbyist for Reliant Energy which has been trying to buy a power plant, said unforeseen market changes could make a plant sale before 2003 a deal that would be in the public's interest.	0
If you put a two-year moratorium on these plants, all these deals are going to go away, he said.	0
When the cow leaves the barn, it's difficult to catch.	0
Townsend had hoped to wrap up committee work on SB253 on Monday.	0
Now it's up for review again Wednesday in the Commerce and Labor Committee.	0
Reliant isn't the only company trying to keep power plant purchases alive.	0
Earlier this month, executives of Pinnacle West Energy told the committee that it's in the public's interest to allow Sierra Pacific Resources to sell its Harry Allen power plant.	0
The Harry Allen plant produces about 72 megawatts out of the 2,900 megawatts of energy that Nevada utilities generate.	0
Pinnacle has plans to expand that to 700 megawatts by 2004.	0
Other provisions not strictly related to the plant divestitures, such as ways in which Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power can recover the cost of undoing the sales contracts, don't have to be included in SB253, Townsend said.	0
Townsend said the other concerns dealing with the energy crisis and utility deregulation can be handled in later bills - but the power plant sale issue must be handled now.	0
Nevada's PUC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had directed Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power to sell the plants as a condition of the companies' merger in 1999 under the parent company Sierra Pacific Resources.	0
Critics of the plant sales say the plants generate about half the state's electricity - and if they're sold, the unregulated new owners could sell the power to other states and put Nevada into the energy dilemma California faces of shrinking supply and rising prices.	0
The Southern Nevada Water Authority has presented an analysis stating that rate payers will save from 1.7 billion to 3.5 billion by July 2001 if the power plant sales are stopped.	0
Nevada's Consumer Advocate's Office previously had projected a conservative estimate of 915 million in savings.	0
MAINE: Panel of experts would review impact of energy deregulation By GLENN ADAMS Associated Press Writer 03/19/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001.	0
AUGUSTA, Maine AP - In the wake of rolling blackouts in California and rate spikes in their home state, Maine's top legislators proposed a study Monday into the effects of deregulation of the energy industry.	0
Deregulation of electricity is a new idea and we still have a lot to learn, Senate President Michael Michaud said as he called for the analysis.	0
A panel of industry insiders, elected officials and consumers would study issues such as what standard rate consumers can expect and the likelihood of energy shortfalls over the next three years, and whether Maine consumers are vulnerable to anti-competitive activities.	0
In addition, the Blue Ribbon Commission would look into whether changes in Maine's deregulation law are needed to encourage more generating capacity, improve conservation and spur competition.	0
The study is being proposed as consumers remain mindful of a power crisis in California that resulted from high wholesale energy costs, a consumer rate cap and too few power plants in that deregulated state.	0
Maine's deregulation law is designed to avoid such pitfalls, said Rep. William Savage, D-Buxton, House chairman of the Legislature's Utilities Committee.	0
Maine's law does not cap consumer prices, as California's does, and the state has more than enough generating facilities to meet the state's energy needs, Savage said.	0
Since Maine's deregulation law took effect in March 2000, Bangor Hydro-Electric Co. rates have increased 19 percent.	0
The Public Utilities Commission approved a residential standard rate increase as recently as last month.	0
Federal energy regulators are reviewing their decision to allow steep fee increases for utilities and power wholesalers that fail to arrange enough capacity to meet customers' peak load.	0
Angus King and all four members of Maine's congressional delegation oppose the hike.	0
The PUC has approved standard rate increases for energy delivered by Central Maine Power Co. to medium-sized and large industrial users.	0
On the other hand, some towns and school districts are saving money on energy through deals they can get in the deregulated market.	0
In the meantime, legislation has been introduced in response to some of the changes that have occurred in Maine's deregulated energy industry.	0
One would use some of the money from the sale of power-generating assets to offset an increase in rates paid by large industrial users, said Sen. Norman Ferguson, R-Hanover, Senate chairman of the Utilities Committee.	0
Supporters of the utility study that was proposed Monday said they are not looking to make changes in Maine's deregulation law, but if it needs fixing it could be done during next year's session.	0
The lawmakers' primary interest is to find out how trends in a new environment designed to encourage competition will affect consumers, and to try to identify what consumers can expect in the few years ahead.	0
House Speaker Michael Saxl, D-Portland, said the Legislature has a fundamental public policy interest in making sure rate-payers and businesses are protected against exorbitant rate hikes.	0
Michaud, D-East Millinocket, said he's interested in finding out how future changes in electric prices and availability might affect businesses and consumers in northern Maine.	0
The economy in my part of the state is the most vulnerable, and I want to make certain we are leaving no stone unturned in our effort to prevent any shocks to the economy in northern, western and eastern Maine, Michaud added.	0
The commission would include House and Senate members from each party, a utility executive, and representatives of energy producers, providers, a large commercial consumer and individual consumers.	0
OREGON: State Senate moves to combat energy crisis 03/16/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001.	0
SALEM, Ore. AP - In an attempt to avoid a California-like energy crisis, the Oregon Senate approved a bill Friday that would quicken the process of siting power plants that use gas and renewable resources.	0
It's important for Oregon.	0
It makes sure that energy will be available to everyone, said Sen. Lee Beyer, D-Springfield.	0
The measure, SB843, would shorten the siting process for power plants that use gas and renewable resources, like wind, from a year and a half to a matter of months.	0
The speeded-up process would be in effect for two years.	0
If we can act now, we can actually start to solve power supply problems by this summer, said Sen. Jason Atkinson, R-Jacksonville California's strict regulations on the construction of new power plants has contributed to its current shortage and legislators took note.	0
Beyer said though California was definitely a wake-up call, the measure is a reaction to the larger power picture in the Northwest.	0
With low rainfall, hydroelectric generators will have trouble meeting demand, Beyer said.	0
Gas-fired and wind plants could come online as soon as this fall and would provide relief.	0
We are not in a position to sit back and do nothing about the energy crisis the Northwest and the country are experiencing, said Senate Minority Leader Kate Brown, D-Portland.	0
Conservationists, however, caution that lawmakers should be careful not to rush to provide power at the expense of environmental standards.	0
WISCONSIN: Two utilities to add 975 megawatts in plan to avoid energy crisis By The Associated Press 03/22/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001.	0
Plans of two state utilities to add 975 megawatts to Wisconsin's electric power grid as a way of avoiding an energy crisis similar to California's were questioned Thursday by a consumer advocate who said too many power plants may be in the works.	0
Certainly nobody wants to see blackouts like you have in California but there is the danger Wisconsin could be overbuilding, said Steve Hiniker, executive director of the Citizens' Utility Board, which represents consumer interests in utility rate cases.	0
He noted that plant construction costs ultimately are born by the utility customers.	0
Alliant Energy Corp. announced its proposal Wednesday - in a filing with the state Public Service Commission - to spend 1 billion to build one coal and two gas-fired power plants.	0
Alliant has proposed building a 500 megawatt coal-fired plant and a 100 megawatt natural-gas fired plant by 2006.	0
It also wants to build a 200 megawatt natural gas-fired facility in 2011.	0
Wisconsin has not built a coal-fired plant in more than two decades.	0
Alliant has not determined the plants' locations.	0
Also, Madison Gas & Electric, the state's smallest investor-owned utility, said Wednesday that it had signed deals to buy 175 megawatts of power from three generating plants in Wisconsin and Illinois.	0
Three out of the four past summers, we've had public appeals for conservation due to shortages somewhere in the state.	0
We need to take steps to avoid that, and the California situation makes that even more clear, said Alliant spokesman Chris Schoenherr.	0
Getting more iron in the ground will give us more flexibility in the state to be able to react.	0
Alliant acknowledged the new plants will probably mean rate increases, but it was too early to say how much rates would go up.	0
California's problems, which this week resulted in the first deliberate blackouts since World War II, stemmed from underestimating the state's power needs, forcing utilities to sell their power plants but not allowing them to secure long-term supply contracts, and freezing rates, among other things.	0
But Wisconsin's situation is far different.	0
The state has moved slower than California toward deregulation, and there has been no desire here to speed up the process in recent years as power reliability became a problem.	0
The PSC estimates that Wisconsin will need an additional 3,000 megawatts of power over the next decade.	0
Hiniker said Wisconsin needs to coordinate its planning to avoid overbuilding.	0
The costs of new power plants are passed on to ratepayers, meaning electric bills will increase as new generation is added.	0
In addition, coal-generated power plants are a major source of air pollution in the state.	0
We don't have the advance planning that has kept Wisconsin from overbuilding in the past, said Hiniker.	0
This is something the PSC should be doing.	0
MG&E's deals are: -A 10-year contract to buy 75 megawatts from Calpine Energy Services starting in May 2004.	0
The power will come from the natural gas-fired plant Rock River Energy Center, near Beloit.	0
Calpine Energy Services is a unit of San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine Energy Corp.	0
The plant is being built by Northbrook, Ill.-based SkyGen Energy LLC, which Calpine bought last year from SkyGen President Michael Polsky and Wisvest Corp., a unit of Wisconsin Energy Corp. -A 10-year contract to buy 50 megawatts of power from the Rainy River Energy Corp. starting in May 2002.	0
The power is coming from a natural gas-fired plant near Joliet, Ill. owned by LS Power Co. Rainy River is a unit of Duluth-based Minnesota Power Inc. -A five-year contract to buy 50 megawatts from an El Paso Merchant Energy plant near Cordova, Ill., in western Illinois.	0
The owner of the natural gas facility is the Cordova Energy Center Co., which is a unit of Iowa-based MidAmerican Energy Holdings.	0
Alliant also offered support in the Wednesday filing for a 7 billion plan of Milwaukee-based Wisconsin Energy, which includes five new power plants in Oak Creek and Pleasant Prairie.	0

Please note that if any information is needed in my absence you may contact Sam Smith or you may reach me at home.	0
My home phone is 713/528-3763.	0
Thanks Kevin Moore Have a Wonderful Day and Week in my absence...........	0
I think he's strong intellectually and has some influence, but I don't trust him to keep our strategy and contacts confidential.	0
Former Senator Ford knew Linda's father well plus has dinner with Linda every several weeks or so.	0
There probably isn't anyone in Washington closer to Linda than Wendell as he has known her since she was a child.	0
Andy is expecting either Steve's or Rick's phone call to further discuss the Senator's involvement.	0
Andy did discuss in general that he wasn't certain whether his client, EPSA, would go along with the strategy but he thought, overall, it was a possibility.	0
Andy's direct number is 202-828-2259.	0
I know Andy and Wendell very well and would like to be helpful as you wish.	0
However, at this point, I thought an EPSA board member i.e.	0
Steve or Rick should follow up.	0
thanks.	0
For number 2, mention that the paper was written when you were a studentt at Rice.	0
Most of the preparatory work for the class is already complete, so I don't foresee any large time commitment for this endeavor.	0
If there is a problem, let me know.	0
2 A manuscript based on my dissertation work was recently accepted for publication by ASCE Journal of Environmental Engineering.	0
I would like to use my Enron address and contact information on the work, but am unsure of company policies.	0
I can certainly default to the Rice information if there is a problem.	0

Non-affiliated competitors continue to build straw men and describe abuses with no real evidence to back them up the funny money argument and capacity hoarding are two examples.	0
The funny money argument assumes marketing affiliates will bid above market rates for capacity because they excess payment is going to the corporate bottom line.	0
Hoarding capacity to drive up price may be an issue, but it is not a marketing affiliate issue, as anyone can do it .	0
FERC staff did not seem terribly sympathetic to the points made, but at least one FERC staffer seemed to believe that one solution would be to require the pipelines to offer capacity in smaller blocks to let smaller entities put together bids.	0
FERC also indicated they were in fact auditing compliance, but in a non-public way.	0
There were some concerns voiced which I agree with and there is an opportunity to file additional comments on Apr.	0
30	0
I would like to put the following in these comments: Evidence of affiliate abuse/preference is just not there.	0
The best folks can do is make up stuff.	0
We welcome FERC monitoring if that is needed to bring confidence to the marketplace that abuse is not occurring.	0
But the issue is really whether we do have a crisis of confidence or merely a bunch of disgruntled competitors who are just seeking to neutralize the affiliated competitors .	0
The FERC rules and the information reported with a caveat under those rules are adequate for detection and enforcement and deterrence.	0
That said, the definition of marketing affiliate should be expanded to include affiliated electric generators, who are siting plants along affiliate pipelines.	0
The pipeline 637 reporting and internet systems should allow users to download and manipulate transportation related data, which is not currently the case.	0
We also need to address a deal on Northern where ENA took capacity at a discount, albeit after other parties had an opportunity to match our bid.	0
This was a deal brought up in the conference.	0
Let me know how this sounds.	1
Cutty	0
He would like to keep David on until May 15 to finish up some things he is working on for Ken.	0
Apologies if I'm being too bold	0
I'm just waiting to hear back.	0
SRS	0
Second, you spelled it incorrectly.	0
Get a clue, you idiot.	0
The calls underway.	0
I really think now is the time to speak up and dissent.	0
Skilling told us at a floor meeting that as an organization we've made poor decisions in the past, and he believes it's because the people who disagreed with those decisions never spoke up.	0
So help me out	1
I think they would do a good job.	0
Another idea: Dick Foster advisor to Enron's Board and Senior Director at McKinsey has a great book out: Creative Destruction .	0
I was on a panel with him recently where he shared some of his research.	0
He is a very good presenter; he knows Enron well; and his work is first rate.	0
He might be a good addition.	0
I have an idea on the breakout sessions.	0
It needs some work but I'd like to talk it through with you.	0
I know you have a thousand other things on your plate, not the least of which is California, so I understand if the answer is no.	0
However, they've been contacted by someone else about the date so we may be forced to decide rather soon.	0
On a related subject, I'm contemplating another topic for the conference.	0
I'd seen an article in Fortune several months ago titled Managing for the Slowdown.	0
It talked about new challenges managers face in light of the economic downturn.	0
Most young managers have never experienced anything but boom times.	0
The article also outlines a dozen or so things companies should be thinking about now.	0
Use the downturn as a new opportunity to evaluate people.	1
Overhaul your budget process.	1
Don't stop communicating.	1
etc.	0
I think it would be beneficial to address similar strategies and ideas with our managers.	0
I'd love to get your thoughts on this idea.	1
They have another inquiry about that date and wondered if Enron is still considering using Jonas.	0
If you are still considering them I will keep him on hold.	0
And if they get a firm offer I will let you know immediately.	0
We will have 24 hours to make an offer or release the hold once a firm offer comes in from another company.	0
Hope you had a great 4th of July, Alison Kravetz 800-842-4483 x239	0
I conveyed your thanks for his efforts with the US Embassy on Krishna's behalf.	0
I also had a disucssion with him on Dabhol, and will give you the details upon return.	0
The gist is that though we are unsure, 90% probability is in the direction of terminating the PPA and arbitrating.	0
Regards, Sandeep.	0

Let me know if there is anything I can do to help.	0
I have had surgery in the interior of my mouth, specifically the lower right side of my tongue.	0
My dentist had suspected cancer and sent me to an oral surgeon who biopsied the area.	0
This biopsy confirmed the dentist's opinion and off I went to MD Anderson for examination.	0
MDA was more optimistic of diagnosis but said the area needed to be excised in any event which occured at MDA last Wednesday the 11th .	0
I have been at home recovering since.	0
It has been difficult to speak although it is now much better.	0
I will return to MDA in a month for a follow-up exam.	0
Hopefully the excision was complete and no additional follow- up treatments will be necessary.	0
I have missed several critical meetings and just haven't been around but I wanted everyone to know that its not because I've lost interest.	0
Thanks for patience, Rick	0
May not be until sept 5 as ken is on vacation.	0
but there is a chance that ken will try to reach him in the meantime.	0
I'll let you know when I hear.	0
Thanks for working with Ken on the CFTC talking points.	0
Do you know if the call between Ken and Sen. Gramm occured and if there was any follow up needed.	0

I am not optimistic primarily because this is handled out of Chennai, as it must since the parents are residents of Andhra Pradesh.	0
Our earlier requests for visas from Chennai have been a very mixed bag, with us being turned down more often than not.	0
The fact of the matter is that the visa officers in the respective consulates have incredible amounts of discretion and ability to say no.	0
Once they say no, it is very difficult to reverse.	0
But I will go through our good contacts at the US Consulate in Mumbai, as this has had more success than us speaking directly to Chennai.	0
You probably remember Krishna from his visits to our Bombay office when he was helping you on a few projects.	0
A brief outline of the facts.	0
1	0
His wife is pregnant.	0
She gave birth to their daughter, Pallavi, a few years ago after a very complicated pregnancy.	0
Pallavi was a premature child and her survival was a miracle we all thank the Almighty for this wonderful child .	0
Current pregnancy is also very complicated.	0
2	0
Krishna invited his in-laws to visit and stay with them to care for his wife.	0
The application for a tourist visa was denied and the reason given for the denial was that they had overstayed the term of the visa during the previous visit.	0
The irony is that they complied with the US laws: they had asked for an extension of the visa and the extension was granted.	0
The company can, of course, intervene on Krishna's behalf.	0
Krishna made an outstanding contribution to Enron he is currently a VP and to the American society.	0
I am sure that Ken Lay would have no objections to write a letter on his behalf to the State Department.	0
I would prefer, however, to try informal channels first to avoid confrontational approach.	0
It may be better for all the involved in the long-run.	0
I hope you can use your personal contacts to intervene on Krishna's behalf and ask for a reversal of the decision on humanitarian grounds.	0
I shall fax to you a copy of the decision.	0

The reason that I share this with you is my respect for you as a CEO, a business leader and a person.	0
My wife is one of your employees who routinely shares stories about you that are nothing less than inspiring.	0
I know that during difficult times, sometimes words emerge that can help people through difficult times.	0
I believe that you are sincere man and know that you must be broken hearted, but I hope that this article can help you lead a dispirted workforce to see things more clearly.	0
My wife, Shelly Pierce, has worked for Enron for the past two years and like many of your employees, has lost a great deal of her life savings.	0
Of course, I accept most of the blame for this for reasons related to this article.	0
I lost my investment discipline and held out the false hope that Enron could not falter.	0
After reading the article to her while I was out of town, I believe that her spirit was a bit rejuvenated and she was ready to face the challenges that lay before you.	0
Mr. Lay, I appreciate the opportunity that you have given my wife and our family and hope that this story inspires you to regain your successes.	0
Its an entirely alien concept to him; he'd grown up during the greatest economic boom in modern memory.	0
His question drove home the fact that we haven't faced a severe, protracted economic setback for nearly 2 decades, leaving us terribly unpracticed at dealing with tough times.	0
With this recession - long in coming, perhaps long to stay - now officially upon us, it is imperative that corporate leaders relearn a key lesson about how great companies and great people deal with difficult times differently from how they deal with merely good ones.	0
That lesson is the Stockdale Paradox, a peculiar psychology shown by those who emerge from tough times not just intact, but stronger.	0
Adm. Jim Stockdale was the highest-ranking U.S. military officer in the Hanoi prison camp during the Vietnam War.	0
Tortured many times during his 8-year imprisonment, Stockdale lived without any prisoner's rights, no set release date and no certainty as to whether he would ever again see his family.	0
He shouldered the burden of command while fighting an internal war against his captors and their attempts to use the prisoners for propaganda.	0
At one point, he beat himself with a stool and cut himself with a razor, deliberately disfiguring himself so that he could not be put on video as an example of a well-treated prisoner.	0
He exchanged secret intelligence information with his wife through their letters knowing that discovery would mean more torture and perhaps death.	0
After his release, Stockdale became the first three-star officer in the history of the Navy to wear both aviator wings and the Congressional Medal of Honor.	0
You can understand, then, my anticipation at the prospect of spending part of an afternoon with Stockdale, who happened to be at the Hoover Institute across the street from my office when I taught at Stanford.	0
In preparation, I read In Love and War, the book he and his wife wrote to chronicle their experiences those 8 years.	0
As I read the book, I found myself getting depressed.	0
It just seemed so bleak - the uncertainty of his fate, the brutality of his captors.	0
And then it dawned on me: Here I am sitting in my warm comfortable office, looking out over the Stanford campus on a beautiful Saturday afternoon.	0
I'm getting depressed reading this, and I know that he gets out, reunites with his family and becomes a national hero.	0
I never lost faith in the end of the story, Stockdale said when I asked him.	0
I never doubted not only that I would get out, but also that I would prevail in the end and turn the experience into the defining event of my life that, in retrospect, I would not trade.	0
I didn't say anything for many minutes, and we continued the slow walk toward the faculty club, Stockdale limping and arc-swinging his leg, still stiff from repeated torture.	0
Oh, that's easy, he said.	0
The optimists.	0
I don't understand, I said, completely confused.	0
Oh, they were the ones who said, 'We're going to be out by Christmas.'	0
And Christmas would come, and Christmas would go.	0
Then they'd say, 'We're going to be out by Easter.'	0
And Easter would come, and Easter would go.	0
And then Thanksgiving, and then it would be Christmas again.	0
And they died of a broken heart.	0
After another long pause, he turned to me and said, This is a very important lesson.	0
You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end - which you can never afford to lose - with the need for discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be.	0
My conversation with Stockdale had a profound influence on me, but I never really considered it a business lesson until my research team began to wrestle with the question of why some companies rise from difficulty to become great while others emerge from those exact same difficulties weakened and dispirited.	0
We found that companies that became great embraced a corporate version of the Stockdale Paradox.	0
Fannie Mae, for example found itself in the 1982 recession losing 1M every business day, with 56B in loans under water.	0
Many analysts thought Fannie Mae, which was getting 9% on its mortgage portfolio but paying 15% on the debt it issued, was doomed.	0
But CEO David Maxwell and his team never wavered in their aim to not merely survive, but also to prevail as a great company.	0
Yes, they confronted the brutal fact that the interest-rate problem was not going to magically disappear certainly not by Christmas .	0
Instead of reacting to the recession with mindless restructuring, Fannie Mae rebuilt itself based on its answers to these questions.	0
Eventually, it generated investor returns nearly eight times those of the general stock market.	0
When asked how he dealt with the nay Sayers and the analysts who wrote Fannie Mae off, Maxwell said that it was never an issue inside the company.	0
Of course, we had to stop doing a lot of stupid things, but we never entertained the possibility that we would fail.	0
We were going to use the calamity as an opportunity to remake Fannie Maw into a great company.	0
The sad truth is that most executive teams won't respond that way to these dark days of uncertainty.	0
Instead of using this recession as an opportunity to fundamentally rethink their business and rebuild a culture of discipline, the will simply restructure, lay off a bunch of people and liquidate their cultural equity.	0
Mediocre leaders will hold out false hopes for a quick fix, only to watch those hopes be swept away by events.	0
Their companies will begin to die of a broken heart.	0
It need not be this way.	0
Those who lead with the Stockdale Paradox - those who retain the unwavering faith that they will find a way to prevail in the end, but who also retain the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of reality - will find this an ideal time to rebuild and reinforce greatness.	0
Used correctly, this recession can be a defining time in your firm's history that , in retrospect, you would not trade.	0
Used wrongly, this recession will weaken your foundations and make it that much harder to become great.	0
The choice is yours.	0

FERC bears responsibility to ensure that a workably competitive market exists before California consumers and California's economy are subjected to unconstrained, market-based electricity prices, said Governor Davis in a statement read by Energy Oversight Board Chairman Michael Kahn.	0
Consequently, I renew my prior request that the Commission act with utmost speed to intervene to the fullest extent possible to restore wholesale prices to fair levels and to remedy harms that have resulted from the exercise of market power.	0
Governor Davis noted that he and state lawmakers have taken dramatic action in recent weeks to provide rate relief.	0
While these actions should provide short-term rate predictability and longer-term benefits to customers in terms of improved supplies, the fundamental problem of exorbitant wholesale prices still exists and remains the responsibility of FERC to address, said the governor.	0
No combination of state actions can substitute for federal action to ameliorate the problems of California's wholesale markets.	0
Governor Davis has taken the following actions in reaction to rising electricity prices in San Diego: On June 14, he called for emergency reduction of electricity use by all state facilities in the San Francisco Bay area in response to electricity emergency and rolling blackouts.	0
On June 15, he called on chairpersons of the Public Utilities Commission PUC to analyze the conditions that led to electricity shortages in the San Francisco Bay area the previous day, including a statewide perspective on the price and delivery of electricity.	0
Report was completed, submitted to the governor and released on August 2.	0
On July 27, 2000, Governor Davis called on federal and state regulators to take swift action to extend the caps on wholesale electric rates in California and provide San Diego ratepayers with million of dollars in refunds.	0
In letters written by the governor to two state regulatory agencies and two California-based panels charged with overseeing California's power market, he called for a coordinated state effort to urge federal regulators to take strong measures to reduce power rates in both the short- and long-term.	0
On August 2, 2000, Governor Davis issued three Executive Orders designed to reduce energy consumption by state government and speed up the time it takes new power generating facilities to win approval from state agencies.	0
On August 9, 2000, Governor Davis called on the Public Utilities Commission PUC to establish a two-year plan that would cut electricity rates by nearly half for residential and business customers of San Diego Gas & Electric.	0
The governor also reached an agreement with the California Grocers Association that will save enough electricity to provide power to between 50,000 and 60,000 homes during periods of peak demand, as grocers agreed to reduce power consumption by 10 percent during Stage One emergencies.	0
On August 10, 2000, Governor Davis wrote a letter to President Clinton urging him to expedite FERC's investigation to determine whether current electric rates in San Diego were unjust.	0
On August 22, 2000, Governor Davis called on President Clinton to release emergency funds from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program LIHEAP to the state to help low-income Californians pay their rapidly-rising electricity bills.	0
On August 23, 2000, President Clinton responded to Governor Davis' request by releasing 2.6 million in emergency funds to help low-income Southern Californians cope with the surge in their electricity bills.	0
The President also asked federal regulators to speed up their investigation into the operation of U.S. power markets and urged the Small Business Administration to use its credit programs to help small firms hurt by the price increases.	0
On August 23, 2000, Governor Davis reached agreement with legislators on legislation to provide relief to San Diego ratepayers.	0

# # # SEPTEMBER 12, 2000 STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS TO THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION CONCERNING ITS INVESTIGATION OF WHOLESALE PRICE ESCALATION IN CALIFORNIA The Summer of 2000 has confronted California with an electricity crisis that seriously threatens the safety, health and well being of citizens and businesses throughout the state.	0
At the heart of the crisis is the extraordinary run up in prices for wholesale electric energy and ancillary services, accompanied by deteriorating service and reliability.	0
In San Diego, electric customers' bills have more than doubled this summer, threatening permanent harm to businesses and the health and welfare of residential customers in the warm southern climate.	0
All remaining California electric consumers are faced with similar prospects as their legislated rate freeze periods come to an end.	0
In San Francisco we saw rolling blackouts for the first time in our history.	0
As soon as the dimensions of the crisis became evident, I directed California regulators, including the Public Utilities Commission and the Electricity Oversight Board, and the Independent System Operator, to take immediate steps to identify and implement specific measures to mitigate the damage, including restoring price caps at Summer 1999 levels.	0
I am happy to report that those measures have been adopted, although not without considerable resistance from self-interested parties.	0
In recent weeks, I have worked with the California Legislature to enact further relief within the existing framework of options now available to the state.	0
These include provisions to stabilize retail rates, expedite generation licensing where possible, implement targeted demand reduction and demand response and remove constraints in transmission and distribution systems.	0
I have also established a task force comprised of key state officials which is developing measures to increase energy efficiency and alternative supplies and to expedite permitting by state agencies.	0
While these actions should provide short-term rate predictability and longer-term benefits to customers in terms of improved supplies, the fundamental problem of exorbitant wholesale prices still exists and remains the responsibility of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to address.	0
No combination of state actions can substitute for federal action to ameliorate the problems in California's wholesale markets.	0
A joint report submitted to me on August 2nd by the Chairman of the California Electricity Oversight Board and the President of the California Public Utilities Commission concluded that exorbitant wholesale prices in California result from wholesale market dysfunction and the exercise of market power by sellers.	0
Subsequent reports by the Market Analysis Department and the Market Surveillance Committee of the California Independent System Operator reach the same conclusions.	0
Subsequent behavior of wholesale electric prices during August confirms their conclusions, and subjects California to further economic damage.	0
While I remain hopeful that California wholesale markets may ultimately become competitive and become capable of serving the interests of consumers and the public, I cannot and will not accept the liabilities to California that result from the current situation for even a short period.	0
I intend to take any and all steps necessary to restore economic stability to the electric service infrastructure of California.	0
FERC bears the responsibility under its organic act to assure just and reasonable wholesale electric rates.	0
FERC bears responsibility to ensure that a workably competitive market exists before California consumers and California's economy are subjected to unconstrained, market-based electricity prices.	0
### OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---- A00:245 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE September 12, 2000 GOVERNOR DAVIS NAMES KAHN CHAIR OF THE GOVERNOR'S CLEAN ENERGY GREEN TEAM SACRAMENTO - Governor Gray Davis today announced the appointment of Michael A. Kahn as chairman of the newly-created Governor's Clean Energy Green Team.	0
The Team was created by Governor Davis' signing of AB 970 by Assemblywoman Denise Moreno Ducheny D-San Diego on Wednesday.	0
Mr. Kahn, 51, of San Francisco, is the chairman of the California Electricity Oversight Board, and he also serves as vice-chair of the California Commission on Judicial Performance.	0
He has been senior partner and head of litigation at Folger Levin & Kahn LLP since 1979.	0
Mr. Kahn has held numerous state and federal government appointments and assignments over the last 15 years.	0
Mr. Kahn is the author of several articles and reports on litigation practice and Supreme Court history.	0
He is a magna cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of California, Los Angeles.	0
Mr. Kahn also earned master of arts and juris doctorate degrees from Stanford University, where he was an editor of the Law Review.	0
After graduation, he served for a year as a law clerk to Judge Ben C. Duniway of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco.	0
The signing of AB 970 established the Governor's Clean Energy Green Team, which works to streamline the process of creating new power plants to ensure that an adequate supply of power will exist to make a deregulated marketplace work.	0
The Team does this by working with local governments, identifying environmental impacts, developing recommendations for low interest financing programs for renewable energy and obtaining input on natural gas supply, emission offsets and water supply.	0
Members do not receive a salary.	0
This position does not require Senate confirmation.	0

Donna sent me this quick write up about what she has looked into so far.	0
Because these questions go beyond a FERC practitioner's expertise, we asked Donna to work with a Constitutional Law expert at V&E to determine whether, and under what circumstances, the President's authority may be extended beyond the authorities discussed in the memo.	0
We will let you know what we learn from that further research.	0
I read an interesting law review article on The Imposition of Martial Law in the United States, for a discussion of presidential powers.	0
There is no general emergency authority granted the President in the U.S. Constitution.	0
Also, the article discussed the famous Truman steel mills case, Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 1952 , in which the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional President Truman's seizure of the steel mills during the Korean War.	0
In that case, in light of a threatened national-wide strike in the national steel industry, President Truman, concerned about the national defense, issued an Executive Order directing the Secretary of Commerce to take possession of most of the steel mills and keep them running.	0
The Supreme Court said that if the President had authority to take such an action, he had to derive it either from an act of Congress or the Constitution itself.	0
Since the Supreme Court could not find any seizure authority, it invalidated the President's action.	0
The Supreme Court also rejected the argument that the President had any powers that could be implied from the aggregate of his powers under the Constitution.	0
Based on the Truman steel mills case, I thought it the wiser course of action to look for specific authorities given to the President by statute which might prove useful.	0
I could look into this question further, if you would like, but we would be entering martial law-type legal territory, where the President would be acting outside of specific Constitutional or congressional authority which has been described a zone of twilight , and in light of the Truman steel mills case, I don't know how fruitful that might be.	0
Please let me know if you would like me to do anything more.	0

The first one looks ok to me as long as someone has checked the accuracy of the reference to Gas Daily.	0
I have trouble with the second one.	0
This really looks like a basis swap so I think we need to start with basis swap language.	0

"<mark>pls print for me.</mark>   <br/>---------------------- Forwarded by Drew Fossum/ET&S/Enron on 01/25/2001 <br/>07:47 AM ---------------------------<br/><br/><br/>Susan Scott<br/>01/22/2001 04:07 PM<br/>To: Drew Fossum@ENRON, Lee Huber/ET&S/Enron@ENRON<br/>cc:  <br/><br/>Subject: Termination of PG&E agreements<br/><br/>After doing some looking, I've reached the same conclusion as you, Lee:  if <br/>PG&E fails to comply with our request for assurance of creditworthiness, the <br/>""Termination"" provisions of Section 16.1(b) of our General Terms and <br/>Conditions will be triggered.  The wording is convoluted, but basically it <br/>means:<br/><br/>If PG&E fails to perform any obligation under a service agreement, TW may <br/>terminate the agreement under the following procedure:  1) TW serves written <br/>notice on PG&E that it is in default, and that TW intends to terminate the <br/>agreement, 2) PG&E gets 30 days to remedy the default, 3) if PG&E does not <br/>remedy the default within 30 days, the agreement shall become null and void.<br/><br/>3 issues + my answers:<br/><br/> 1.  Is failure to provide assurance of creditworthiness a breach of the <br/>service agreement?  I think so -- our Form M Service Agreement expressly <br/>incorporates the General Terms and Conditions of the tariff, and one of those <br/>terms and conditions is that shipper must provide satisfactory assurance of <br/>creditworthiness or TW can terminate service.<br/><br/> 2.  How should Section 16 be read in conjunction with the creditworthiness <br/>provisions of Section 13?  Section 13 provides that shipper must provide <br/>satisfactory assurance of creditworthiness within a reasonable periodor TW <br/>does not have to continue service.  I see nothing in the tariff that would <br/>prevent us from suspending service to PG&E immediately if they fail to comply <br/>with our request for assurance of payment within a reasonable time.  <br/>Simultaneously with our suspending service, we should send the letter of <br/>notice pursuant to Section 16.  <br/><br/> 3.  Is termination of service under Section 13 the equivalent of termination <br/>of the agreement under Section 16?  I do not believe our suspension of <br/>service pursuant to Section 13 would result in automatic termination of the <br/>contract, nor would it allow PG&E to just walk from the contract; it appears <br/>that either party would have to follow the procedure under Section 16 in <br/>order to terminate the contract (the notice provisions apply to shipper as <br/>well as transporter).  Section 13 does not talk about termination of the <br/>contract, only termination of service.  While I am not satisfied that this is <br/>crystal clear under our tariff, since it is not expressly stated, I do think <br/>it is the best answer given the fact that the tariff has, in Section 16, a <br/>specific procedure for terminating a service agreement.  While there is some <br/>Texas contract law on implied rescission based on mutual repudiation of the <br/>contract, I believe our tariff is controlling here because the tariff <br/>provisions I've cited amount to express contractual provisions between the <br/>parties governing termination, so there is no reason to go to common law.  <br/>Drew, in answer to your question, our termination of service is not <br/>anticipatory breach because by definition anticipatory breach is repudiation <br/>without an excuse.<br/> <br/>Now for the interesting part.  The Bankruptcy Code provides that a utility <br/>may not alter, refuse or discontinue service to a debtor solely because of <br/>commencement of a bankruptcy action or because a debt owed by the debtor was <br/>not paid when due.  However, the utility may alter, refuse or discontinue <br/>service if neither the trustee nor the debtor, within 20 days after the date <br/>of the order for relief, furnished adequate assurance of payment for service <br/>after such date.  I'm no bankruptcy expert, but my point is simply that our <br/>rights may change once a bankruptcy action is filed.  The Commission has held <br/>that termination of service cannot be inconsistent with federal bankruptcy <br/>law:  see El Paso Natural Gas Company, 61 FERC P61,302 (1992) (involving El <br/>Paso Electric bankruptcy).<br/><br/>If you need anything else, let me know.<br/><br/> Under ordinary contract law, we would probably have the right to terminate <br/>the contract if PG&E is in breach.  <br/>"	pls print for me.

There's a few <br/>additional items that need to be included.<br/>Please DO NOT include the pricing (NYMEX + .055) .  That's still being <br/>negotiated.<br/><br/>1.  Enron will warrant that we will have 15,000 of FT on Koch<br/>2. Ormet pays the demand charge ($.05) on the transport on any volumes below <br/>15,000/d<br/>3.  Volumes above 15,000/d up to 22/d will be supplied on IT.  We will <br/>utilize the same receipt/delivery path as the FT volumes in order to get the <br/>discounted transport rate.  If Koch cuts our IT, we will use best efforts to <br/>get the gas there on another path or on Cypress.  We will pass thru the <br/>actual transport costs if they are above the discounted FT rate.<br/>4.  Ormet must supply us with accurate and timely consumption information<br/><br/>5.   If Koch declares Force Majeure on our FT,  we must use best efforts to <br/>get gas and transport on Cypress before we declare FM<br/><br/>6. This is a full requirements contract (we supply all the gas that they <br/>consume)<br/>7.  If Koch's tariff changes and they go away from monthly balancing, then we <br/>will have a price re-opener.<br/>8.

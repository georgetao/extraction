Basically, Idaho got their scheduled cut by the <br/>Cal-ISO, which in turn means we have to cut our schedule flowing to Idaho. So <br/>Jeremy Morris, one of our California schedulers, cut the first Idaho deal he <br/>found and passed the remainder of the schedule to Real Time to fill, which <br/>they did in a separate deal. So EPMI and Idaho are in agreement that the <br/>schedule got cut, but that we kept them whole by selling the remainder to <br/>Idaho in the hour-ahead market. <br/><br/>Now the question is, how do we confirm the deal? From your side, is it better <br/>if we leave the deal as-is, or restore it to the original 25 mw off peak and <br/>kill the real time deal (which wouldn't really be an accurate representation <br/>of what happened)?

Instead the group's <br/>M.D. brought in two Price-Waterhouse-Coopers consultants as  V.P's to run the <br/>structuring and quant sides of the group. In this respect, I  can understand <br/>his unhappiness. Unfortunately for him, however, I also think it  is in his <br/>nature to whine.? I have observed him to bad mouth lots of people  starting <br/>with the IT guys (ok, that's perhaps not much an indictment!) all the  way to <br/>dismissing Broadie & Glasserman's or Eduardo Schwartz' works as  shoddy or <br/>shallow.? He does not seem to suffer well people he considers  fools.? Caveat <br/>Emptor, therefore! Having said all this, I do want to  emphasize that he is a <br/>bright guy, is very pleasant with me, and, perhaps given  the appropriate <br/>environment and supervision, might be quite productive.?  But don't take my <br/>word for it. Talk to him, and see what you think.?  Obviously, I would ask <br/>that you keep these comments in confidence. I have given  you an honest <br/>assessment -- brutally so.<br/>?<br/>'Nuff said! I have fulfilled my moral obligations  both to Joao and to you.<br/>?<br/>Best Regards,<br/>Grant.<br/><br/>"	Please, give him my E-mail address or the phone number.

I am the director of the MS in Computational Finance program at<br/>Carnegie Mellon.  I am following up on a conversation I had with Kevin<br/>Kindall, a graduate of our program, who gave me your e-mail address and<br/>suggested I contact you as the individual making the recruiting decisions<br/>for the Research Group at Enron.<br/><br/>In speaking with the director of the Career Opportunity Center at the<br/>business school, I am told that although an Alison Bailey from Enron<br/>(mary.alison.bailey@enron.com) has arranged for a sizable block of rooms in<br/>which to conduct interviews on campus on December 11th, there is as yet no<br/>indication of whether the Comp Finance students will have opportunity to<br/>compete for these spaces.<br/><br/>We are regarded by many in the industry as the top quantitative finance<br/>program in the country.  Focused on derivative pricing, econometrics, VAR<br/>and portfolio management, our graduates should be an excellent fit for your<br/>business.  I would be happy to talk with you further about our<br/>rogram( http://student.gsia.cmu.edu/mscf/) as well as our students' interest<br/>in Enron (the name comes up a lot!).  Also, if you are interested, we run a<br/>""Speaker Series""  on most Friday's during the fall and spring that would<br/>give you (or another in your group) the opportunity to address our students<br/>in an area of interest.  Such a meeting would, I think, help you better<br/>understand the careers our students are preparing to pursue as well as give<br/>our students first hand knowledge of Enron and its future.<br/><br/>When might be a good time to contact you by telephone?<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.<br/><br/>Rick<br/><br/>Richard L.

Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.<br/><br/>Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.<br/><br/>The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  <mark>Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.</mark><br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Jennifer Kruse	Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

How are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily <br/>average, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?<br/>[Fairley, David]  <br/>Each utility is obligated to provide the heat rate information to use in the <br/>appropriate Exhibit and the Stack Model.  As conditions change the utilities <br/>must update this info.  We are tracking heat rates based on actual fuel <br/>usage.  Services and Orig agreed yesterday to add language that requires a <br/>quarterly review of heat rate data to determine if the assumptions being used <br/>are satisfactiry -- it can never be exact, but it should be accurate within a <br/>band of acceptability.  No GADS.  Heat rates will be adjusted in the model as <br/>often as necessary to account for significant changes such as hotter ambient <br/>temps..<br/><br/>2. Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?<br/>[Fairley, David]  <br/>Yes, their units are too small.  We have discussed this with the customer, <br/>and with our internal air permit guys.<br/>[Rorschach, Reagan]  They have Title V permits, and they are faxing them to <br/>us today.  They have no run hour limitations on gas, however, they are <br/>limited on oil.  Will need to get that summary to Kay as soon as possible.<br/><br/><br/>3. We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?<br/>[Fairley, David]  <br/>We won't buy and sell fuel oil.  We may dispatch on oil at start-up, or we <br/>may switch to oil and sell the gas if profitable, which constitutes a Product <br/>transaction with the resulting profit split.<br/>[Rorschach, Reagan]  We need to state that MDEA and Cities are responsible <br/>for maintaining fuel oil supplies.<br/><br/>4. We aren't making money on gas, right?<br/>[Fairley, David]  <br/>We make money on gas two ways.  The first is outside the contract, and is <br/>basicly any internal profit on re-sale of gas to the Cities.  The second way <br/>we can make money on gas is when the gas trade is in the form of a Product <br/>trade, and those procedures apply.<br/><br/>5. Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in <br/>to the picture?<br/>[Fairley, David]  <br/>Yes, will send separately.<br/><br/>6. Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  <br/>[Fairley, David]  <br/>The Marketing Strategy, the Trading and Risk Policy, and the Description of <br/>Asset Management have been upated.  The other Exhibits have not been <br/>modified.  The Marketing Strategy and Trading & Risk Policy have been <br/>discussed at length with MDEA (MDEA commercial, not legal), and their <br/>comments/questions incorporated.<br/>  <br/> <br/><br/>7. It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the <br/>following, in words and/or formulae:<br/><br/>The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) <br/>formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to <br/>work on.  <br/>[Fairley, David]  <br/>Thought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the <br/>parties.  Will look at it again.  Conceptually, MDEA, Services Group, and <br/>Orig are in full agreement, so we need to make sure that the contract <br/>language is clear enough.<br/>[Rorschach, Reagan]  See attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example.<br/><br/> Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of <br/>power)? <br/>[Fairley, David]  <br/>There are three considerations on this: (1) who wears imbalance exposure?, <br/>(2) who manages imbalances (hourly type activity), and (3) who pays for <br/>imbalances?  Imbalances are billed by Entergy directly to MDEA under their <br/>Network Services Agreement.  EPMI's hourly desk manages the load/resource <br/>items hourly, but MDEA has the exposure (physical and price) to imbalances.  <br/>Weather/load changes, and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances <br/>(they happen, they are uncontrollable, and we fix them) which EPMI's hourly <br/>desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions <br/>and obligations of the parties.  A different section in the contract states <br/>that MDEA wears the exposure.<br/><br/> How are we setting the bogey?    Formula?   [Fairley, David]  The bogey is <br/>set when the load projection and stack models are run each day.  Both parties <br/>participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and <br/>planning the day's activities.  <br/>[Rorschach, Reagan]  Records of bogey decisions will be archieved<br/><br/>Subject to audit?  [Fairley, David]    Yes, but they would be auditing <br/>something that is jointly derived each day.  Frankly, they would like to have <br/>less involvement; ie, they trust us to do it all, but we are requiring them <br/>to participate and buy in every day.  <br/><br/>Two bogeys or one (gas and oil)?<br/>[Fairley, David]  <br/>One bogey for power.  Gas is an input for determining the bogey.<br/>[Rorschach, Reagan]  Bogey set day-ahead.<br/><br/>What is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or <br/>two would be helpful as a reality check.  <br/>[Fairley, David]  <br/>This is in the pricing calc's.  Should we have a definition?<br/><br/>What costs are included on the buy and sell side [Fairley, David]  see cost <br/>definition being provided separately.<br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/>Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used. <br/>[Fairley, David]    See definition in my mark-up's to the main agreement. <br/><br/>Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits. <br/>[Fairley, David]   Services and Orig are reviewing these, but other than what <br/>was mentioned above, probably no changes unless you see a specific area that <br/>is a problem. <br/><br/>What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split <br/>costs/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?<br/>[Rorschach, Reagan]  I will be getting exhibits of the reporting both daily <br/>and monthly.  We need to make sure to limit our info providing <br/>responsibilities to those reports.<br/><br/>It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these <br/>questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>Kay<br/><br/><br/><br/>	Please point me to the defn of profit by cutting and pasting from wherever it

Again, I will be <br/>your new contact at Enron in the above-referenced case.  You advised that <br/>Exmar, the disponent owner of the M/V SANTA CLARA, has made a demurrage claim <br/>against EGLI, who fixed the charter with Exmar, of  approximately $165,000, <br/>arising out of the loading of a cargo of propane on the ship in March of <br/>1991.  You also advised that EGLI has a counterclaim for recovery of <br/>deadfreight in the amount of approximately $150,000.  This matter has <br/>reportedly been only sporadically active over the many years since the claims <br/>were made, and is now ready to be set for an arbitration date.<br/><br/>You mentioned that Exmar's attorney had been unresponsive to your suggestion <br/>that the parties just drop their respective claims.  I understand that you <br/>feel this may be due to Exmar's attorney, rather than his client.  You <br/>further mentioned that you have read that some Enron entity is or has in the <br/>recent past entered into charters with Exmar.<br/><br/>It makes no sense for Enron and Exmar to pursue this matter further, given <br/>what you have told me.  My plan is to confirm that Enron has in fact a <br/>business relationship with Exmar that would allow us to go forward with a <br/>""drop hands"" settlement.  If you retained the publication in which you read <br/>about the recent charters, I would ask that you send it to me immediately.  <br/><mark>Since I don't yet have the file from my clients, please also send me the</mark> <br/>correct spelling of Exmar's name at your earliest convenience.<br/><br/>By copy of this e-mail, I am asking everyone who I can think of whether they <br/>know if any Enron entity has (or has had in the recent past) a ship under <br/>charter to Exmar.  If one of you can suggest other names I might check, <br/>please let me know.  I would like to put this old dog out of its misery <br/>before year end if it is humanly possible to do so.<br/><br/>Britt"	Since I don't yet have the file from my clients, please also send me the

Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.<br/><br/>Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.<br/><br/>The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  <mark>Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.</mark><br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Ellen Appell	Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

The original instantaneous settings <br/>of 8000A was too high and allowed too much current through the system that <br/>damaged the converter and caused IGBTs to blow before it tripped. The second <br/>failure was due to a QA issue with failing CB1 to trip when it was commanded <br/>to by the converter.

A question arose regarding the many <br/>operations of our breaker in the pad mounted transformer that took place <br/>December through March. Gary's thought is that when we recalculate the <br/>availability, we need to count these times as down time and not Line Out <br/>Hours as they have currently been counted. I suggested that according to <br/>Exhibit GG in the TSIA, LOH is defined in short as any time the grid does not <br/>meet ""(i) the specifications required by the WTG as set forth in the <br/>Technical Specifications"", and Gary agrees with this. The problem is that an <br/>engineering change on the breaker settings was implemented some time in March <br/>to reduce the number of breaker operations on site. We are still seeing many <br/>grid faults in the turbine but not in the PMT breaker. The question that Gary <br/>brought up is were the original settings of the breaker set to the WTG <br/>Technical Specifications and operating due to the on going grid conditions OR <br/>were the settings improper to start with causing the breaker to operate while <br/>the grid was within Technical Specifications.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"	Please answer these

OPPEL Jr. and LOWELL BERGMAN<br/><br/>03/26/2001<br/>The New York Times<br/>Page 1, Column 4<br/>c. 2001 New York Times Company<br/><br/>Early last year, the El Paso Natural Gas Company took bids from two dozen <br/>companies for the right to ship enough natural gas through its pipeline from <br/>Texas and New Mexico to meet one-sixth of the daily demand of energy-starved <br/>California. <br/>The winner: El Paso's sister company, the El Paso Merchant Energy Company, <br/>which buys, sells and trades natural gas. The bidding was not close. El Paso <br/>Merchant offered twice as much for the capacity as the other companies bid, <br/>in total, for bits and pieces.<br/>Why pay so much more? California officials, who are pressing a complaint <br/>against El Paso at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, say the answer <br/>is simple. The state contends that El Paso Merchant, with help from its <br/>sister company, saw the transaction as a way to manipulate the price of <br/>natural gas by using its control of pipeline capacity. <br/>According to sealed documents obtained by The New York Times that are part of <br/>filings in the federal case, executives at El Paso Merchant said internally <br/>that the deal would give them ''more control'' of gas markets, including the <br/>''ability to influence the physical market'' to benefit the company's <br/>financial positions. <br/>El Paso executives called the accusations fanciful, and in a formal response <br/>to California's complaint, said the state ''grossly distorted'' company <br/>documents by quoting words and phrases out of context. <br/>The dispute opens a window on an important debate about oversight of the <br/>natural gas industry, which fuels a growing share of the nation's electric <br/>power plants. <br/>At issue is whether current safeguards do enough to prevent anticompetitive <br/>abuses in the marketing and trading of natural gas, and whether federal <br/>regulators adequately enforce existing rules. In particular, many industry <br/>officials question whether regulated pipeline companies are able to favor <br/>unregulated sister companies that trade natural gas and are free to maximize <br/>profits. <br/>More than 200,000 miles of interstate pipelines crisscross the country, <br/>moving natural gas from Canada, the Southwest and other producing regions to <br/>fuel factories, power utilities and heat houses. <br/>Not long ago, many parts of the country had excess pipeline capacity. But <br/>experts say that several regions, including California, New York and New <br/>England, now face constraints as demand soars for gas to fuel power plants. <br/>In California, state officials and utility executives said the documents in <br/>the federal case, and El Paso's actions, were proof that the state's energy <br/>crisis stemmed not just from an ill-conceived deregulation plan but from <br/>price manipulation and profiteering. <br/>''They are the market maker with this pipeline,'' said Loretta Lynch, the <br/>president of the California Public Utilities Commission, which has struggled <br/>to cope with skyrocketing power prices and supply shortages. <br/>El Paso ''sets the price in California,'' Ms. Lynch said, and what it did was <br/>intentional. ''It has affected the price,'' she said, ''for everything <br/>related to heat and electrical power prices in the state.'' <br/>California's complaint to the federal agency contends that El Paso Merchant <br/>''has hoarded capacity and refused to attractively price unused capacity'' on <br/>the pipeline. The state also charges that El Paso Natural Gas, the pipeline's <br/>owner, has had no incentive to spur competition, by offering discounts to <br/>other users, because the two companies are corporate siblings. The state said <br/>that El Paso had violated federal natural gas statutes that prohibit <br/>anticompetitive behavior. <br/>The sealed filings in the El Paso case indicated that the company expected to <br/>make money by widening the ''basis spread'' -- the difference between what <br/>gas can be bought for in producing basins of Texas and New Mexico, at one end <br/>of the pipeline, and its price on delivery to Southern California. <br/>As it turned out, spreads widened enormously over the last year as the price <br/>of gas soared in California, adding to costs for wholesale electricity that <br/>pushed the biggest utilities near bankruptcy. California utilities paid $6.2 <br/>billion above competitive prices for wholesale electricity over the last 10 <br/>months, state officials estimated. The utilities are not allowed to recoup <br/>the costs from customers. While the cost of 1,000 cubic feet of gas typically <br/>is less than $1 higher at the California end of the pipeline, spot prices in <br/>the state rose to almost $50 more than the Texas-New Mexico price in <br/>December. <br/>To executives of the parent company, the El Paso Corporation, the accusations <br/>of market manipulation are ludicrous. <br/>High gas prices in California, El Paso executives said in interviews, are <br/>easily explained by soaring demand, the poor credit standing of the state's <br/>utilities and the failure of the utilities to retain pipeline capacity or <br/>store enough gas for winter. <br/>''The idea that anybody is holding back on California is really ridiculous,'' <br/>said Clark C. Smith, president of El Paso Merchant's operations in North <br/>America. <br/>Some El Paso customers, though, agreed with California officials. The Pacific <br/>Gas & Electric Company, the San Francisco-based utility, condemned El Paso in <br/>a filing with the federal agency after its lawyers reviewed the sealed <br/>company documents. <br/>''It is now very clear from the business records of El Paso Energy <br/>Corporation,'' the utility said in the filing, ''that the business strategy <br/>El Paso Merchant was authorized at the highest corporate levels to pursue <br/>involved manipulation of price spreads.'' <br/>The agency has not ruled on California's complaint, which asks that the deal <br/>between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant be invalidated. Based on the <br/>agency's history of policing energy providers lightly, many industry <br/>observers predicted that the complaint would be dismissed, perhaps as soon as <br/>the agency's public meeting on Wednesday. <br/>Nonetheless, El Paso Merchant is feeling some pressure. The subsidiary said <br/>recently that it planned to relinquish control of all but about 22 percent of <br/>the capacity on the pipeline to California, rather than exercise an option <br/>that would have allowed it to retain the entire capacity of 1.2 billion cubic <br/>feet of gas a day. <br/>Critics said they believed El Paso made the move in hopes of lessening the <br/>chance of government action. El Paso executives deny that but do say that <br/>their decision was influenced by the backlash over the arrangement. <br/>Surrendering the pipeline capacity made for a ''gut-wrenching'' decision, Mr. <br/>Smith said, but was ''a first-class gesture'' to California. El Paso Merchant <br/>paid $38.5 million to control the pipeline capacity from March 1, 2000, until <br/>May 31, 2001. While Mr. Clark said he did not know the return on that <br/>investment, he acknowledged that it was lucrative. <br/>''No doubt about it,'' Mr. Clark said, ''we made good money.'' <br/>The question of whether El Paso's conduct has driven gas prices higher is <br/>expected to be scrutinized by legislators in Sacramento this week. The <br/>company also faces several lawsuits, including one by the city of Los <br/>Angeles, that accuse it of conspiring with other companies to prevent <br/>pipeline projects that could have eased California's energy crisis. El Paso <br/>denied the accusation. <br/>With pipeline capacity and gas supplies tighter, concerns about <br/>anticompetitive behavior have increased as price volatility has created <br/>soaring profits for energy marketers and traders. <br/>Dynegy Inc., a Houston-based energy trader, was once the target of complaints <br/>to federal regulators that it had artificially raised prices by abusing <br/>capacity that it controlled on El Paso's pipeline to California. <br/>In a filing with regulators in January, Dynegy contended that pipeline <br/>companies routinely favored affiliates. ''Abuses abound because of financial <br/>windfalls, difficulty of detection, lengthy investigations and increased <br/>complexity of the market,'' the company said. <br/>''There are some red flags right now,'' said William L. Massey, a member of <br/>the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission since 1993. Mr. Massey said he was <br/>troubled by the potential for abuses when pipeline companies own gas and <br/>power marketing subsidiaries as well as electric plants fueled by natural <br/>gas. El Paso is in all those businesses. <br/>''What the commission ought to be serious about is: What are the forces at <br/>work? Is it simply robust markets responding to true supply-and-demand <br/>signals, or is it a market defined by market power and some measure of <br/>affiliate abuse?'' he said. <br/>Many in the industry do not believe changes are needed. <br/>''There are rules in place today that protect against affiliate abuse,'' said <br/>Stanley Horton, chief executive for gas pipeline operations at the Enron <br/>Corporation and chairman of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of <br/>America, the industry's trade group, referring to the rules under which <br/>California has brought its complaint about El Paso. <br/>To its critics, El Paso epitomizes the competitive concerns. It operates the <br/>nation's largest network of interstate pipelines and owns one of the largest <br/>reserves of natural gas. With its recent acquisition of the Coastal <br/>Corporation, another large pipeline operator, El Paso has a market <br/>capitalization of $32 billion. <br/>At a conference at El Paso headquarters in Houston in February, analysts <br/>heard executives predict net profits of $1.7 billion this year. El Paso's <br/>much better known rival, Enron, with its headquarters a few blocks away, is <br/>expected to earn about $1.4 billion. <br/>El Paso Merchant provides the strongest growth. Two years ago, the unit's <br/>profits, before interest payments and taxes, were $99 million; this year, it <br/>is expected to have $700 million in North America alone. In its latest <br/>quarterly report, El Paso attributed those profits, in part, to ''commodity <br/>market and trading margins'' that were enhanced by ''power price volatility, <br/>particularly in the Western United States.'' <br/>Critics contend that El Paso set out to exploit those conditions. According <br/>to the sealed filings, on Feb. 14, 2000, the day before El Paso Merchant was <br/>awarded the pipeline capacity, executives made a presentation to William A. <br/>Wise, chief executive of the parent company, laying out the rationale for the <br/>bid. <br/>The presentation outlined what it termed ''strategic advantages,'' including <br/>''more control of total physical markets'' and the ''ability to influence the <br/>physical market to the benefit of any financial/hedge position,'' according <br/>to the sealed filings. The passages suggested that El Paso expected the deal <br/>to give it sway over the market for trading actual volumes of gas and to <br/>support financial transactions it had entered into with other parties to <br/>limit its risk. <br/>For every one-cent increase in the spread on gas prices, the presentation <br/>said, El Paso Merchant stood to make an additional $2.4 million. <br/>Under the heading ''Challenges,'' according to the sealed filings, the <br/>presentation stated that storage was needed ''to help manipulate physical <br/>spreads, adding to the overall transport/storage cost.'' <br/>On April 14, according to the sealed filings, El Paso Merchant's president at <br/>the time, Greg G. Jenkins, wrote a memorandum to Mr. Wise involving an update <br/>for directors meeting later that month. The memorandum stated: ''We will make <br/>money two ways: 1) increase the load factor, 2) widen the basis spread.'' <br/>The language appears to suggest that El Paso Merchant would profit by <br/>increasing the gas flow in the pipeline -- the load factor -- while <br/>increasing the difference between what gas could be bought for at one end and <br/>what it could be sold for at the other end -- the basis spread. <br/>In an interview, Mr. Smith, the El Paso Merchant executive, said that the <br/>unit's prices, and profits, on bulk gas sales in California were locked in <br/>months in advance, so that the company could not benefit from rising prices <br/>in the spot market. <br/>Otherwise, Mr. Smith declined to provide any details about money made on the <br/>pipeline deal or about financial terms of the transactions that locked in <br/>prices ahead of time. In addition, Mr. Smith said that nearly all of El Paso <br/>Merchant's pipeline capacity was used every day when prices spiked late last <br/>year, with no capacity withheld to increase prices. <br/>The company did not respond last week to a request to discuss information in <br/>the sealed documents. But El Paso Merchant, in a filing with federal <br/>regulators, said California's complaint had ''misconstrued and incorrectly <br/>interpreted'' what it termed ''snippets of data.'' <br/>About This Report <br/>This article and others on California's energy problems are part of a joint <br/>effort with the PBS series ''Frontline'' that will result in a documentary <br/>later this year.<br/><br/><br/>Photo: The El Paso Natural Gas pipeline passes near Topock, Ariz.

A segment of electricity users n=<br/>ow=20<br/>have the right to choose their supplier from a range of marketers. The=20<br/>emergence of new marketers and generators has created the demand for price=<br/>=20<br/>risk management solutions and has encouraged the development of a traded=20<br/>wholesale market. Following the adoption of the EU Electricity Directive in=<br/>=20<br/>December 1996, member states were obliged to transpose the directive into=<br/>=20<br/>national legislation opening electricity markets to competition by February=<br/>=20<br/>1999.<br/><br/>The directive sets out a three-tiered approach to the liberalisation of=20<br/>electricity supply markets. Stage one entered into effect on 19 February=20<br/>1997, and calls for the opening of 22% of national markets, based on the=20<br/>average community share of electricity consumed by end customers using more=<br/>=20<br/>than 40 GWh per year. The degree of opening will increase over six years by=<br/>=20<br/>lowering the community consumption threshold to 20 GWh in 2000 (27% market=<br/>=20<br/>opening) and to 9 GWh in 2003 (32-33% market opening). Distributor access i=<br/>s=20<br/>a matter for each member state. The implementation of a new directive,=20<br/>expected in 2002, will improve the conditions for a liberalized market.<br/><br/>At present, the level of compliance with the directive varies between membe=<br/>r=20<br/>states. The EU countries farthest along the process of liberalisation are=<br/>=20<br/>Germany, Austria, Spain and the Netherlands. Switzerland, although it is no=<br/>t=20<br/>an EU member state, is integral to market developments. France, although=20<br/>having chosen to comply with the minimum requirements of the directive, has=<br/>=20<br/>proven to open up their market more than expected.   =20<br/><br/>Current Market<br/><br/>EDF is the dominant electricity producer in France, the largest power=20<br/>producer in the world with 475TWh generated in 2000,  and the largest=20<br/>exporter in Europe (net exports reached 71 TWh in 2000).  Power generation =<br/>in=20<br/>France is mainly nuclear (70%), but also hydro (20%), while conventional=20<br/>thermal generation represents 10%. EDF is a vertically integrated company=<br/>=20<br/>with services and products in generation (92%), supply (?%), transmission a=<br/>nd=20<br/>distribution (95%). Finally, this historical supplier is a State Entity; th=<br/>e=20<br/>French State owns EDF=01,s capital.  A few Independent Power Producers (IPP=<br/>) are=20<br/>also active in the market, such as Snet (6.4TWh, coal-fired), and CNR (16TW=<br/>h,=20<br/>hydro). Other smaller IPPs are commercially active but most must sell their=<br/>=20<br/>production to EDF under a regulated tariff.=20<br/><br/>More than 100 distribution companies are active through a concession regime=<br/>=20<br/>in their local distribution area. Few, however, are of a significant size=<br/>=20<br/>(less than a dozen have sales of over 400 GWhs), or have eligible customers=<br/>=20<br/>in their concession areas.<br/><br/>The French System Operator (RTE) was created on 1 July 2000 and is a=20<br/>sub-division of EDF, although it is unbundled in terms of management and=20<br/>accounting. A postage stamp tariff has been implemented under the=20<br/>transitional regime, which varies according to the voltage used and is base=<br/>d=20<br/>on a matrix (Summer/Winter, Peak/Off-Peak). Users have to contract for thei=<br/>r=20<br/>maximum transmission capacity. Imbalances are settled under a published=20<br/>tariff, which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a 10% tolerance=<br/>=20<br/>level and 5MW.=20<br/><br/>A three-year framework contract (e.g., by way of a Master Agreement with a=<br/>=20<br/>minimum term of three years) is required for eligible customers, but=20<br/>eligibles are free to deal for shorter maturity transactions within such a=<br/>=20<br/>three-year contractual framework. =20<br/><br/>Although the criteria for eligibility is per site, and eligible customers=<br/>=20<br/>have to contract transmission for each site, RTE has created balancing=20<br/>responsibility contracts (contrats de Responsable d'Equilibre) which compel=<br/>s=20<br/>the aggregation of imbalance charges for different eligible sites within an=<br/>=20<br/>equilibrium perimeter defined with RTE. Imbalances are settled under a=20<br/>published tariff which charges a heavy penalty for any imbalance beyond a 1=<br/>0%=20<br/>tolerance level or 5MW.=20<br/><br/>Even though we are currently under a transitional regime in France, the=20<br/>ability to trade power already exists. Optimisation can be found through=20<br/>real-time arbitrage offered by the flexibility of the industrial process, t=<br/>he=20<br/>availability of market prices and optional structures. The establishment of=<br/>=20<br/>balancing responsibility contracts has created the basic conditions for an=<br/>=20<br/>effective power trading market in France, and this through the exchange of=<br/>=20<br/>blocks from one perimeter to another. Blocs are only exchangeable on=20<br/>day-ahead bases but intra-day procedures are expected to be implemented. Al=<br/>l=20<br/>transactions are currently based on bilateral physical contracts.=20<br/><br/>The establishment of this framework has contributed to an increasing number=<br/>=20<br/>of players for trading, imports, exports and transit; we are confident that=<br/>=20<br/>the French power market will develop rapidly.     Enron Capital & Trade=20<br/>Resources Limited (""ECTRL"") is a balancing responsible actor in France and=<br/>=20<br/>closed the first physical power transaction in France early 2000, and was t=<br/>he=20<br/>very first new entrant to trade power (buy/sell) in France late 2000.   =20<br/><br/>Future Developments<br/><br/>France's size and geographical position will make it a natural hub for=20<br/>trading on the Continent. It is Europe's second largest electricity market,=<br/>=20<br/>with net consumption (including industrial on-site consumption) totalling=<br/>=20<br/>over 400 TWh in 1999. The increase of physical trading, envisaged capacity=<br/>=20<br/>release by EDF, and creation of future market mechanism will contribute to=<br/>=20<br/>the further development of the market.<br/><br/>Both a balancing market and a spot exchange market are expected to be=20<br/>implemented by end 2001. Players in the balancing market will propose put a=<br/>nd=20<br/>call options, exercised by RTE according to its own portfolio of contacts=<br/>=20<br/>(producer, consumer) and providing it with physical balancing capacity. The=<br/>=20<br/>balancing market will also show referenced market prices for balancing=20<br/>services.<br/>=20<br/>Some of the spot market volume is expected to be operated by ParisBourse.=<br/>=20<br/>However, due to the dominant position of EDF, the limited number of active=<br/>=20<br/>IPPs, existing restrictions for trading for authorised producers in France,=<br/>=20<br/>and the lack of transparency with regard to current rules for allocation of=<br/>=20<br/>cross-border capacity and attribution of congestion costs, we believe that=<br/>=20<br/>the conditions for the creation of an effective spot power market in France=<br/>=20<br/>are not yet fully met.=20<br/><br/>Recently, the European Commission has asked EDF to auction 6,000MW of virtu=<br/>al=20<br/>capacity through VPP auctions starting in September 2001, representing abou=<br/>t=20<br/>30% of the market for French eligible industrials This will further=20<br/>contribute to increase liquidity.=20<br/><br/>Regulatory Environment<br/><br/>The goal of Directive 96/92/EC concerning the internal market in electricit=<br/>y=20<br/>is to obtain a cheaper but secure electricity supply by introducing and=20<br/>gradually expanding competition while maintaining industry competitiveness =<br/>in=20<br/>the face of price decreases. France has transposed the directive, however=<br/>=20<br/>certain imperfection with regards to non-discriminatory access and the leve=<br/>l=20<br/>of liberalisation still exist.=20<br/><br/>The French Electricity law was passed on 10 February 2000, a year later  th=<br/>an=20<br/>required by the EU, establishing a transitional regime for third party acce=<br/>ss=20<br/>(TPA). Several application decrees still have to be passed, including=20<br/>transportation tariffs on the electric grid to eligible customers. The=20<br/>current threshold for eligibility is 16GWh (net of auto-consumption) per ye=<br/>ar=20<br/>and per site, and represents about 600 eligible clients and 1,200 sites.=20<br/>Eligibility for distribution companies is currently limited to the eligible=<br/>=20<br/>consumption of customers located in their concession areas. The French powe=<br/>r=20<br/>market is effectively open to some competition, and about 60 eligible=20<br/>industrials have so far switched totally or partly from the historical=20<br/>supplier. The eligibility threshold will be reduced to 9GWh per site by=20<br/>direct application of the EU Directive by Feb. 2003, as the French governme=<br/>nt=20<br/>declined a quicker opening of the power market.<br/><br/>The two main authorities, which oversee the industry, are the CRE (Commissi=<br/>on=20<br/>de Regulation de l'Electricit,) is the official regulatory body and the=20<br/>ministry of industry. The CRE is responsible to insure that RTE provides fo=<br/>r=20<br/>non-discriminatory access on to the grid and will be issuing transportation=<br/>=20<br/>tariffs.  The Ministry is responsible for providing generation licenses for=<br/>=20<br/>IPPs and for determining eligibility issues.      =20<br/><br/>RTE is implementing new capacity allocation procedures on the UK, Italy and=<br/>=20<br/>Spain interconnectors. On the remaining borders, capacity is currently=20<br/>allocated on a first-come-first served basis rule, and congestion fees are=<br/>=20<br/>levied at the margin, which favours long-term contracts and historical=20<br/>players. In addition, there is currently some lack of transparency with=20<br/>regards to RTE real-time data on the capacity available/used for exports an=<br/>d=20<br/>imports. However an intra-day market is now effective for transits, imports=<br/>=20<br/>and exports.  The first come first serve allocation rule on border capacity=<br/>=20<br/>is likely to be changed by end 2001. In addition, the CRE is likely to=20<br/>request RTE to release additional data in the months to come.  =20<br/><br/>New IPPs have to be authorised through auctions or through direct decision =<br/>of=20<br/>the Ministry of Industry, the main route for authorisation. Authorised IPPs=<br/>=20<br/>in France are limited by Decree to buying for resale to eligible customers =<br/>a=20<br/>maximum of buy for resale to eligible customers a volume equivalent to 20% =<br/>of=20<br/>the installed capacity, including long term contracts. Although the=20<br/>interpretation of this law is unclear, a recent statement by M. Tuot,=20<br/>Director General of the CRE, implies that these restrictions only apply to=<br/>=20<br/>French authorised producers and thus not to foreign-based energy companies =<br/>or=20<br/>other non-producing entities. Thus, these restrictions do not apply to ECTR=<br/>L,=20<br/>as we are not registered in France.

A segment of electricity users n=<br/>ow=20<br/>have the right to choose their supplier from a range of marketers. The=20<br/>emergence of new marketers and generators has created the demand for price=<br/>=20<br/>risk management solutions and has encouraged the development of a traded=20<br/>wholesale market. Following the adoption of the EU Electricity Directive in=<br/>=20<br/>December 1996, member states were obliged to transpose the directive into=<br/>=20<br/>national legislation opening electricity markets to competition by February=<br/>=20<br/>1999.<br/><br/>The directive sets out a three-tiered approach to the liberalisation of=20<br/>electricity supply markets. Stage one entered into effect on 19 February=20<br/>1997, and calls for the opening of 22% of national markets, based on the=20<br/>average community share of electricity consumed by end customers using more=<br/>=20<br/>than 40 GWh per year. The degree of opening will increase over six years by=<br/>=20<br/>lowering the community consumption threshold to 20 GWh in 2000 (27% market=<br/>=20<br/>opening) and to 9 GWh in 2003 (32-33% market opening). Distributor access i=<br/>s=20<br/>a matter for each member state. The implementation of a new directive,=20<br/>expected in 2002, will improve the conditions for a liberalized market.<br/><br/>At present, the level of compliance with the directive varies between membe=<br/>r=20<br/>states. The EU countries farthest along the process of liberalisation are=<br/>=20<br/>Germany, Austria, Spain and the Netherlands. Switzerland, although it is no=<br/>t=20<br/>an EU member state, is integral to market developments. France, although=20<br/>having chosen to comply with the minimum requirements of the directive, has=<br/>=20<br/>proven to open up their market more than expected.   =20<br/><br/>Current Market<br/><br/>EDF is the dominant electricity producer in France, the largest power=20<br/>producer in the world with 475TWh generated in 2000,  and the largest=20<br/>exporter in Europe (net exports reached 71 TWh in 2000).  Power generation =<br/>in=20<br/>France is mainly nuclear (70%), but also hydro (20%), while conventional=20<br/>thermal generation represents 10%. EDF is a vertically integrated company=<br/>=20<br/>with services and products in generation (92%), supply (?%), transmission a=<br/>nd=20<br/>distribution (95%). Finally, this historical supplier is a State Entity; th=<br/>e=20<br/>French State owns EDF=01,s capital.  A few Independent Power Producers (IPP=<br/>) are=20<br/>also active in the market, such as Snet (6.4TWh, coal-fired), and CNR (16TW=<br/>h,=20<br/>hydro). Other smaller IPPs are commercially active but most must sell their=<br/>=20<br/>production to EDF under a regulated tariff.=20<br/><br/>More than 100 distribution companies are active through a concession regime=<br/>=20<br/>in their local distribution area. Few, however, are of a significant size=<br/>=20<br/>(less than a dozen have sales of over 400 GWhs), or have eligible customers=<br/>=20<br/>in their concession areas.<br/><br/>The French System Operator (RTE) was created on 1 July 2000 and is a=20<br/>sub-division of EDF, although it is unbundled in terms of management and=20<br/>accounting. A postage stamp tariff has been implemented under the=20<br/>transitional regime, which varies according to the voltage used and is base=<br/>d=20<br/>on a matrix (Summer/Winter, Peak/Off-Peak). Users have to contract for thei=<br/>r=20<br/>maximum transmission capacity. Imbalances are settled under a published=20<br/>tariff, which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a 10% tolerance=<br/>=20<br/>level and 5MW.=20<br/><br/>A three-year framework contract (e.g., by way of a Master Agreement with a=<br/>=20<br/>minimum term of three years) is required for eligible customers, but=20<br/>eligibles are free to deal for shorter maturity transactions within such a=<br/>=20<br/>three-year contractual framework. =20<br/><br/>Although the criteria for eligibility is per site, and eligible customers=<br/>=20<br/>have to contract transmission for each site, RTE has created balancing=20<br/>responsibility contracts (contrats de Responsable d'Equilibre) which compel=<br/>s=20<br/>the aggregation of imbalance charges for different eligible sites within an=<br/>=20<br/>equilibrium perimeter defined with RTE. Imbalances are settled under a=20<br/>published tariff which charges a heavy penalty for any imbalance beyond a 1=<br/>0%=20<br/>tolerance level or 5MW.=20<br/><br/>Even though we are currently under a transitional regime in France, the=20<br/>ability to trade power already exists. Optimisation can be found through=20<br/>real-time arbitrage offered by the flexibility of the industrial process, t=<br/>he=20<br/>availability of market prices and optional structures. The establishment of=<br/>=20<br/>balancing responsibility contracts has created the basic conditions for an=<br/>=20<br/>effective power trading market in France, and this through the exchange of=<br/>=20<br/>blocks from one perimeter to another. Blocs are only exchangeable on=20<br/>day-ahead bases but intra-day procedures are expected to be implemented. Al=<br/>l=20<br/>transactions are currently based on bilateral physical contracts.=20<br/><br/>The establishment of this framework has contributed to an increasing number=<br/>=20<br/>of players for trading, imports, exports and transit; we are confident that=<br/>=20<br/>the French power market will develop rapidly.     Enron Capital & Trade=20<br/>Resources Limited (""ECTRL"") is a balancing responsible actor in France and=<br/>=20<br/>closed the first physical power transaction in France early 2000, and was t=<br/>he=20<br/>very first new entrant to trade power (buy/sell) in France late 2000.   =20<br/><br/>Future Developments<br/> << OLE Object: Picture (Metafile) >>=20<br/>France's size and geographical position will make it a natural hub for=20<br/>trading on the Continent. It is Europe's second largest electricity market,=<br/>=20<br/>with net consumption (including industrial on-site consumption) totalling=<br/>=20<br/>over 400 TWh in 1999. The increase of physical trading, envisaged capacity=<br/>=20<br/>release by EDF, and creation of future market mechanism will contribute to=<br/>=20<br/>the further development of the market.<br/><br/>Both a balancing market and a spot exchange market are expected to be=20<br/>implemented by end 2001.

The French powe=<br/>r=20<br/>market is effectively open to some competition, and about 60 eligible=20<br/>industrials have so far switched totally or partly from the historical=20<br/>supplier.

The CRE is responsible to insure that RTE provides fo=<br/>r=20<br/>non-discriminatory access on to the grid and will be issuing transportation=<br/>=20<br/>tariffs.  The Ministry is responsible for providing generation licenses for=<br/>=20<br/>IPPs and for determining eligibility issues.      =20<br/><br/>RTE is implementing new capacity allocation procedures on the UK, Italy and=<br/>=20<br/>Spain interconnectors. On the remaining borders, capacity is currently=20<br/>allocated on a first-come-first served basis rule, and congestion fees are=<br/>=20<br/>levied at the margin, which favours long-term contracts and historical=20<br/>players. In addition, there is currently some lack of transparency with=20<br/>regards to RTE real-time data on the capacity available/used for exports an=<br/>d=20<br/>imports. However an intra-day market is now effective for transits, imports=<br/>=20<br/>and exports.  The first come first serve allocation rule on border capacity=<br/>=20<br/>is likely to be changed by end 2001. In addition, the CRE is likely to=20<br/>request RTE to release additional data in the months to come.  =20<br/><br/>New IPPs have to be authorised through auctions or through direct decision =<br/>of=20<br/>the Ministry of Industry, the main route for authorisation.

Although the=20<br/>interpretation of this law is unclear, a recent statement by M.

Thus, these restrictions do not apply to ECTR=<br/>L,=20<br/>as we are not registered in France.

In the view of the transposition of  the EU=20<br/>Electricity Directive into French law, this purchase obligation ceased to=<br/>=20<br/>apply for new large projects (over 12MW) from 1st Jan. 1999.<br/>More than 100 distribution companies are active through a concession regime=<br/>=20<br/>in their local distribution area. Few, however, are of a significant size=<br/>=20<br/>(less than a dozen have sales of over 400 GWhs), or have eligible customers=<br/>=20<br/>in their concession area.<br/><br/>2) Regulatory Environment<br/><br/>The French Electricity law was passed on 10 February 2000, implementing=20<br/>regulated third party access (TPA) in France under a transitional regime. T=<br/>he=20<br/>law was approved one year late, failing to meet the required EU deadline.=<br/>=20<br/>Dozens  [""Dozens""  - I would replace this with ""Several"")  of application=<br/>=20<br/>decrees still have to be passed, including tariffs to eligible industrials.=<br/>=20<br/>The French power market is open to competition, however. About 60 eligible=<br/>=20<br/>industrials have so far switched totally or partly from the historical=20<br/>supplier. Current threshold for eligibility is 16GWh (net of=20<br/>auto-consumption) per year and per site, representing about 600 eligible=20<br/>clients and 1,200 sites. The eligibility threshold will be reduced to 9GWh=<br/>=20<br/>per site by direct application of the EU Directive in Feb. 2003, as the=20<br/>French government declined a quicker opening of the power market.<br/><br/>Eligibility of distribution companies is limited to the eligible consumptio=<br/>n=20<br/>of customers located in their concession area. =20<br/>A three-year framework contract ( e.g., by way of a Master Agreement with a=<br/>=20<br/>minimum term of three years) is required for eligible customers, but=20<br/>eligibles are free to deal for shorter maturity transactions within such a=<br/>=20<br/>three year contractual framework. =20<br/><br/>New IPPs have to be authorised through auctions or through direct decision=<br/>=20<br/>from the Ministry of Industry, which is the main route for authorisation.=<br/>=20<br/>Authorised IPPs in France are limited by Decree to trading buy for resale t=<br/>o=20<br/>eligible customers a volume equivalent to 20% of the installed capacity,=20<br/>including long term contracts. Trading is currently defined as the conditio=<br/>ns=20<br/>of power purchase for resale to eligible customers. These Trading=20<br/>restrictions, however, do not apply to ECTRL, as we are not registered in=<br/>=20<br/>France. IPPs are free to sell and export power.<br/><br/>The French System Operator (RTE) was created on 1 July 2000 and is a=20<br/>sub-division of EdF, although it is unbundled in terms of management and=20<br/>accounting. A postage stamp tariff was implemented under the transitional=<br/>=20<br/>regime, which varies according to the voltage used,and which is based on a=<br/>=20<br/>matrix (Summer/Winter, Peak/OffPeak). Users have to contract transmission u=<br/>p=20<br/>to the maximum capacity that they will use. RTE purchases excess capacity=<br/>=20<br/>available through transmission contracts at fixed prices, which represents=<br/>=20<br/>about half of the market price. Imbalances are settled under a published=20<br/>tariff, which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a 10% tolerance=<br/>=20<br/>level and 5MW. Although the criteria for eligibility is per site, and=20<br/>eligible customers have to contract transmission for each site, RTE has=20<br/>created programme responsible contracts (contrats de Responsable=20<br/>d'Equilibre), which allow the aggregation of imbalance charges for differen=<br/>t=20<br/>eligible sites within an equilibrium perimeter defined with RTE.<br/><br/>Eligible customers, who are physically connected to the Grid, have to=20<br/>contract for transmission vis-.-vis RTE (Contrat Made). Traders, such as=20<br/>ECTRL, are not required to have such a transmission contract, as they do no=<br/>t=20<br/>consume the power they purchase. Only a programme responsible contract=20<br/>coupled with grid access contracts (import, export, and/or transit) are=20<br/>required by RTE. =20<br/><br/>A new Decree is expected to be passed by Summer 2001, setting up new=20<br/>conditions for transmission, transits and exports under a permanent regime.=<br/>=20<br/>It is likely that this new tariff will implement a 1/3 injection-2/3 delive=<br/>ry=20<br/>calculation factor. Imports, which are allocated on a pro-rata basis, are=<br/>=20<br/>free of transmission charges. =20<br/><br/>Programme responsible contracts have established the basis of trading in=20<br/>France through the exchange of blocs from one perimeter to another.  Enron=<br/>=20<br/>Capital & Trade Resources Limited (""ECTRL"")  is programme responsible in=20<br/>France. Cross border capacity is currently allocated on a first-come-first=<br/>=20<br/>served basis rule by RTE, and congestion fees are levied at the margin, whi=<br/>ch=20<br/>favours long term contracts and does not give equal treatment to all player=<br/>s.=20<br/>In addition, there is currently some lack of transparency with regards to R=<br/>TE=20<br/>real-time data on the capacity available/used for exports and imports. This=<br/>=20<br/>allocation rule is likely to change by end 2001. In addition, the CRE is=20<br/>likely to request RTE to release additional data in the months to come.  =<br/>=20<br/><br/>The CRE (Commission de Regulation de l'Electricite) is the offical regulato=<br/>ry=20<br/>body, which mainly covers TPA and tariff issues, while IPP licenses and=20<br/>eligibility issues are covered by the Ministry of Industry.      =20<br/>      =20<br/>3) Business Opportunity<br/><br/>Although we are currently under a transitional regime in France, the abilit=<br/>y=20<br/>to trade power already exists. Optimisation can be found through real-time=<br/>=20<br/>arbitrage between the flexibility of the industrial process, market prices=<br/>=20<br/>and optional structures. The establishment of programme responsible contrac=<br/>ts=20<br/>has created the basic conditions for an effective power trading market in=<br/>=20<br/>France. ECTRL closed the first physical power transaction in France early=<br/>=20<br/>2000, and was the very first new entrant to trade power (buy/sell) in Franc=<br/>e=20<br/>late 2000. =20<br/><br/>An intraday market is now effective for transits, imports and exports, and =<br/>is=20<br/>expected to soon be extended to exchange of blocs in France.=20<br/>Liquidity has been dramatically increasing (although the market remains=20<br/>dominated by the historical player) thanks to RTE capacity auctions for=20<br/>(auction has not been implemented on Spanish side yet) [QUERY: do we need=<br/>=20<br/>this bit in brackets??

Players in the balancing market will propose put a=<br/>nd=20<br/>call options, which will be exercised by RTE according to its own portfolio=<br/>=20<br/>of contacts (producer,consumer), thus providing RTE with physical balancing=<br/>=20<br/>capacity. The balancing market will also show referenced market prices for=<br/>=20<br/>balancing services.=20<br/><br/>The Some of the spot market volume is expected to be run by ParisBourse.=20<br/>However, due to the dominant position of EdF, the limited number of active=<br/>=20<br/>IPPs, existing restrictions for trading for authorised producers in France,=<br/>=20<br/>and the lack of transparency with regard to current rules for allocation of=<br/>=20<br/>cross-border capacity and attribution of congestion costs, we believe that=<br/>=20<br/>the conditions for the creation of an effective spot power market in France=<br/>=20<br/>are not yet fully met. ECTRL has actively been lobbying in order to have fa=<br/>ir=20<br/>and transparent rules implemented for every player in the market and has=20<br/>actively contributed for a spot market to take place.<br/><br/>However, thanks to an increasing number of players in France for trading,=<br/>=20<br/>imports, exports and transit, we are confident that the French power market=<br/>=20<br/>will develop rapidly.        =20<br/><br/>5) The Gas Market Situation<br/><br/>A transitional regime was implemented on 10 August 2000 by direct applicati=<br/>on=20<br/>of the EU Directive, thus establishing regulated TPA for sites whose=20<br/>consumption is over 25 million cubic meters p.a. The eligibility threshold=<br/>=20<br/>will be reduced to 15million cubic meters in 2003, and 5 million cubic mete=<br/>rs=20<br/>in 2008. No gas law has been passed yet (forecasted mid 2002), and its is=<br/>=20<br/>expected that the transitional regime for gas in France will last until end=<br/>=20<br/>2002. A zonal/distance-related tariff was disclosed published on 13 July 20=<br/>00=20<br/>by GdF-Transportation. A permanent entry/exit tariff structure is likely to=<br/>=20<br/>be developed for 2003.  Charges  for imbalances are expensive, and access t=<br/>o=20<br/>storage is restricted. GdF-Trading, however, has published conditions for=<br/>=20<br/>balancing services.=20<br/>There is only one trading Hub for France located at the French/Belgian bord=<br/>er=20<br/>(Blaregnies/TaisniSres). Due to the distance-related nature of the=20<br/>transportation tariff, competitive TPA is limited to eligible sites which a=<br/>re=20<br/>located not too far (less than about 250Km) from the French/Belgian border.=<br/>=20<br/>The main imports into France are for high cal gas, and GdF has published th=<br/>e=20<br/>conditions for high cal/low cal gas swaps.<br/>As there is not yet a  [new??] gas law in France ( a Projet de Loi was=20<br/>approved on 17th May 2000) transposing the EU Gas Directive into domestic=<br/>=20<br/>legislation, the Regulatory Commission has not been appointed to-date , and=<br/>=20<br/>the official regulatory body remains the Ministry of Industry.   =20<br/>Although current conditions do not facilitate full requirement supply to=20<br/>customers from new entrants, it is already possible to optimise gas supply=<br/>=20<br/>through import of blocs for part or full supply.

EdF's only real argument is that=20<br/>phasing will allow more new suppliers to enter at a later date as eligiblit=<br/>y=20<br/>threshold drops in France.

Thanks for your note.  It is my<br/>understanding that when the ISDA Credit Support Annex<br/>was first drafted, the drafters had a couple of<br/>concerns about transfers so they addressed each concern<br/>differently.  The minimum transfer amount is used to<br/>avoid de mininimus transfers (remember that the<br/>original participants were all banks and finance houses<br/>doing large dollar deals together with daily marking to<br/>market).<br/><br/>The drafters provided the option of rounding to avoid<br/>conflicts as to what the transfer amount should be.<br/>The original thought probably was to set rounding<br/>limits quite high so that even if Party A and Party B<br/>had different numbers, the rounding would be large<br/>enough to avoid disputes.<br/><br/>You may recall that I used an example of one party<br/>calculating that the delivery amount should be $1.6<br/>million and the other calculating a delivery amount of<br/>$1.8 million.  If rounding is up in integral units of<br/>$500,000, the transfer would be for $2 million, thus<br/>avoiding the conflict.<br/><br/>Some parties choose to use either minimum transfer<br/>amount or rounding--but not both.  When parties use<br/>both, they should examine whether the numbers they have<br/>chosen for rounding don't interfere with minimum<br/>transfer amount and vice versa. Many times, an<br/>otherwise due transfer isn't made because the rounding<br/>or minimum transfer numbers effectively change the<br/>transfer amount.<br/><br/>Rounding needn't be less than half of the minimum<br/>transfer amount.  Parties should understand, though,<br/>that either can interfere with a transfer otherwise<br/>due.  If you have further questions, please advise.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Quoting Harry Wijsman <Harry_Wijsman@pancanadian.ca>:<br/><br/>> Ann,<br/>><br/>> I attended and enjoyed your recent class on the above<br/>subject in<br/>> Calgary.<br/>><br/>> During this class you mentioned a most effective<br/>stucture under<br/>> parargraph 13(b)(iv) Thresholds was to have the<br/>""minimum transfer<br/>> amount"" set at twice the amount of the ""rounding "".<br/>You provided an<br/>> explanation of this structure which I did not<br/>understand or write down.<br/>><br/>> Can you please provide me with this detailed<br/>explanation again by return<br/>><br/>> E-mail.<br/>><br/>> Your assistance is most appreciated.

Alternatively, will you need to <br/>check the data real-time, perhaps at varying and multiple times during the <br/>day? <br/>c)  We will be installing this station near Sacramento, California:  We will <br/>need to know exactly what areas in/near Sacramento are suitable for the site <br/>of the weather station.  (What again was the name of the town that you <br/>mentioned Mark?)  In the interest of time, I recommend that your weather <br/>expert accompany our landman to select the site, which will allow our landman <br/>to more quickly lease and install the station.<br/>d)  You desire to have some independent security measures to deter or detect <br/>tampering. I suggest given the very short time fuse, that we first install <br/>the station and then develop security measures.<br/>e)  We will feed the data directly to the Enron weather desk.

The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which <br/>current unpaid invoices due total $37,325.<br/><br/>Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this <br/>project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design <br/>and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of <br/>our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or <br/>rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? <br/><br/>Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a <br/>percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on <br/>your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, <br/>or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the <br/>second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per <br/>year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these <br/>valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the <br/>forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in <br/>the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future <br/>projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per <br/>month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the <br/>attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings <br/>the total net buyout to $78,946.? <br/><br/>We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we <br/>offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout <br/>offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are <br/>prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? <br/>If this is your <br/><br/><br/><br/>choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, <br/>Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then <br/>draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the <br/>Bishops Corner, Ltd.

"<mark>pls print for me.</mark>   <br/>---------------------- Forwarded by Drew Fossum/ET&S/Enron on 01/25/2001 <br/>07:47 AM ---------------------------<br/><br/><br/>Susan Scott<br/>01/22/2001 04:07 PM<br/>To: Drew Fossum@ENRON, Lee Huber/ET&S/Enron@ENRON<br/>cc:  <br/><br/>Subject: Termination of PG&E agreements<br/><br/>After doing some looking, I've reached the same conclusion as you, Lee:  if <br/>PG&E fails to comply with our request for assurance of creditworthiness, the <br/>""Termination"" provisions of Section 16.1(b) of our General Terms and <br/>Conditions will be triggered.  The wording is convoluted, but basically it <br/>means:<br/><br/>If PG&E fails to perform any obligation under a service agreement, TW may <br/>terminate the agreement under the following procedure:  1) TW serves written <br/>notice on PG&E that it is in default, and that TW intends to terminate the <br/>agreement, 2) PG&E gets 30 days to remedy the default, 3) if PG&E does not <br/>remedy the default within 30 days, the agreement shall become null and void.<br/><br/>3 issues + my answers:<br/><br/> 1.  Is failure to provide assurance of creditworthiness a breach of the <br/>service agreement?  I think so -- our Form M Service Agreement expressly <br/>incorporates the General Terms and Conditions of the tariff, and one of those <br/>terms and conditions is that shipper must provide satisfactory assurance of <br/>creditworthiness or TW can terminate service.<br/><br/> 2.  How should Section 16 be read in conjunction with the creditworthiness <br/>provisions of Section 13?  Section 13 provides that shipper must provide <br/>satisfactory assurance of creditworthiness within a reasonable periodor TW <br/>does not have to continue service.  I see nothing in the tariff that would <br/>prevent us from suspending service to PG&E immediately if they fail to comply <br/>with our request for assurance of payment within a reasonable time.  <br/>Simultaneously with our suspending service, we should send the letter of <br/>notice pursuant to Section 16.  <br/><br/> 3.  Is termination of service under Section 13 the equivalent of termination <br/>of the agreement under Section 16?  I do not believe our suspension of <br/>service pursuant to Section 13 would result in automatic termination of the <br/>contract, nor would it allow PG&E to just walk from the contract; it appears <br/>that either party would have to follow the procedure under Section 16 in <br/>order to terminate the contract (the notice provisions apply to shipper as <br/>well as transporter).  Section 13 does not talk about termination of the <br/>contract, only termination of service.  While I am not satisfied that this is <br/>crystal clear under our tariff, since it is not expressly stated, I do think <br/>it is the best answer given the fact that the tariff has, in Section 16, a <br/>specific procedure for terminating a service agreement.  While there is some <br/>Texas contract law on implied rescission based on mutual repudiation of the <br/>contract, I believe our tariff is controlling here because the tariff <br/>provisions I've cited amount to express contractual provisions between the <br/>parties governing termination, so there is no reason to go to common law.  <br/>Drew, in answer to your question, our termination of service is not <br/>anticipatory breach because by definition anticipatory breach is repudiation <br/>without an excuse.<br/> <br/>Now for the interesting part.  The Bankruptcy Code provides that a utility <br/>may not alter, refuse or discontinue service to a debtor solely because of <br/>commencement of a bankruptcy action or because a debt owed by the debtor was <br/>not paid when due.  However, the utility may alter, refuse or discontinue <br/>service if neither the trustee nor the debtor, within 20 days after the date <br/>of the order for relief, furnished adequate assurance of payment for service <br/>after such date.  I'm no bankruptcy expert, but my point is simply that our <br/>rights may change once a bankruptcy action is filed.  The Commission has held <br/>that termination of service cannot be inconsistent with federal bankruptcy <br/>law:  see El Paso Natural Gas Company, 61 FERC P61,302 (1992) (involving El <br/>Paso Electric bankruptcy).<br/><br/>If you need anything else, let me know.<br/><br/> Under ordinary contract law, we would probably have the right to terminate <br/>the contract if PG&E is in breach.  <br/>"	pls print for me.

Enron will warrant that we will have 15,000 of FT on Koch<br/>2. Ormet pays the demand charge ($.05) on the transport on any volumes below <br/>15,000/d<br/>3.  Volumes above 15,000/d up to 22/d will be supplied on IT.  We will <br/>utilize the same receipt/delivery path as the FT volumes in order to get the <br/>discounted transport rate.  If Koch cuts our IT, we will use best efforts to <br/>get the gas there on another path or on Cypress.  We will pass thru the <br/>actual transport costs if they are above the discounted FT rate.<br/>4.  Ormet must supply us with accurate and timely consumption information<br/><br/>5.   If Koch declares Force Majeure on our FT,  we must use best efforts to <br/>get gas and transport on Cypress before we declare FM<br/><br/>6.

Contract #63281 was over-run and Storage #51407 was over-withdrawn. <br/>Contract over-run is $.21 per dkt and storage over-withdrawls are $10 per dkt.<br/><br/>Because the forecast was lower, I let Joann use the extra space for CES <br/>Enduser Market. TCO will let me cut gas to CES Enduser Markets as a retro. <br/>Not sure if you want this gas to flow or try to make it up over the weekend. <br/>If you need the gas to flow because of OFO penalties, maybe the storage <br/>over-withdrawal is cheaper than incurring OFO penalties. Please tell me what <br/>you want me to do. Need to do the retro's ASAP while TCO is still feeling <br/>generous.<br/><br/>FYI, the traders at Enron talked to Noel Bartlo on Tuesday. Noel said any <br/>costs over the space that retail had (134,710 for choice), Enron had the <br/>right to pass on the costs. I really hope the Noel communicated that to CES <br/>Retail. I would hate to have a huge misunderstanding between Enron and CES <br/>Retail. Remember, we schedulers are caught in the middle... and don't try to <br/>cause unnecessary pain.<br/><br/><br/>63281/236 coh 7-1  2934/2872<br/>63281/170 coh 7-5  1922/1881<br/>63281/99 coh 5-2  427/418<br/>63281/221 cpa8-35 1639/1604<br/>63281/220 cpa8-35 511/500<br/><br/>Total    7433/7275<br/><br/>	Kara/Heidi, please give this to Brian and Melissa.

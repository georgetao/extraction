I would like to ask all of you if you have any objections to being named in the will as executors OR executing an Advanced Health Care Directive.
An AHCD is document inwhich Diane and I will state what our wishes are regarding life support.
I have attached a sample copy for review.

I live in Garden Oaks which is located off of the North Loop between Shepherd and Yale near the Heights .
"Our neighborhood was built in the early 's, and the city put in open drainage which is basically ditches in the front of all the properties ."
"Over the past years the drains have filled in and leveled which is preventing the water from flowing correctly to the sewers, and this in turn causes minor flooding and BIG headaches."
"My address is W. th Street and the area of th Street I am asking the city to regrade is between Ashland and Yale approximately , feet ."
I have been calling the City of Houston Public Works Department - - for about the last years generally once a month to ask them to please come out and regrade our ditches.
The Public Works Department only has records over the last year because they changed their computer system and lost many files including mine.
For the last year or so I have been receiving a more positive response when I call which is: This is a Code priority and will schedule as work load allows.
"Although this response is encouraging, I still feel that my request is falling on deaf ears."
Kevin suggested that perhaps a call or letter to a city council person might help expedite this work request.
I would be extremely grateful if there is anything you could do to help me and my neighbors.

Melissa loves talking about Houston real estate one of the many quirks I love her for .
I'll find out when she can do it.
I really did not have to discuss about moving to Houston.
The conversation was more around when and how.
On Friday I have to be in Houston for an EBS meeting on Mexico.
"I am planning to arrive there on Thursday morning to talk to Rick, to Dan Reck and to Shawn Cumberland."
"I also need to find out about relocation and visas , etc."
I am writing you to thank you for your generosity in your advice and for helping me and encouraging me in making this important decision.
I am also wirting because I am taking your word on Melissa's knowledge of the real estate market inside the loop.
"Elsa is coming with me on Thursday morning and we would like to see if it is possible for us to meet with Melissa on Thursday, Friday or Saturday for advice and orientation."
Of course you would be welcome to the real estate working session
Please let me know.
"Thanks again, Ricardo"
"I'd love to see the General and you of course , but I'm going to have to pass."
Thanks anyway.
The guest speaker this year will be General Norman Schwarzkof.
Please contact Cathy Phillips X- and let her know if you are interested in attending.
Thank you.

You can inform them that they should keep the books in stock and probably order a few more copies.
I am in London right now and will stay here for a few more days.
Swamped with work as usual.
I was on the road for the last weeks.
The tropical storm unleashed the fury on my neighborhood inches in one night but we survived without major problems.
The only problem I had was an overflowing swimming pool it took minutes to go from a comfortable slack to a full condition .
We've been in contact with Rice University's bookshop and they informed us that they have a few books left over from the course.
We told them originally that if they didn't sell them all we would take them back.
Hope that the storm didn't cause you any problems.

I've been unable to contact him directly.

Enron is moving right along and we will find out about who I am working for on Friday our auction should be completed then .
Not too much else is new.
"My place continues to get better as I slowly furnish it , but Portland continues to be the little sister to Seattle."
A couple new bars in town suggest she might be getting closer to puberty but definitely not the woman about town that Seattle is.
And I hope you are the only one reading this if it is not .
"If that is the case, well, we can see what we can do about it."
"As always, I have no plans the next couple weekends, so give me a shout still have my cell phone at - - if you want to take a trip on down."
"Your always welcome to crash on my couch... sorry its all I have, I got rid of the futon ."
Hope youre doing well.

I hope everything is well with you.

Who would have guessed that the California power crisis and Gray Davis could be so funny.
"Kevin Los Angeles Daily News Friday, June , 'Tonight Show' pokes fun at power crisis By Fred Shuster Staff Writer BURBANK -- Jay Leno pulled the plug on his late-night chat show Thursday, doing his part for the state's energy crisis, but viewers weren't left in the dark."
"Flashlights, mining helmets and multicolor glow sticks helped to illuminate the set for the show dubbed a one-time-only The Tonight Show Unplugged, which Leno said saved enough electricity to light a house for a month."
IMAGE The unplugged edition of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno pokes fun at the California power crisis Reed Saxon A.P.
Call it NBC's Can't See TV.
This is not some cheap rating ploy.
"If this works, they're gonna make us do this every night, Leno joked as part of his opening monologue."
"The nationally broadcast show, featuring a comic interlude with California Gov."
"Gray Davis, utilized just a small amount of electricity to run the cameras, Leno said before the show began."
"Actually, in Burbank, where the taping took place at NBC Studios, the city owns the power company and residents and businesses have not been hit by rolling blackouts as in other areas."
The city made million in profit in May after racking up million in excess power sales.
"But Leno said not using studio lights, TV monitors, amplifiers and other power sources Thursday saved enough electricity to light a four-bedroom house for a month."
"Members of the house band wore miner's helmets, with group leader Kevin Eubanks strumming an acoustic guitar rather than his regular electric instrument."
"The stage was lit by candles, torches and flashlight beams trained on Leno."
Members of the studio audience used the gear to help brighten the set.
"This is real goofy, Leno said before taping got under way."
We'll see what happens.
"Guests included Arsenio Hall, Gilbert Gottfried, a trainer of nocturnal animals and a Hawaiian fire dancer -- and a brief visit from the governor."
"Exuding whatever is the direct opposite of charisma, Davis had a brief exchange with Leno, drawing laughs with the line, This is the first time Gray Davis and the word electricity have ever appeared in the same sentence."
Leno's staff wore glasses with small lights attached and audience prompter Bob Perlow held a hand-scrawled applause sign aloft throughout the show instead of switching on the usual electric model.
"While there was little energy in play, there was no shortage of laughs."
"Leno joked that President George W. Bush told Davis not to worry because, I've been operating in the dark for years."
Those in the studio said Leno's nocturnal transmission added excitement to the program.
"It was cool, said Lillie Harrell, , a tourist from Hammond, La."
The crowd got really involved.
I guess it shows you don't really need all those lights.
"Added Jose Tano, , a Burbank resident and student at the University of California, Los Angeles, It was a good idea and a great way to make a point."
"The local power company might not have made out very well, but the studio audience didn't end up empty-handed."
Each received a fluorescent lantern and pack of batteries as they left the studio.
I particularly recommend mistakes and mediocrity.
"I'm sorry to clog up your email in boxes, but I found the attached to be pretty interesting."

concessions we sought\", \"As you'll recall these were a to get the BLM to withdraw any interim policies the first of which split fiber cables into different ROW certifications and a later version that re packaged the issue mandating that ROW certificates be issued each time a fiber owner subleases or sells capacity on its line with a retroactivity clause that added extra sting b to get the Forest Service to retract its May nd memorandum which changed its fiber optic ROW policy from published fee schedules to individual comparable assessments the first such assessment which compared ROW fees in urban centers in downtown Portland and Seattle to Oregon forest lands increased the cost of a segment of our FTV fiber build fold c to block both agencies from implementing any proposed or final rule in FY and d to create an open rule making process that involves all interested stakeholders including Enron\", 'Thanks to the considerable pressure we orchestrated from Congress and the Administration BLM Director Fry and USFS Chief Dombeck have backed away from points a and b above and have agreed to points c and d The language we inserted in the Interior Appropriations Bill which has been agreed to by the Conferees forces both agencies to revert back to the published fee schedules prevents them from implementing any new policies in FY and forces them to work with industry and to come up with a common policy for future rent determination', \"The reference in the opening sentence to gravitationally challenged women is because the issue still hasn't quite closed\", 'The Interior Appropriations Bill may very well be vetoed', \"But since our issue was settled at the staff level and is now off the table we're likely to remain safe from being re examined and challenged\", 'In fact any changes would likely only increase the strength of our hand some members of our coalition are trying to insert even more detailed language in the report that prescribes exactly how the agencies will proceed to determine the new rental fee schedules over the next months', \"Through outside consultants we've had a series of constructive discussions with the agencies over the past two weeks that have forged agreements on timing and specific ways forward\", 'Details are forthcoming but Enron would be involved closely in the process', 'The agencies were clearly surprised by the clout we wielded and are now more than willing to negotiate', 'But the bottom line again is that we have stopped both agencies from implementing their costly interim policies or launching a rule making process either now which they originally intended to do or in the coming fiscal year', \"And by engaging key Members of Congress and the White House and organizing and leading

the USG wants to be on record politically encouraging the Indian Govt', 'to engage in discussions all parties consider to be meaningful in hopes of working things out before it is too late even while through OPIC and EXIM it is supporting the move towards PNT', 'The administration may be concerned that without such a diplomatic overture on its part it could be concluded that the USG has politically taken a position on the project', 'In Trakya for example the USG has been quite proactive in pressing the Turkish govt on the payments issue and even in discussing the payment concerns with the IMF so that the payments issues for the BOTs two of the four in Turkey are US sponsored are taken into account as the IMF program moves forward', 'So I anticipate that the USG will shortly be

section Critics Say U S Energy Agency Is Weak in Oversight of Utilities By JEFF GERTH and JOSEPH KAHN The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company WASHINGTON March The pressure was intense when federal regulators met privately last month to debate remedies for soaring electricity prices in California', \"Officials of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the agency whose mandate is to ensure ''just and reasonable'' electricity rates nationwide had evidence that a few companies had been selling electricity to California at prices far above the cost of generating it\", 'The agency faced an imminent deadline to challenge those prices or let the companies possibly pocket hundreds of millions of dollars in unfair profits', 'An internal memorandum laid out two choices', \"The agency could audit and punish ''bad actors '' the companies that were exploiting the market\", \"Or it could identify ''bad hours '' when electricity shortages were most acute and spiking prices were arguably nobody's fault and order refunds for only the most exorbitant prices\", \"''It may be easier to identify bad hours than bad actors '' the memorandum said\", 'The commission took the easier way', \"It decided not to investigate reports of abuses by companies but issued an order that could require them to refund to the state utilities up to million collected during a relatively few ''bad hours'' in January and February\", \"That is hundreds of millions of dollars less than California might have claimed since the most potential overcharging occurred during ''good hours '' when power was more plentiful but prices were often just as extreme\", 'The order ignored those hours', \"Today in a criticism of the agency's lack of aggressiveness California regulators estimated that generators had charged billion above competitive levels over months\", 'They urged the agency to dig deeper hoping it would demand more refunds or other stiff remedies', \"But the agency's track record one of complacency in the eyes of state officials leaves California regulators skeptical that Washington will confront the big power producers\", \"The small obscure agency tucked behind the rail yard of Union Station here has largely soft pedaled its role as the electricity industry's top cop even though it has wide authority to keep power companies in line\", 'To keep rates reasonable it can impose price caps strip companies of the right to charge market rates force them to return excessive profits and even suspend deregulation altogether', 'Instead the agency has largely left it to private companies to pry open the billion electricity industry which has historically been controlled by monopoly utilities and state officials', \"The agency's defenders including its chairman Curt Hebert Jr a fierce advocate of unfettered markets say that its largely hands off approach reflects the delicate balancing of competing interests a commitment to protect consumers while not stifling market forces\", \"But politicians utility executives energy economists and local regulators say California's rolling blackouts and skyrocketing electricity prices are the signs of a market running amok\", 'They accuse the agency of standing aside as companies manipulate their way to windfall profits', \"The agency's critics who include one of its own commissioners and numerous staff members say that its enforcement mission has been blunted by free market passions and the influence of industry insiders in its ranks\", 'When the agency began its first national investigation of high electricity prices last year it named a newly recruited industry insider Scott Miller to lead the effort', \"Mr Miller and his colleagues said in their report that there was ''insufficient data'' in California to prove any profiteering by generating companies\", 'Yet his own former employer PG&E Energy Trading was at the time a subject of a civil antitrust investigation by the Justice Department that focused on electricity market abuses in New England', 'The agency has given state regulators a lead role in monitoring local power markets', 'Yet even as these regulators have urged the agency to be more aggressive in investigating suspicions that companies have abused their power in California New England the Midwest and the mid Atlantic they have frequently been ignored or rebuffed', 'Critics say that the agency began deregulation before it was ready or willing to make sure the markets worked effectively', 'They accuse it of showing favoritism to industry allowing companies for example to ignore requirements to file detailed reports of market transactions that are critical to proving accusations of market abuses', \"''We need to wake up to the fact that this is a dysfunctional market that is being gamed and manipulated by those who participate in it '' said William Massey a commissioner of the agency who has become one of its leading critics\", \"The agency's inaction the critics say leads to ''gaming'' jockeying for profits that does not necessarily involve illegality and outright market manipulation\", 'Consumers and utilities are the victims paying billions of dollars more for electricity than if the markets were truly competitive', 'Agency officials acknowledge that enforcement of market rules to curb gaming and manipulation had not been a high priority in previous years', 'But they defended their recent California order as proof that they intend to keep markets free of abuse', 'They add that the agency is also pressuring two generators to refund almost million for possibly manipulating the California market last spring', 'Agency officials and some outside analysts say that poorly conceived deregulation plans by states a shortage of power plants rising natural gas prices and even the weather have had more impact on electricity prices than abuses by companies or any failings by the agency', 'They say the agency must balance the competing interests of generators local regulators and utility companies if it is to keep deregulation on track', \"''We're trying to craft a system that gives breathing room to develop a market but not so much room that undue market power punishes consumers '' Mr Hebert said\", \"Fight Over Deregulation Today's debate traces back to the 's when President Franklin D Roosevelt backed legislation to break up utility monopolies\", \"The Federal Power Act of gave the Federal Power Commission a mandate to ensure ''just and reasonable'' electricity rates\", 'The Federal Power Commission was abolished in and replaced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission an independent agency with employees that also oversees oil pipelines and the natural gas market', 'The president appoints the chairman and four commissioners two Democrats and two Republicans with staggered terms of five years', 'Two Republican seats are currently unfilled', \"The deregulation of the electricity markets began in the late 's after the agency had begun opening the gas markets\", 'By the commissioners issued a landmark order that forced utility companies to open their transmission lines to other utilities and electricity wholesalers', 'The commission and many private economists expected that by prying open protected markets electricity prices would immediately fall', 'That possibility set off a deregulation frenzy most prominently in California New York New England and the mid Atlantic states', 'Generating companies rushed to expand in the new borderless market', \"But the agency's balancing act has grown more difficult as electricity deregulation has spread nationwide\", 'Congress has forced it to trim its staff in recent years', 'Officials complain that investigating abuses in electricity markets strains their resources', 'And as the California crisis has worsened the commissioners have begun sparring publicly among themselves about what to do', 'This week Mr Massey a Democratic commissioner and Mr Hebert pronounced AY bear a Republican sat side by side before a House panel and argued diametrically opposed positions', \"Mr Hebert said high prices in California ''were sending the right signals to get supply there ''\", \"Mr Massey called the prices that generators were charging ''unlawful'' and said that his agency by not reining them in ''is simply not doing its job ''\", \"The agency's leadership has been in flux for months\", 'Congressional and industry officials in Washington say President Bush is considering replacing Mr Hebert whom he named to the top post less than two months ago with Pat Wood who runs the Texas public utility commission', 'A White House spokeswoman had no comment on the reports', \"Though Mr Hebert's positions are not far from those of the Bush administration his relations with California leaders may have made his position tenuous\", 'Mr Hebert a Mississippian who is a close ally of the Senate majority leader Trent Lott has warred with California politicians who have proposed new solutions to the crisis there', 'Mr Hebert who has served as a commissioner since has often taken the most ideologically free market position of any commissioner', 'He flatly rejects the idea of price caps on electricity as hopelessly ineffective and contrary to market forces', 'When Gov', \"Gray Davis outlined a plan to have the state buy transmission lines to relieve utility companies' debt Mr Hebert's response was dismissive\", \"''It's not in the interest of the American public '' he pronounced\", 'Even as new electricity markets opened in the summer of they started producing nasty shocks', 'The mid Atlantic region experienced some early volatility', \"As the turmoil grew economists began raising the alarm about a phenomenon called ''market power '' the ability of energy traders in the new national market to sustain prices above the competitive level\", 'Proving such abuses is difficult because it requires comparing tens of thousands of separate electricity transactions with the costs of the generators that initiated them', 'Joseph Bowring who heads the market monitoring unit of the nonprofit entity that operates the mid Atlantic transmission system said that power companies there had exercised some market power', 'But only the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission not local regulators had the authority to collect the data to determine how much market power had been exercised and whether it had been abusive or not he said', 'Mr Bowring said he talked to agency officials about doing so', 'In the end Mr Bowring and several agency officials said the agency chose not to investigate', 'The decision roiled some agency officials', \"Ron Rattey a veteran agency economist wrote a memorandum last June describing the staff as ''impotent in our ability to monitor foster and ensure competitive electric power markets ''\", 'The staff the memorandum said did not even enforce a requirement that power companies file detailed quarterly reports listing essentially every sale they make', 'Such data would have been useful to Mr Bowring', 'Local Federal Clash Local regulators who want to ensure competitive prices often have to act on their own', 'Monitors in New England have intervened about times since to correct prices they determined had been caused at least in part by market manipulation', 'The federal agency has sometimes chastised them for interfering too much', 'The industry not surprisingly shares that view', 'One vocal critic was Mr Miller', 'Before the agency recruited him last July to head its division of energy markets he was director of policy coordination for the national energy trading unit of PG&E Corporation the California holding company whose assets also include Pacific Gas and Electric the California utility', \"Although the utility has lost billions of dollars during California's crisis Mr Miller's former unit has become one of the most profitable new energy traders nationwide\", 'PG&E Energy Trading by several estimates is now the second largest seller of electricity in New England', 'The company has had a rocky relationship with regulators', 'They intervened several times in and to retroactively cancel auctions they said produced excessive profits for PG&E and other companies', \"Mr Miller denounced the practice though he acknowledged in public testimony that his company sometimes charged ''very high'' prices when it could\", \"''One person's predatory pricing is another person's competitive advantage '' Mr Miller said at a public hearing on deregulation in Texas in\", \"New England regulators too often acted as ''judge jury and executioner'' when overseeing the market he said\", \"One year later Mr Miller and his new colleagues at the federal agency got a chance to examine New England's problems from the regulators' perspective\", \"Their Nov report attributed New England's frequent price gyrations to technical and regulatory flaws\", \"As Mr Miller's team was preparing its report the Justice Department whose threshold for stepping into possible industry wrongdoing is far higher than the agency's began looking into whether price spikes in New England pointed to unlawful monopoly power or collusion people contacted by the department during that inquiry said\", \"One subject of the civil inquiry is possible price manipulation in one of New England's ancillary services markets people contacted by the department said\", 'They said the department was examining whether PG&E and two other companies tried to corner that market for several months early last year', \"PG&E confirmed that the Justice Department had contacted it but denies wrongdoing and says it has cooperated with the department's requests\", 'Mr Miller has declined to comment on his role at PG&E or at the agency', 'His supervisors defended his work and said they had detected no conflict of interest between his work at PG&E and his duties at the agency', 'Those duties brought Mr Miller to California last August', \"With electricity prices there soaring he and his colleagues sat down with several utility executives at the agency's San Francisco office\", 'One executive Gary Stern director of market monitoring for Southern California Edison wanted the agency to stop what he suspected were market abuses by power generators', 'He provided a road map to help investigators figure out how power companies traded power contracts and whether they had manipulated the markets', 'But when Mr Miller and his team approached generators and marketers including his old employer a few weeks later they did it their way', \"They asked eight questions many of them imprecise like ''Describe your strategy for bidding generation resources into market ''\", \"This question Mr Stern said in a recent interview ''was equivalent to asking a suspected burglar how he spent his day ''\", 'Some agency officials also thought the team should probe deeper', 'Mr Rattey recommended that Mr Miller seek the quarterly pricing reports that marketers were supposed to file', 'But his suggestion was not adopted agency records show', \"Daniel Larcamp Mr Miller's supervisor said ''there might have been more information that could have been obtained'' in the California inquiry\", 'But he said the commission gave the staff only three months to finish making it impossible to collect and analyze the reams of data involved', 'For Mr Miller agency documents show the investigation was so time consuming that he had no time to fill out the financial disclosure form required of new federal employees', 'Mr Miller submitted his form in late January after a reporter requested it', 'Agency lawyers approved the form but only after he provided additional information about his job and compensation from PG&E', \"The lawyers said Mr Miller's participation had been permissible because PG&E was not the subject of the investigation\", 'When the staff report was issued on Nov it found high prices and problems in the design of the California market', \"But while the companies ''had the potential to exercise market power '' the commission said there was ''insufficient data'' to prove that they did\", 'Some marketers saw the report as an exoneration', \"''This has been looked at several times most notably by the FERC and nobody has found any evidence of market manipulation and profiteering '' Rob Doty the chief financial officer of Dynegy Inc told a reporter earlier this year\", 'California Inquiry The agency has recently shown signs of wanting to apply pressure on generators', 'But its early efforts show how it is treading on new and uncertain turf', 'When the California crisis grew severe last December the commission issued a refund order a shot across the bow for generators charging high prices', 'It required them to submit detailed data any time they sold electricity in California for more than per megawatt hour considered at the time a fair estimate of the highest costs any of them faced', 'It also told generators that for the next several months they could be forced to give refunds if the agency found that they had charged excessive prices', 'The commission also said that it would examine bidding practices and strategies for withholding generating capacity to ferret out any efforts to artificially raise prices', \"When the agency's own day deadline for examining market data in January approached however it became clear that staff members had not made any detailed examination\", 'Instead staff members said the agency scrambled to forge a last minute compromise that would allow it to issue a statement opposing high prices in the state without a time consuming investigation',

pursuant to a tolling agreement filed with the Commission', 'The Cal ISO designated the two units as RMR units that it could call on when necessary to provide energy and ancillary service essential to the reliability of the California transmission network', \"The Cal ISO makes both a fixed payment to the RMR owner or operator to compensate for the RMR unit's availability and a variable payment for the RMR unit's output if the unit is not otherwise participating in the market\", 'Williams Energy and the Cal ISO executed RMR agreements filed as rate schedules with the Commission allowing the Cal ISO to dispatch units solely for purposes of meeting local reliability needs or managing intra zonal congestion', 'The ISO may dispatch a non RMR unit if the designated RMR unit is not available',

units less the market revenues from the respective units' output\", 'Accordingly FERC observed Williams Energy had a financial incentive to prolong any outages of Alamitos and Huntington Beach in April and May', \"The bid price for the non RMR units was at or near the Cal ISO's then effective bid cap of MWh FERC continued\", 'Therefore Williams Energy received payments from the Cal ISO of more than million or about million greater than the estimated average variable operating cost of the non RMR units approximately MWh during the period in question', 'This indicates a refund amount including interest of nearly million', 'The information in this order and a non public appendix the Commission declared suggests that AES declared outages at the two RMR units and maintained Huntington Beach in a manner inconsistent with good utility practice and that Williams Energy took action to extend the outage at Alamitos and to make Huntington Beach unavailable for pretextual reasons', \"Based on this information coupled with Williams Energy's financial incentive not to make the Alamitos and Huntington Beach units available FERC found serious questions about whether AES and Williams Energy violated applicable RMR contracts and tariffs on file with the Commission pursuant to FPA section when they refused to make Alamitos and Huntington Beach available for dispatch by the Cal ISO whether Williams acted inconsistently with its market based rate authority and the market monitoring information protocols of the Cal ISO's tariff regarding the unavailability of the RMR

Inc NY ISO is warning of serious electricity shortages air quality deterioration and stunted economic growth without immediate approval of between MW of new generating capacity in the state', 'Of this amount MW is needed to serve New York City', \"Another MW of new capacity will have to be built by the NY ISO said in a recent report Power Alert New York's Energy Crossroads\", 'New York is heading towards a very serious situation unless it acts immediately to get new supply sited within its borders said NY ISO president William Museler in a statement accompanying the report', \"This report is essentially a caution light at New York's energy crossroads\", \"Sources in the New York Public Service Commission have downplayed the NY ISO's warning asserting that a process for bringing on new generation is well underway with more than projects in the approval pipeline\", \"In a related development the NY ISO asked FERC to approve a proposed tariff amendment ER extending existing bids caps in some of its markets until and a separate and related amendment ER extending the NY ISO's so called temporary extraordinary procedures TEP that allow the ISO to make price adjustments and take other corrective actions if it finds evidence of market power abuse\", 'The NY ISO Report The NY ISO likened the situation in New York to that faced by California where a relentless increase in demand has not been met with an equal increase in supply', 'The NY ISO said that between and statewide demand for electricity rose by MW while generating capacity increased by only MW', 'With no major new generating plants in downstate New York fully approved for construction at this time and generation demand in the state expected to grow around percent annually for the next several years the NY ISO said this gap will continue to widen', \"The inevitable result of this trend is large rate increases for New York's power consumers\", \"The NY ISO's modeling suggests that by statewide prices are likely to be more than percent lower in the case in which new plants are built than in the case where they are not\", 'In New York City the price to consumers of electric power could be reduced by as much as percent when compared to the case of no new supply or load management programs', 'Besides large rate increases the NY ISO asserted that a failure to site and build new plants in New York will threaten power reliability in the state and lead to increasing reliance on out of state resources', \"The report said that if no new in state generation comes on line in the next five years the state's generation reserve margins will shrink from the current percent above peak demand to a dangerously low percent by\", \"Pointing to California's situation the report added that increased reliance on power imports can subject electrical suppliers and customers in New York to transmission restrictions and political and economic considerations beyond the control or influence of responsible New York State entities\", \"To avoid these harsh consequences the NY ISO said New York's new siting law known as the Article X process needs to be modified\", 'Since the law was passed months ago the report noted that only two plants have been approved both upstate and neither has yet been built', 'The problem according to the NY ISO is that the siting process requires the cooperation of multiple state agencies', \"To expedite the process the report suggested the clear designation of a lead agency and the adoption of an ombudsman program' to expedite and coordinate the work of the agencies responsible for the Article X process must be made\", 'The NY ISO added that an expedited approval process would improve the environment because older more polluting power plants would be replaced by cleaner gas fired units', \"On a more positive note the NY ISO reported that New York's restructured power market is far healthier than that in California due in large part to the ability of New York s utilities to enter long term power contracts\", 'The basic structure of the New York market will also reduce unwarranted price spikes and other market disruptions through mitigation programs which automatically correct price spikes due to market power abuses', 'Nevertheless California s experience raises a caution flag for all New Yorkers the report continued', 'The deregulated market in New York cannot achieve lower costs through competition without an increase in generating capacity similar in magnitude to the recommendations of this report along with simultaneous efforts to institute greater conservation better load management and alternative energy supply initiatives', 'Additionally closer integration with regional suppliers of power is both inevitable and beneficial', \"The report also recommended accelerating conservation real time metering and price sensitive load programs and upgrading the state's and the Northeast's transmission infrastructure\", \"The Proposed Tariff Amendments New York's Article X siting process and continuing tight supplies were also cited in the NY ISO's request to extend from until its MWh bid caps\", 'FERC first approved the MWh bid caps in July see REPORT No pg and subsequently extended them', \"The NY ISO's board is sensitive to the Commission's concerns about undue intervention in energy markets the filing related\", \"Nevertheless the NY ISO is submitting this request because it believes that delays in New York state's Article X' process for licensing and siting new generating capacity is inhibiting supply from increasing to match continued demand growth\", 'Moreover although the NY ISO proposes to implement several demand side measures this summer it is not yet clear whether they will make demand sufficiently price responsive to avoid periods of high prices that would not occur if there were an efficient demand side response', \"Thus the NY ISO insisted that the requested extension is needed to provide more time for the development of additional generation and to gauge the effectiveness of the NY ISO's proposed demand side response mechanisms in order to avoid exposing consumers to price spikes that are not a product of the interplay of competitive market forces\", \"Other problems cited in the NY ISO's filing which keep New York's power market from being fully competitive include continuing capacity and operating constraints at the state's Central East interface and questions over adequate gas supply\", 'The NY ISO remains acutely aware that taking steps to deal with price abnormalities can have undesirable consequences the filing continued', \"Nevertheless the NY ISO believes that the MWh cap that has been used in the PJM's markets since inception does not appear to have had an adverse impact there\", \"The permanent bid caps in PJM and the interim bid caps in ISO New England proposed for extension through the end of also make continuation of the NY ISO's bid caps more important in order to maintain uniformity across the Northeastern markets\", 'The NY ISO also continues to believe that suppliers will not be materially harmed by the continuation of bid caps which are likely to come into effect very rarely and are set at levels that prevent only artificially high run ups in prices', \"The NY ISO's request to extend

Energy Agency Is Weak in Oversight of Utilities By JEFF GERTH and JOSEPH KAHN The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company WASHINGTON March The pressure was intense when federal regulators met privately last month to debate remedies for soaring electricity prices in California', \"Officials of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the agency whose mandate is to ensure ''just and reasonable'' electricity rates nationwide had evidence that a few companies had been selling electricity to California at prices far above the cost of generating it\", 'The agency faced an imminent deadline to challenge those prices or let the companies possibly pocket hundreds of millions of dollars in unfair profits', 'An internal memorandum laid out two choices', \"The agency could audit and punish ''bad actors '' the companies that were exploiting the market\", \"Or it could identify ''bad hours '' when electricity shortages were most acute and spiking prices were arguably nobody's fault and order refunds for only the most exorbitant prices\", \"''It may be easier to identify bad hours than bad actors '' the memorandum said\", 'The commission took the easier way', \"It decided not to investigate reports of abuses by companies but issued an order that could require them to refund to the state utilities up to million collected during a relatively few ''bad hours'' in January and February\", \"That is hundreds of millions of dollars less than California might have claimed since the most potential overcharging occurred during ''good hours '' when power was more plentiful but prices were often just as extreme\", 'The order ignored those hours', \"Today in a criticism of the agency's lack of aggressiveness California regulators estimated that generators had charged billion above competitive levels over months\", 'They urged the agency to dig deeper hoping it would demand more refunds or other stiff remedies', \"But the agency's track record one of complacency in the eyes of state officials leaves California regulators skeptical that Washington will confront the big power producers\", \"The small obscure agency tucked behind the rail yard of Union Station here has largely soft pedaled its role as the electricity industry's top cop even though it has wide authority to keep power companies in line\", 'To keep rates reasonable it can impose price caps strip companies of the right to charge market rates force them to return excessive profits and even suspend deregulation altogether', 'Instead the agency has largely left it to private companies to pry open the billion electricity industry which has historically been controlled by monopoly utilities and state officials', \"The agency's defenders including its chairman Curt Hebert Jr a fierce advocate of unfettered markets say that its largely hands off approach reflects the delicate balancing of competing interests a commitment to protect consumers while not stifling market forces\", \"But politicians utility executives energy economists and local regulators say California's rolling blackouts and skyrocketing electricity prices are the signs of a market running amok\", 'They accuse the agency of standing aside as companies manipulate their way to windfall profits', \"The agency's critics who include one of its own commissioners and numerous staff members say that its enforcement mission has been blunted by free market passions and the influence of industry insiders in its ranks\", 'When the agency began its first national investigation of high electricity prices last year it named a newly recruited industry insider Scott Miller to lead the effort', \"Mr Miller and his colleagues said in their report that there was ''insufficient data'' in California to prove any profiteering by generating companies\", 'Yet his own former employer PG&E Energy Trading was at the time a subject of a civil antitrust investigation by the Justice Department that focused on

public appendix the Commission declared suggests that AES declared outages at the two RMR units and maintained Huntington Beach in a manner inconsistent with good utility practice and that Williams Energy took action to extend the outage at Alamitos and to make Huntington Beach unavailable for pretextual reasons', \"Based on this information coupled with Williams Energy's financial incentive not to make the Alamitos and Huntington Beach units available FERC found serious questions about whether AES and Williams Energy violated applicable RMR contracts and tariffs on file with the Commission pursuant to FPA section when they refused to make Alamitos and Huntington Beach available for dispatch by the Cal ISO whether Williams acted inconsistently with its market based rate authority and the

computer while cutting deals and arranging gas shipments\", 'Although the Gas Co buys the commodity for its customers the company also sells to marketers other utilities and producers', \"State officials say the number of transactions by the company has risen steeply to to a year including gas sales along California's border where prices have rocketed\", \"The PUC created the cost incentive program for the state's three major gas utilities San Diego Gas & Electric Co in Southern California Gas the next year and PG&E Corp 's Pacific Gas & Electric Co in\", 'Like Southern California Gas SDG&E is a subsidiary of Sempra Energy', 'The program was designed to give utilities added motivation for obtaining gas at the best price for customers', 'It replaced lengthy and contentious reviews by the PUC which assessed whether utilities had purchased gas at reasonable prices and sometimes ordered them to return millions of dollars to customers', 'An annual audit of the Gas Co program and a staff evaluation requested by the PUC recently concluded that the program has achieved many of its goals but it also proposed adjustments that would give customers a greater share of the rewards', 'These incentives were designed in less volatile times said program supervisor Mark Pocta of the Office of Ratepayer Advocates which conducted the audit', 'There is a question of how much should go to ratepayers and shareholders', \"His office also plans to assess whether the Gas Co 's trading had any negative effects on the gas market resulting in diminished supplies or higher prices for other utilities and their customers\", 'Under the program the Gas Co shares risks and rewards with its ratepayers but since the program was launched it has consistently produced awards', 'If the cost of gas is or more below a benchmark based on monthly gas market indexes the company and its customers split the savings', \"California's gas utilities are not allowed to profit on their raw commodity costs they merely pass along those costs to ratepayers with no markup\", \"The savings under the incentive program are automatically reflected in consumers' monthly gas bills but are not itemized\", 'At the end of the year the utilities request their share of the savings and the PUC has routinely granted approval', 'Then the companies and thus their shareholders are paid through customer utility bills', 'The resulting bill increases typically have been modest less than', 'But as the awards increase regulators say the effect on customers will become more significant unless the present structure is changed', \"There's no question when you start to talk about million or more in savings and add the company's award into rates in a year it will make a noticeable difference said Los Angeles economist Jeff Leitzinger president of Econ One who has done consulting for the Gas Co\", 'Still he said ratepayers should bear in mind that they already benefit from below market gas and transportation costs', \"In the early years of the program records show the Gas Co 's awards went from zero to million million million and million\", \"Last year's award of million is awaiting PUC approval\", \"This year's proposed award covering the period through the end of this month has not yet been submitted by the Gas Co\", 'But the utility has provided monthly figures and oral updates on a confidential basis to PUC officials who declined to provide figures', 'Harrigan of the Gas Co said the savings are expected to multiply many times over largely because the company was well equipped for the market fluctuations and tried to insulate its customers from high gas prices', 'Any trading company especially one with assets like we have has benefited from volatility in the market he said', \"Harrigan said however that he does not believe the company's level of activity has adversely affected the market and that its trading pales in volume to that of unregulated energy companies\", \"Anne Smith the Gas Co 's vice president of customer service and marketing said the utility will not release figures for this year's incentive program until they are filed with the PUC in June\", \"I don't want to interrupt that process Smith said noting that the PUC ultimately will determine the company's award\", 'I think they need to focus on what the Gas Co has done for the ratepayers', 'It has been immense', 'Although the typical monthly gas bill has risen to from a year ago Gas Co customers tend to have lower rates than those of other California utilities', \"The company's gas procurement cost in February was cents per therm or cubic feet\", \"That's more than twice last year's cost but only about half what sister company SDG&E paid for its customers in February\", \"It's also much lower than the per therm PG&E pays\", 'We were as upset about the overall gas price increase as anyone else Harrigan said', 'I would rather see the prices of a year ago even though we managed to do a little better in the recent environment', 'When it comes to keeping down costs regulators say the Gas Co has advantages over other utilities in the marketplace', 'For one the company has so much pipeline capacity at major gas basins that it purchases a relatively small portion of its needs about to at the California border where prices in December briefly rose to the equivalent of per therm or times those a year earlier', 'This presents opportunities', 'At the beginning of the month they forecast a certain amount of gas they have to buy said Pocta of the Office of Ratepayer Advocates', 'If they go out and buy and do not need to use as much because the weather is more moderate than expected they can either inject the gas into storage or they can make sales at the border', 'Customers he pointed out may be entitled to additional benefits because they pay for the interstate and intrastate pipeline capacity and the gas storage that give the company the flexibility to make advantageous deals', 'By the same token we want the Gas Co', 'to go into the market and generate cost savings that can be passed on to the customers he added', 'We want them to have incentives', 'The question is how to balance them', 'Under deregulation the Gas Co adopted the nontraditional role of marketer according to a PUC Energy Division report in January', 'The company makes gas sales at various locations', 'It engages in exchanges', 'It makes futures transactions to help stabilize costs', 'They look for ways to lower the gas cost said Richard Myers program supervisor at the Energy Division', 'Before they were lots more risk averse', 'Now they feel they can take risks and make money for shareholders and it is a benefit for ratepayers at the same time', 'The incentive programs are tailored to individual utilities so it is difficult to compare them', 'Records show that the shared savings at SDG&E a much smaller utility declined steadily from million in the cycle to in', 'Spokesman Ed Van Herik said the falloff largely represents a drop in gas purchases especially as the company sold off its own gas fired electricity generating plants', 'He said the company does not yet know how much savings have accrued in the last year', 'In an annual report to the PUC in February PG&E said it had no savings under the incentive program and thus it is not entitled to any award for the cycle', \"The Utility Reform Network a San Francisco based consumer advocacy group said it will closely watch the PUC's evaluation of the incentive program at the Gas Co We want to make sure given the dramatic changes in the gas market and prices ratepayers are not left out of the additional benefits TURN attorney Marcel Hawiger said\", \"We'll look to see whether the mechanism should be changed\",

articles in this section use the file at the end of the section Critics Say U S Energy Agency Is Weak in Oversight of Utilities By JEFF GERTH and JOSEPH KAHN The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company WASHINGTON March The pressure was intense when federal regulators met privately last month to debate remedies for soaring electricity prices in California', \"Officials of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the agency whose mandate is to ensure ''just and reasonable'' electricity rates nationwide had evidence that a few companies had been selling electricity to California at prices far above the cost of generating it\", 'The agency faced an imminent deadline to challenge those prices or let the companies possibly pocket hundreds of millions of dollars in unfair profits', 'An internal memorandum laid out two choices', \"The agency could audit and punish ''bad actors '' the companies that were exploiting the market\", \"Or it could identify ''bad hours '' when electricity shortages were most acute and spiking prices were arguably nobody's fault and order refunds for only the most exorbitant prices\", \"''It may be easier to identify bad hours than bad actors '' the memorandum said\", 'The commission took the easier way', \"It decided not to investigate reports of abuses by companies but issued an order that could require them to refund to the state utilities up to million collected during a relatively few ''bad hours'' in January and February\", \"That is hundreds of millions of dollars less than California might have claimed since the most potential overcharging occurred during ''good hours '' when power was more plentiful but prices were often just as extreme\", 'The order ignored those hours', \"Today in a criticism of the agency's lack of aggressiveness California regulators estimated that generators had charged billion above competitive levels over months\", 'They urged the agency to dig deeper hoping it would demand more refunds or other stiff remedies', \"But the agency's track record one of complacency in the eyes of state officials leaves California regulators skeptical that Washington will confront the big power producers\", \"The small obscure agency tucked behind the rail yard of Union Station here has largely soft pedaled its role as the electricity industry's top cop even though it has wide authority to keep power companies in line\", 'To keep rates reasonable it can impose price caps strip companies of the right to charge market rates force them to return excessive profits and even suspend deregulation altogether', 'Instead the agency has largely left it to private companies to pry open the billion electricity industry which has historically been controlled by monopoly utilities and state officials', \"The agency's defenders including its chairman Curt Hebert Jr a fierce advocate of unfettered markets say that its largely hands off approach reflects the delicate balancing of competing interests a commitment to protect consumers while not stifling market forces\", \"But politicians utility executives energy economists and local regulators say California's rolling blackouts and skyrocketing electricity prices are the signs of a market running amok\", 'They accuse the agency of standing aside as companies manipulate their way to windfall profits', \"The agency's critics who include one of its own commissioners and numerous staff members say that its enforcement mission has been blunted by free market passions and the influence of industry insiders in its ranks\", 'When the agency began its first national investigation of high electricity prices last year it named a newly recruited industry insider Scott Miller to lead the effort', \"Mr Miller and his colleagues said in their report that there was ''insufficient data'' in California to prove any profiteering by generating companies\", 'Yet his own former employer PG&E Energy Trading was at the time a subject of a civil antitrust investigation by the Justice Department that focused on electricity market abuses in New England', 'The agency has given state regulators a lead role in monitoring local power markets', 'Yet even as these regulators have urged the agency to be more aggressive in investigating suspicions that companies have abused their power in California New England the Midwest and the mid Atlantic they have frequently been ignored or rebuffed', 'Critics say that the agency began deregulation before it was ready or willing to make sure the markets worked effectively', 'They accuse it of showing favoritism to industry allowing companies for example to ignore requirements to file detailed reports of market transactions that are critical to proving accusations of market abuses', \"''We need to wake up to the fact that this is a dysfunctional market that is being gamed and manipulated by those who participate in it '' said William Massey a commissioner of the agency who has become one of its leading critics\", \"The agency's inaction the critics say leads to ''gaming'' jockeying for profits that does not necessarily involve illegality and outright market manipulation\", 'Consumers and utilities are the victims paying billions of dollars more for electricity than if the markets were truly competitive', 'Agency officials acknowledge that enforcement of market rules to curb gaming and manipulation had not been a high priority in previous years', 'But they defended their recent California order as proof that they intend to keep markets free of abuse', 'They add that the agency is also pressuring two generators to refund almost million for possibly manipulating the California market last spring', 'Agency officials and some outside analysts say that poorly conceived deregulation plans by states a shortage of power plants rising natural gas prices and even the weather have had more impact on electricity prices than abuses by companies or any failings by the agency', 'They say the agency must balance the competing interests of generators local regulators and utility companies if it is to keep deregulation on track', \"''We're trying to craft a system that gives breathing room to develop a market but not so much room that undue market power punishes consumers '' Mr Hebert said\", \"Fight Over Deregulation Today's debate traces back to the 's when President Franklin D Roosevelt backed legislation to break up utility monopolies\", \"The Federal Power Act of gave the Federal Power Commission a mandate to ensure ''just and reasonable'' electricity rates\", 'The Federal Power Commission was abolished in and replaced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission an independent agency with employees that also oversees oil pipelines and the natural gas market', 'The president appoints the chairman and four commissioners two Democrats and two Republicans with staggered terms of five years', 'Two Republican seats are currently unfilled', \"The deregulation of the electricity markets began in the late 's after the agency had begun opening the gas markets\", 'By the commissioners issued a landmark order that forced utility companies to open their transmission lines to other utilities and electricity wholesalers', 'The commission and many private economists expected that by prying open protected markets electricity prices would immediately fall', 'That possibility set off a deregulation frenzy most prominently in California New York New England and the mid Atlantic states', 'Generating companies rushed to expand in the new borderless market', \"But the agency's balancing act has grown more difficult as electricity deregulation has spread nationwide\", 'Congress has forced it to trim its staff in recent years', 'Officials complain that investigating abuses in electricity markets strains their resources', 'And as the California crisis has worsened the commissioners have begun sparring publicly among themselves about what to do', 'This week Mr Massey a Democratic commissioner and Mr Hebert pronounced AY bear a Republican sat side by side before a House panel and argued diametrically opposed positions', \"Mr Hebert said high prices in California ''were sending the right signals to get supply there ''\", \"Mr Massey called the prices that generators were charging ''unlawful'' and said that his agency by not reining them in ''is simply not doing its job ''\", \"The agency's leadership has been in flux for months\", 'Congressional and industry officials in Washington say President Bush is considering replacing Mr Hebert whom he named to the top post less than two months ago with Pat Wood who runs the Texas public utility commission', 'A White House spokeswoman had no comment on the reports', \"Though Mr Hebert's positions are not far from those of the Bush administration his relations with California leaders may have made his position tenuous\", 'Mr Hebert a Mississippian who is a close ally of the Senate majority leader Trent Lott has warred with California politicians who have proposed new solutions to the crisis there', 'Mr Hebert who has served as a commissioner since has often taken the most ideologically free market position of any commissioner', 'He flatly rejects the idea of price caps on electricity as hopelessly ineffective and contrary to market forces', 'When Gov', \"Gray Davis outlined a plan to have the state buy transmission lines to relieve utility companies' debt Mr Hebert's response was dismissive\", \"''It's not in the interest of the American public '' he pronounced\", 'Even as new electricity markets opened in the summer of they started producing nasty shocks', 'The mid Atlantic region experienced some early volatility', \"As the turmoil grew economists began raising the alarm about a phenomenon called ''market power '' the ability of energy traders in the new national market to sustain prices above the competitive level\", 'Proving such abuses is difficult because it requires comparing tens of thousands of separate electricity transactions with the costs of the generators that initiated them', 'Joseph Bowring who heads the market monitoring unit of the nonprofit entity that operates the mid Atlantic transmission system said that power companies there had exercised some market power', 'But only the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission not local regulators had the authority to collect the data to determine how much market power had been exercised and whether it had been abusive or not he said', 'Mr Bowring said he talked to agency officials about doing so', 'In the end Mr Bowring and several agency officials said the agency chose not to investigate', 'The decision roiled some agency officials', \"Ron Rattey a veteran agency economist wrote a memorandum last June describing the staff as ''impotent in our ability to monitor foster and ensure competitive electric power markets ''\", 'The staff the memorandum said did not even enforce a requirement that power companies file detailed quarterly reports listing essentially every sale they make', 'Such data would have been useful to Mr Bowring', 'Local Federal Clash Local regulators who want to ensure competitive prices often have to act on their own', 'Monitors in New England have intervened about times since to correct prices they determined had been caused at least in part by market manipulation', 'The federal agency has sometimes chastised them for interfering too much', 'The industry not surprisingly shares that view', 'One vocal critic was Mr Miller', 'Before the agency recruited him last July to head its division of energy markets he was director of policy coordination for the national energy trading unit of PG&E Corporation the California holding company whose assets also include Pacific Gas and Electric the California utility', \"Although the utility has lost billions of dollars during California's crisis Mr Miller's former unit has become one of the most profitable new energy traders nationwide\", 'PG&E Energy Trading by several estimates is now the second largest seller of electricity in New England', 'The company has had a rocky relationship with regulators', 'They intervened several times in and to retroactively cancel auctions they said produced excessive profits for PG&E and other companies', \"Mr Miller denounced the practice though he acknowledged in public testimony that his company sometimes charged ''very high'' prices when it could\", \"''One person's predatory pricing is another person's competitive advantage '' Mr Miller said at a public hearing on deregulation in Texas in\", \"New England regulators too often acted as ''judge jury and executioner'' when overseeing the market he said\", \"One year later Mr Miller and his new colleagues at the federal agency got a chance to examine New England's problems from the regulators' perspective\", \"Their Nov report attributed New England's frequent price gyrations to technical and regulatory flaws\", \"As Mr Miller's team was preparing its report the Justice Department whose threshold for stepping into possible industry wrongdoing is far higher than the agency's began looking into whether price spikes in New England pointed to unlawful monopoly power or collusion people contacted by the department during that inquiry said\", \"One subject of the civil inquiry is possible price manipulation in one of New England's ancillary services markets people contacted by the department said\", 'They said the department was examining whether PG&E and two other companies tried to corner that market for several months early last year', \"PG&E confirmed that the Justice Department had contacted it but denies wrongdoing and says it has cooperated with the department's requests\", 'Mr Miller has declined to comment on his role at PG&E or at the agency', 'His supervisors defended his work and said they had detected no conflict of interest between his work at PG&E and his duties at the agency', 'Those duties brought Mr Miller to California last August', \"With electricity prices there soaring he and his colleagues sat down with several utility executives at the agency's San Francisco office\", 'One executive Gary Stern director of market monitoring for Southern California Edison wanted the agency to stop what he suspected were market abuses by power generators', 'He provided a road map to help investigators figure out how power companies traded power contracts and whether they had manipulated the markets', 'But when Mr Miller and his team approached generators and marketers including his old employer a few weeks later they did it their way', \"They asked eight questions many of them imprecise like ''Describe your strategy for bidding generation resources into market ''\", \"This question Mr Stern said in a recent interview ''was equivalent to asking a suspected burglar how he spent his day ''\", 'Some agency officials also thought the team should probe deeper', 'Mr Rattey recommended that Mr Miller seek the quarterly pricing reports that marketers were supposed to file', 'But his suggestion was not adopted agency records show', \"Daniel Larcamp Mr Miller's supervisor said ''there might have been more information that could have been obtained'' in the California inquiry\", 'But he said the commission gave the staff only three months to finish making it impossible to collect and analyze the reams of data involved', 'For Mr Miller agency documents show the investigation was so time consuming that he had no time to fill out the financial disclosure form required of new federal employees', 'Mr Miller submitted his form in late January after a reporter requested it', 'Agency lawyers approved the form but only after he provided additional information about his job and compensation from PG&E', \"The lawyers said Mr Miller's participation had been permissible because PG&E was not the subject of the investigation\", 'When the staff report was issued on Nov it found high prices and problems in the design of the California market', \"But while the companies ''had the potential to exercise market power '' the commission said there was ''insufficient data'' to prove that they did\", 'Some marketers saw the report as an exoneration', \"''This has been looked at several times most notably by the FERC and nobody has found any evidence of market manipulation and profiteering '' Rob Doty the chief financial officer of Dynegy Inc told a reporter earlier this year\", 'California Inquiry The agency has recently shown signs of wanting to apply pressure on generators', 'But its early efforts show how it is treading on new and uncertain turf', 'When the California crisis grew severe last December the commission issued a refund order a shot across the bow for generators charging high prices', 'It required them to submit detailed data any time they sold electricity in California for more than per megawatt hour considered at the time a fair estimate of the highest costs any of them faced', 'It also told generators that for the next several months they could be forced to give refunds if the agency found that they had charged excessive prices', 'The commission also said that it would examine bidding practices and strategies for withholding generating capacity to ferret out any efforts to artificially raise prices', \"When the agency's own day deadline for examining market data in January approached however it became clear that staff members had not made any detailed examination\", 'Instead staff members said the agency scrambled to forge a last minute compromise that would allow it to issue a statement opposing high prices in the state without a time consuming investigation', 'During this scramble a senior staff member Kevin Kelly suggested focusing on bad hours instead of bad actors', \"''Our attempts to find illegal behavior or legal 'misbehavior' by sellers 'bad actors' always seems to fail '' his memorandum said\", 'It said that the agency could more easily blame high prices on acute shortages during the most critical hours', 'The suggestion won the day', 'The commission decided to limit its order to the hours when California declared a Stage emergency when supplies are critically low', 'Mr Stern of Southern California Edison and several private sector economists have attacked the economic logic of that order', 'They said that the commission has focused on times when prices might be legitimately high', 'The bigger worry Generators can and often do sustain artificially high prices when supplies are not as tight they say', 'Mr Massey the Democratic commissioner dissented from the decision for those reasons', \"Because most high priced transactions in January and February did not occur during bad hours he argued the commission effectively chose to bless as ''just and reasonable'' the hefty profits generators are making from the California crisis\", \"''The problem with my agency is that we're so carried away with the rhetoric of markets that we've gotten sloppy '' Mr Massey said\", \"''We're talking about electricity\", \"It's the juice of the economy so it's got to be available and reasonably priced ''\", 'Williams defends pricing of electricity Associated Press Newswires

Energy and AES could be required to refund excess profits of million as calculated by FERC and face restrictions on their market based rate authority for a year', 'The show cause order involves two generation units Alamitos and Huntington Beach owned and operated by AES', 'Williams Energy markets all output from the Alamitos and Huntington Beach plants including the two units at issue here pursuant to a tolling agreement filed with the Commission', 'The Cal ISO designated the two units as RMR units that it could call on when necessary to provide energy and ancillary service essential to the reliability of the California transmission network', \"The Cal ISO makes both a fixed payment to the RMR owner or operator to compensate for the RMR unit's availability and a variable payment for the RMR unit's output if the unit is not otherwise participating in the market\", 'Williams Energy and the Cal ISO executed RMR agreements filed as rate schedules with the Commission allowing the Cal ISO to dispatch units solely for purposes of meeting local reliability needs or managing intra zonal congestion', 'The ISO may dispatch a non RMR unit if the designated RMR unit is not available',

price for service provided by the replacement units\", \"By contrast if the RMR units had not experienced outages and been available from April through May Williams Energy would have received either the market revenues only from the respective units which would have resulted in no payments for RMR output from the ISO to Williams Energy or Williams Energy's variable cost for operating the RMR units less the market revenues from the respective units' output\", 'Accordingly FERC observed Williams Energy had a financial incentive to prolong any outages of Alamitos and Huntington Beach in April and May', \"The bid price for the non RMR units was at or near the Cal ISO's then effective bid cap of MWh FERC continued\", 'Therefore Williams Energy received payments from the Cal ISO of more than million or about million greater than the estimated average variable operating cost of the non RMR units approximately MWh during the period in question', 'This indicates a refund amount including interest of nearly million', 'The information in this order and a non public appendix the Commission declared suggests that AES declared outages at the two RMR units and maintained Huntington Beach in a manner inconsistent with good utility practice and that Williams Energy took action to extend the outage at Alamitos and to make Huntington Beach unavailable for pretextual reasons', \"Based on this information coupled with Williams Energy's financial incentive not to make the Alamitos and Huntington Beach units available FERC found serious questions about whether AES and Williams Energy violated applicable RMR contracts and tariffs on file with the Commission pursuant to FPA section when they refused to make Alamitos and Huntington Beach available for dispatch by the Cal ISO whether Williams acted inconsistently with its market based rate authority and the market monitoring information protocols of the Cal ISO's tariff regarding the unavailability of the RMR

Energy and AES to show cause within days why they should not be found to have committed the above described violations and why the specified remedies should not be imposed', 'Further to ensure

Dingell and Oberstar, who were able to persuade enough Democrats to vote against the Senate bill so that it fell short of the 2/3 needed for passage under suspension of the rules.', 'Senate bill sponsors/supporters are extremely angry at House Democrats for killing the Senate legislation, and at the White House/DOT for not strongly promoting the Senate bill (which they previously had supported) and reigning in House Democrats.', 'Senator Patty Murray called the White House and expressed her concern, which prompted a series of meetings between staff for Senate and House Democrats and the White House to discuss a solution.', 'In these meetings, House Democrats have proposed adding several provisions from the Dingell/Oberstar legislation to the Senate bill and moving that package on an omnibus or appropriations bill.', 'Sources close to Rep. Dingell indicate that they really do not want any bill at all, and are merely keeping up the pressure in an effort to see if they can get the Senate or industry to accept tougher provisions.', 'Senate Democrats (including Murray, Bingaman, and Breaux) are not accepting any possible amendments to the original Senate bill, and are opposed to changing the Senate bill at all.', 'However, Senator Murray and Republican Senator Slade Gorton (who has a tough election) both want to continue to pursue the Senate bill (unamended) as a rider to an omnibus/appropriations bill.', 'The White House is looking to cover itself from a poor performance in the House, and is considering drafting an executive order that could be issued if no legislation passes at all.', 'It is unclear what could or would be contained in such an order, but the White House is indicating to Senate staff that it would be more like the Senate bill than the House bill.', 'We are working with sources close to the White House to confirm their strategy.', 'Strategy going forward:Upon hearing that some industry associations were on Capitol Hill discussing \"what industry could live with\" in terms of provisions added to the Senate bill, I insisted (along with El Paso and others) that we not take such an approach, but rather remain consistent in our approach -- we support the Senate bill and only the Senate bill.', 'It was approved unanimously in the Senate and by 60% of the House, and if anything moves forward on an omnibus/appropriations bill, it should be the Senate bill.', 'Consistent with what our Senate friends are doing, we should not even recognize the Dingell/Oberstar legislation as a serious proposal, nor start accepting pieces of it as a compromise.', 'We will be shoring up support for our position of \"if anything moves forward, it should be the Senate bill only\" with Senate supporters and leadership in the House and Senate.', 'We will also be working to thank the 51 Democrats who supported us in the House, and make sure they have any cover they need in case their vote becomes an issue.', \"In support of Senator Gorton's election troubles, we will be working to try to get media placement of op-eds that support the efforts he has waged and make sure the House Democrats shoulder the blame for the bill's defeat.\", 'In particular, we are hopeful that Senator McCain (who has been passionate about this issue) will write op-eds that can be placed to support Gorton and others in tough races who supported the Senate bill.', \"Congress' state of confusion over omnibus/appropriations bills and last minute politics causes the legislative activity to be extremely fluid and subject to change rapidly, so we will have no real certainty until the session is over (which now could be as late as October 20).\", 'I will keep you posted as changes and developments occur.', 'Jeff', 'Look forward to seeing you.', 'Sorry I left Jimmy off the note, I know he must be

The language we inserted in the Interior Appropriations Bill, which has been agreed to by the Conferees, forces both agencies to revert back to the published fee schedules, prevents them from implementing any new policies in FY 2001, and forces them to work with industry and to come up with a common policy for future rent determination.', \"The reference in the opening sentence to gravitationally-challenged women is because the issue still hasn't quite closed.\", 'The Interior Appropriations Bill may very well be vetoed.', \"But since our issue was settled at the staff level, and is now off the table, we're likely to remain safe from being re-examined and challenged.\", 'In fact, any changes would likely only increase the strength of our hand: some members of our coalition are trying to insert even more detailed language in the report that prescribes exactly how the agencies will proceed to determine the new rental fee schedules over the next 18 months.', \"Through outside consultants, we've had a series of constructive discussions with the agencies over the past two weeks that have forged agreements on timing and specific ways forward.\", 'Details are forthcoming, but Enron would be involved closely in the process.', 'The agencies were clearly surprised by the clout we wielded, and are now more than willing to negotiate.', 'But the bottom line, again, is that we have stopped both agencies from implementing their costly interim policies or launching a rule making process either now (which they originally intended to do) or in the coming fiscal year.', \"And by engaging key Members of Congress and the White House, and organizing and leading the 20-member  Fiber Optic Public Land Right-of-Way Coalition, we've succeeded in branding

hopes of working things out before it is too late, even while through OPIC and EXIM it is supporting the move towards PNT.', 'The administration may be concerned that without such a diplomatic overture on its part it could be concluded that the USG has politically taken a position on the project.', 'In Trakya, for example, the USG has been quite proactive in pressing the Turkish govt on the payments issue and even in discussing the payment concerns with the IMF so that the payments issues for the BOTs (two of the four in Turkey are US sponsored) are taken into account as the IMF program

this section use the file      at the end of the section)      Critics Say U.S. Energy Agency Is Weak in Oversight of Utilities      By JEFF GERTH and JOSEPH KAHN      03/23/2001      The New York Times      Page 1, Column 1      c. 2001 New York Times Company      WASHINGTON, March 22 -- The pressure was intense when federal      regulators met      privately last month to debate remedies for soaring electricity      prices in      California.', \"Officials of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency      whose mandate      is to ensure ''just and reasonable'' electricity rates nationwide,      had evidence      that a few companies had been selling electricity to California at      prices far      above the cost of generating it.\", 'The agency faced an imminent      deadline to      challenge those prices or let the companies possibly pocket hundreds      of millions      of dollars in unfair profits.', 'An internal memorandum laid out two choices.', \"The agency could audit      and punish      ''bad actors,'' the companies that were exploiting the market.\", \"Or it      could      identify ''bad hours,'' when electricity shortages were most acute      and spiking      prices were arguably nobody's fault, and order refunds for only the      most      exorbitant prices.\", \"''It may be easier to identify bad hours than bad actors,'' the      memorandum said.\", 'The commission took the easier way.', \"It decided not to investigate      reports of      abuses by companies, but issued an order that could require them to      refund to      the state utilities up to $124 million collected during a relatively      few ''bad      hours'' in January and February.\", \"That is hundreds of millions of      dollars less      than California might have claimed, since the most potential      overcharging      occurred during ''good hours,'' when power was more plentiful but      prices were      often just as extreme.\", 'The order ignored those hours.', \"Today, in a criticism of the agency's lack of aggressiveness,      California      regulators estimated that generators had charged $6.2 billion above      competitive      levels over 10 months.\", 'They urged the agency to dig deeper, hoping it      would      demand more refunds or other stiff remedies.', \"But the agency's track      record --      one of complacency in the eyes of state officials -- leaves      California      regulators skeptical that Washington will confront the big power      producers.\", \"The small, obscure agency, tucked behind the rail yard of Union      Station here,      has largely soft-pedaled its role as the electricity industry's top      cop, even      though it has wide authority to keep power companies in line.\", 'To keep      rates      reasonable, it can impose price caps, strip companies of the right to      charge      market rates, force them to return excessive profits and even suspend      deregulation altogether.', 'Instead, the agency has largely left it to private companies to pry      open the      $250 billion electricity industry, which has historically been      controlled by      monopoly utilities and state officials.', \"The agency's defenders,      including its      chairman, Curt Hebert Jr., a fierce advocate of unfettered markets,      say that its      largely hands-off approach reflects the delicate balancing of      competing      interests -- a commitment to protect consumers while not stifling      market forces.\", \"But politicians, utility executives, energy economists and local      regulators say      California's rolling blackouts and skyrocketing electricity prices      are the signs      of a market running amok.\", 'They accuse the agency of standing aside as      companies      manipulate their way to windfall profits.', \"The agency's critics, who      include one      of its own commissioners and numerous staff members, say that its      enforcement      mission has been blunted by free-market passions and the influence of      industry      insiders in its ranks.\", 'When the agency began its first national investigation of high      electricity      prices last year, it named a newly recruited industry insider, Scott      Miller, to      lead the effort.', \"Mr. Miller and his colleagues said in their report      that there      was ''insufficient data'' in California to prove any profiteering by      generating      companies.\", 'Yet his own former employer, PG&E Energy Trading, was at      the time a      subject of a civil antitrust investigation by the Justice Department      that      focused on electricity market abuses in New England.', 'The agency has given state regulators a lead role in monitoring local      power      markets.', 'Yet even as these regulators have urged the agency to be      more      aggressive in investigating suspicions that companies have abused      their power in      California, New England, the Midwest and the mid-Atlantic, they have      frequently      been ignored or rebuffed.', 'Critics say that the agency began deregulation before it was ready or      willing to      make sure the markets worked effectively.', 'They accuse it of showing      favoritism      to industry -- allowing companies, for example, to ignore      requirements to file      detailed reports of market transactions that are critical to proving      accusations      of market abuses.', \"''We need to wake up to the fact that this is a dysfunctional market      that is      being gamed and manipulated by those who participate in it,'' said      William      Massey, a commissioner of the agency who has become one of its      leading critics.\", \"The agency's inaction, the critics say, leads to ''gaming'' --      jockeying for      profits that does not necessarily involve illegality -- and outright      market      manipulation.\", 'Consumers and utilities are the victims, paying      billions of      dollars more for electricity than if the markets were truly      competitive.', 'Agency officials acknowledge that enforcement of market rules to curb      gaming and      manipulation had not been a high priority in previous years.', 'But they      defended      their recent California order as proof that they intend to keep      markets free of      abuse.', 'They add that the agency is also pressuring two generators to      refund      almost $11 million for possibly manipulating the California market      last spring.', 'Agency officials and some outside analysts say that poorly conceived      deregulation plans by states, a shortage of power plants, rising      natural gas      prices, and even the weather have had more impact on electricity      prices than      abuses by companies or any failings by the agency.', 'They say the      agency must      balance the competing interests of generators, local regulators and      utility      companies if it is to keep deregulation on track.', \"''We're trying to craft a system that gives breathing room to develop      a market,      but not so much room that undue market power punishes consumers,''      Mr. Hebert      said.\", \"Fight Over Deregulation      Today's debate traces back to the 1930's, when President Franklin D.      Roosevelt      backed legislation to break up utility monopolies.\", \"The Federal Power      Act of 1935      gave the Federal Power Commission a mandate to ensure ''just and      reasonable''      electricity rates.\", 'The Federal Power Commission was abolished in 1977      and      replaced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, an independent      agency with      1,200 employees that also oversees oil pipelines and the natural gas      market.', 'The      president appoints the chairman and four commissioners -- two      Democrats and two      Republicans with staggered terms of five years.', 'Two Republican seats      are      currently unfilled.', \"The deregulation of the electricity markets began in the late 1980's,      after the      agency had begun opening the gas markets.\", 'By 1996, the commissioners      issued a      landmark order that forced utility companies to open their      transmission lines to      other utilities and electricity wholesalers.', 'The commission and many      private      economists expected that by prying open protected markets,      electricity prices      would immediately fall.', 'That possibility set off a deregulation frenzy, most prominently in      California,      New York, New England and the mid-Atlantic states.', 'Generating      companies rushed      to expand in the new, borderless market.', \"But the agency's balancing act has grown more difficult as      electricity      deregulation has spread nationwide.\", 'Congress has forced it to trim      its staff in      recent years.', 'Officials complain that investigating abuses in      electricity      markets strains their resources.', 'And as the California crisis has worsened, the commissioners have      begun sparring      publicly among themselves about what to do.', 'This week, Mr. Massey, a      Democratic      commissioner, and Mr. Hebert (pronounced AY-bear), a Republican, sat      side by      side before a House panel and argued diametrically opposed positions.', \"Mr. Hebert      said high prices in California ''were sending the right signals to      get supply      there.''\", \"Mr. Massey called the prices that generators were charging      ''unlawful''      and said that his agency, by not reining them in, ''is simply not      doing its      job.''\", \"The agency's leadership has been in flux for months.\", 'Congressional      and industry      officials in Washington say President Bush is considering replacing      Mr. Hebert,      whom he named to the top post less than two months ago, with Pat      Wood, who runs      the Texas public utility commission.', 'A White House spokeswoman had no      comment on      the reports.', \"Though Mr. Hebert's positions are not far from those of the Bush      administration,      his relations with California leaders may have made his position      tenuous.\", 'Mr.      Hebert, a Mississippian who is a close ally of the Senate majority      leader, Trent      Lott, has warred with California politicians who have proposed new      solutions to      the crisis there.', 'Mr. Hebert, who has served as a commissioner since 1997, has often      taken the      most ideologically free-market position of any commissioner.', 'He      flatly rejects      the idea of price caps on electricity as hopelessly ineffective and      contrary to      market forces.', 'When Gov.', \"Gray Davis outlined a plan to have the state      buy      transmission lines to relieve utility companies' debt, Mr. Hebert's      response was      dismissive.\", \"''It's not in the interest of the American public,'' he      pronounced.\", 'Even as new electricity markets opened in the summer of 1999, they      started      producing nasty shocks.', 'The mid-Atlantic region experienced some      early      volatility.', \"As the turmoil grew, economists began raising the alarm about a      phenomenon      called ''market power,'' the ability of energy traders in the new      national      market to sustain prices above the competitive level.\", 'Proving such      abuses is      difficult, because it requires comparing tens of thousands of      separate      electricity transactions with the costs of the generators that      initiated them.', 'Joseph Bowring, who heads the market monitoring unit of the nonprofit      entity      that operates the mid-Atlantic transmission system, said that power      companies      there had exercised some market power.', 'But only the Federal Energy      Regulatory      Commission, not local regulators, had the authority to collect the      data to      determine how much market power had been exercised and whether it had      been      abusive or not, he said.', 'Mr. Bowring said he talked to agency officials about doing so.', 'In the      end, Mr.      Bowring and several agency officials said, the agency chose not to      investigate.', 'The decision roiled some agency officials.', \"Ron Rattey, a veteran agency economist, wrote a memorandum last June      describing      the staff as ''impotent in our ability to monitor, foster, and ensure      competitive electric power markets.''\", 'The staff, the memorandum said,      did not      even enforce a requirement that power companies file detailed      quarterly reports      listing essentially every sale they make.', 'Such data would have been      useful to      Mr. Bowring.', 'Local-Federal Clash      Local regulators who want to ensure competitive prices often have to      act on      their own.', 'Monitors in New England have intervened about 600 times      since 1999 to      correct prices they determined had been caused, at least in part, by      market      manipulation.', 'The federal agency has sometimes chastised them for interfering too      much.', 'The industry, not surprisingly, shares that view.', 'One vocal critic      was Mr.      Miller.', 'Before the agency recruited him last July to head its      division of energy      markets, he was director of policy coordination for the national      energy-trading      unit of PG&E Corporation, the California holding company whose assets      also      include Pacific Gas and Electric, the California utility.', \"Although the utility has lost billions of dollars during California's      crisis,      Mr. Miller's former unit has become one of the most profitable new      energy      traders nationwide.\", 'PG&E Energy Trading, by several estimates, is now      the      second-largest seller of electricity in New England.', 'The company has had a rocky relationship with regulators.', 'They      intervened      several times in 1999 and 2000 to retroactively cancel auctions they      said      produced excessive profits for PG&E and other companies.', \"Mr. Miller      denounced      the practice, though he acknowledged in public testimony that his      company      sometimes charged ''very high'' prices when it could.\", \"''One person's predatory pricing is another person's competitive      advantage,''      Mr. Miller said at a public hearing on deregulation in Texas in 1999.\", \"New      England regulators too often acted as ''judge, jury and executioner''      when      overseeing the market, he said.\", \"One year later, Mr. Miller and his new colleagues at the federal      agency got a      chance to examine New England's problems from the regulators'      perspective.\", \"Their      Nov. 1 report attributed New England's frequent price gyrations to      technical and      regulatory flaws.\", \"As Mr. Miller's team was preparing its report, the Justice      Department, whose      threshold for stepping into possible industry wrongdoing is far      higher than the      agency's, began looking into whether price spikes in New England      pointed to      unlawful monopoly power or collusion, people contacted by the      department during      that inquiry said.\", \"One subject of the civil inquiry is possible price manipulation in      one of New      England's ancillary services markets, people contacted by the      department said.\", 'They said the department was examining whether PG&E and two other      companies      tried to corner that market for several months early last year.', \"PG&E      confirmed      that the Justice Department had contacted it, but denies wrongdoing      and says it      has cooperated with the department's requests.\", 'Mr. Miller has declined to comment on his role at PG&E or at the      agency.', 'His      supervisors defended his work and said they had detected no conflict      of interest      between his work at PG&E and his duties at the agency.', 'Those duties brought Mr. Miller to California last August.', \"With      electricity      prices there soaring, he and his colleagues sat down with several      utility      executives at the agency's San Francisco office.\", 'One executive, Gary Stern, director of market monitoring for Southern      California      Edison, wanted the agency to stop what he suspected were market      abuses by power      generators.', 'He provided a road map to help investigators figure out      how power      companies traded power contracts -- and whether they had manipulated      the      markets.', 'But when Mr. Miller and his team approached 11 generators and      marketers --      including his old employer -- a few weeks later, they did it their      way.', \"They      asked eight questions, many of them imprecise, like: ''Describe your      strategy      for bidding generation resources into market.''\", \"This question, Mr. Stern said in a recent interview, ''was equivalent      to asking      a suspected burglar how he spent his day.''\", 'Some agency officials also thought the team should probe deeper.', 'Mr.      Rattey      recommended that Mr. Miller seek the quarterly pricing reports that      marketers      were supposed to file.', 'But his suggestion was not adopted, agency      records show.', \"Daniel Larcamp, Mr. Miller's supervisor, said ''there might have been      more      information that could have been obtained'' in the California      inquiry.\", 'But he      said the commission gave the staff only three months to finish,      making it      impossible to collect and analyze the reams of data involved.', 'For Mr. Miller, agency documents show, the investigation was so      time-consuming      that he had no time to fill out the financial disclosure form      required of new      federal employees.', 'Mr. Miller submitted his form in late January,      after a      reporter requested it.', 'Agency lawyers approved the form, but only      after he      provided additional information about his job and compensation from      PG&E.', \"The      lawyers said Mr. Miller's participation had been permissible because      PG&E was      not the subject of the investigation.\", 'When the staff report was issued on Nov. 1, it found high prices and      problems in      the design of the California market.', \"But while the companies ''had      the potential      to exercise market power,'' the commission said, there was      ''insufficient data''      to prove that they did.\", 'Some marketers saw the report as an exoneration.', \"''This has been looked at several times, most notably by the FERC and      nobody has      found any evidence of market manipulation and profiteering,'' Rob      Doty, the      chief financial officer of Dynegy Inc., told a reporter earlier this      year.\", 'California Inquiry      The agency has recently shown signs of wanting to apply pressure on      generators.', 'But its early efforts show how it is treading on new and uncertain      turf.', 'When the California crisis grew severe last December, the commission      issued a      refund order, a shot across the bow for generators charging high      prices.', 'It      required them to submit detailed data any time they sold electricity      in      California for more than $150 per megawatt hour, considered at the      time a fair      estimate of the highest costs any of them faced.', 'It also told generators that for the next several months, they could      be forced      to give refunds if the agency found that they had charged excessive      prices.', 'The      commission also said that it would examine bidding practices and      strategies for      withholding generating capacity to ferret out any efforts to      artificially raise      prices.', \"When the agency's own 60-day deadline for examining market data in      January      approached, however, it became clear that staff members had not made      any      detailed examination.\", 'Instead, staff members said, the agency      scrambled to forge      a last-minute compromise that would allow it to issue a statement      opposing high      prices in the state without a time-consuming investigation.', 'During this scramble, a senior staff member, Kevin Kelly, suggested      focusing on      bad hours instead of bad actors.', \"''Our attempts to find illegal behavior or legal 'misbehavior' by      sellers ('bad      actors') always seems to fail,'' his memorandum said.\", 'It said that      the agency      could more easily blame high prices on acute shortages during the      most critical      hours.', 'The suggestion won the day.', 'The commission decided to limit its order      to the      hours when California declared a Stage 3 emergency, when supplies are      critically      low.', 'Mr. Stern of Southern California Edison and several private-sector      economists      have attacked the economic logic of that order.', 'They said that the      commission      has focused on times when prices might be legitimately high.', 'The      bigger worry:      Generators can and often do sustain artificially high prices when      supplies are      not as tight, they say.', 'Mr. Massey, the Democratic commissioner, dissented from the decision      for those      reasons.', \"Because most high-priced transactions in January and      February did not      occur during bad hours, he argued, the commission effectively chose      to bless as      ''just and reasonable'' the hefty profits generators are making from      the      California crisis.\", \"''The problem with my agency is that we're so carried away with the      rhetoric of      markets that we've gotten sloppy,'' Mr. Massey said.\", \"''We're talking      about      electricity.\", \"It's the juice of the economy, so it's got to be      available and      reasonably priced.''\", 'Williams defends pricing of electricity      03/23/2001      Associated Press Newswires      Copyright 2001.',

       " 'As you\\'ll recall these were:a) to get the BLM to withdraw any \"interim\" policies, the first of which split fiber cables into 144 different ROW certifications, and a later version that re-packaged the issue, mandating that ROW certificates be issued each time a fiber owner subleases or sells capacity on its line, with a retroactivity clause that added extra sting;b) to get the Forest Service to retract its May 2nd memorandum which changed its fiber optic ROW policy from published fee schedules to individual \"comparable\" assessments (the first such assessment, which compared ROW fees in urban centers in downtown Portland and Seattle to Oregon forest lands, increased the cost of a segment of our FTV fiber build 150 fold);c) to block both agencies from implementing any proposed or final rule in FY 2001; andd) to create an open rule making process that involves all interested stakeholders, including Enron.',\n",
       " 'Thanks to the considerable pressure we orchestrated from Congress and the Administration, BLM Director Fry and USFS Chief Dombeck have backed away from points a and b above, and have agreed to points c and d.   The language we inserted in the Interior Appropriations Bill, which has been agreed to by the Conferees, forces both agencies to revert back to the published fee schedules, prevents them from implementing any new policies in FY 2001, and forces them to work with industry and to come up with a common policy for future rent determination.',\n",
       " \"The reference in the opening sentence to gravitationally-challenged women is because the issue still hasn't quite closed.\",\n",
       " 'The Interior Appropriations Bill may very well be vetoed.',\n",

       " \"Through outside consultants, we've had a series of constructive discussions with the agencies over the past two weeks that have forged agreements on timing and specific ways forward.\",\n",
       " 'Details are forthcoming, but Enron would be involved closely in the process.',\n",
       " 'The agencies were clearly surprised by the clout we wielded, and are now more than willing to negotiate.',\n",
       " 'But the bottom line, again, is that we have stopped both agencies from implementing their costly interim policies or launching a rule making process either now (which they originally intended to do) or in the coming fiscal year.',\n",

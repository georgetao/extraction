That <br/>conceivably could be someone's full-time job, given the vast amount of <br/>confidential and proprietary projects at issue just within EWS.  <br/><br/>I do agree that we need to put some protocols in place with regard to how <br/>Enron handles different levels of confidential information (including trade <br/>secrets).  Rather than have an ongoing commission guided by outside counsel, <br/>I would suggest that Pete, Scott Tholan, the IT security team, internal <br/>corporate security, as well as legal subject matter experts get together to <br/>put forth guidelines on how information should be retained and protected.  <br/>Those guidelines would describe the type of information at issue and the <br/>corresponding security measures to put in place to protect that material.  <br/>For example, trading positions and curves would have one standard for access <br/>and disclosure, while personnel information would have a different one.  The <br/>benefit to this approach is that we can set the guidelines and manage on a <br/>periodic basis to make sure that they are followed, rather than create <br/>updated inventories.  <br/><br/>It also presumably would save on outside counsel fees.  I would not view this <br/>type of approach as requiring much, if any, assistance from outside counsel.<br/><br/>Let me know your thoughts.<br/><br/>Michelle<br/><br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>---------------------------<br/><br/>Michelle Cash<br/>Enron North America Corp.<br/>1400 Smith Street, EB 3823<br/>Houston, Texas  77002<br/>(713) 853-6401<br/>michelle.cash@enron.com<br/><br/>This message may contain confidential information that is protected by the <br/>attorney-client and/or work product privileges.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Mark E Haedicke<br/> 04/11/01 03:00 PM<br/>   <br/>   To: Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT<br/>   cc: Mark Holsworth/Enron@EnronXGate<br/>   Subject: <br/><br/>How would we do this efficiently in EWS?

I have <br/>visited with Jim Derrick about having a legal/business committee representing <br/>your major groups.  It would function in a similar manner as our Y2K <br/>committee did.  We would have Fulbright & Jaworski give our people general <br/>instructions, our business people would canvass our companies to determine <br/>what we considered proprietary trade secrets and if we were not protecting <br/>our proprietary information appropriately, we could address that issue.  <br/>Fulbright could also be used on an ad hoc basis.   Costs would be shared <br/>proportionately between the major groups except special fees attributable to <br/>a specific operating group.<br/> <br/>  I believe we need this inventory.  If we try to enforce our non-competition <br/>agreements and we can't prove that we kept such information on a need to know <br/>basis and properly secured, we could lose the law suit.  <br/><br/>  Jim asked that I contact each of you regarding this to see if you were in <br/>agreement with the proposed plan.

I have <br/>been directly responsible for the creation of the business strategy/plan (and <br/>its changes), the pro-forma financial statements and projections that <br/>permutate with the strategy, key strategic alliances with best of breed <br/>industry participants, venture capital raising process for three series of <br/>funding, the Investment Banking presentations/diligence/IPO work.<br/><br/>I currently head up all of the Chematch.com content, information and <br/>analytics efforts, for both cash and paper markets.? I also head up <br/>Petrochem.net, the sister company within Chematch.com.<br/><br/>Prior to joining Enron, I graduated from the University of Chicago with a <br/>Master of Business Administration in Analytic Finance and Accounting.? Prior <br/>to b-school, I worked on Wall Street for 3 1/2 years in investment banking <br/>and capital markets.<br/><br/>Attached is a copy of my resume.? My goal is to procure a challenging <br/>leadership position within your group in the capacity of Business <br/>Developement, Corporate Finance, Mergers & Acquisition, or Venture Capital.? <br/>I would be open to other suggestions.<br/><br/>Please review my resume when you get a chance.?

I continue to serve on the <br/>board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for <br/>this year's fundraising efforts.<br/><br/>As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  <br/>Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the <br/>multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot <br/>imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking <br/>insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of <br/>complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it <br/>they would die.<br/><br/>Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF <br/>is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money <br/>raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise <br/><mark>$225,000 and we need your help.</mark>  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 <br/>years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team <br/>leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the <br/>walk this year is \"Knock Out Diabetes\" and we would like to have you join us <br/>for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron <br/>people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.<br/><br/>If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if <br/>you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee <br/>members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please <br/>contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included <br/>in the first important and informative training session taking place this <br/>week.<br/><br/>Thank you very much for your support.<br/><br/>Mike McConnell<br/><br/>Steering Committee Members:<br/><br/>Blanca Bollom X66091<br/>Rachel Feldt  X57629<br/>Deb Gebhardt X39606<br/>Cathy Phillips X36898<br/>John Walt  X35379<br/>Debbie Yates X35305<br/><br/>   <br/><br/><br/><br/>\n",

The <br/>former measuring facilities, the lateral, and the 8\" Crawford lateral were <br/>all sold to Duke.  TW measurement facilities do not exist at the interconnect <br/>that can be re-activated for EOG gas lift measurement/regulation.  Should EOG <br/>desire to receive lift gas from TW, then new measuring and regulating <br/>facilities will be required.  See Figure 1 below for connection details.<br/><br/>However, expected operating pressures available on the 16\" Crawford lateral <br/>is common to suction pressures observed at the suction of WT-1 Compressor <br/>Station that varies between 580 - 630 psig (see Figure 2, daily average <br/>pressure graph for May-Oct 2000).  As you indicated that EOG's line pressure <br/>would be near 650 psig, it will not be possible for TW to deliver into EOG <br/>unless they can lower their line pressure to about 550 psig or add <br/>compression.  <br/><br/>If feasibility exists for EOG to add compression and you would like for me to <br/>proceed with providing a Level \"A\" cost estimate for measuring/regulating <br/><mark>facilities, please reply or give me a call.</mark>  Eric - 713/853-3395<br/><br/><br/>Figure 1:  Connection Details for former Highland-Pecos Irrigation Co.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Figure 2: Average Daily Pressure, WT-1 Suction<br/>\n",

This may be setting up to be a larger asset <br/>management transaction.  <mark>Don can you try and find a time next week with Lew</mark> <br/>for me to have dinner - get Beverly to schedule the plane to get me in and <br/>out that day.  If not next week then early the following.  I think it will <br/>take a one on one with Lew to get this one centered.<br/><br/>At our meeting, I would also like a status update on the other iniatives eg) <br/>Ameren, DPL, Cinergy, etc.<br/><br/>The accounting issues on the generation projects need to be addressed as well.<br/><br/>Regards<br/>Delainey<br/>---------------------- Forwarded by David W Delainey/HOU/ECT on 07/20/2000 <br/>12:17 PM ---------------------------<br/><br/><br/>Don Miller<br/>07/20/2000 11:01 AM<br/>To: David W Delainey/HOU/ECT@ECT<br/>cc: Jeff Donahue/HOU/ECT@ECT <br/>Subject: FPL Update<br/><br/>Dave,<br/><br/>As I mentioned in my voicemail last night, I spoke with Randy and Aldo.  The <br/>tone was positive, and they said Goldman was very bullish on the whole <br/>story.  All these guys acknowledge that without our Trading stamp on NewCo, <br/>NewCo will not be a world class Genco.  With that said, it is apparent that <br/>Lew is telling these guys to go back and get more EXACT detail on what <br/>exactly Enron is willing to do in terms of people (both Trading and Risk <br/>Management). I would have to believe that a conversation between you and Lew <br/>would go a long way in making him comfortable that we are truly committed to <br/>NewCo, particularly with $400-$500 million of equity tied up in this entity.  <br/>Apparently we have to arm Lew with everything that he needs to go to <br/>Broadhead to argue why NewCo makes sense and why they need Enron in this <br/>entity.  I have tried to convince these guys that while Trading is people, it <br/>is also philosophy, style and approach.  Given that we have said that we <br/>would nominate the Head Trader, I have tried to convey that we might be <br/>looking to utilize a lot of FPLE T&M people, but immerse them in our <br/>philosophy.  They are not comfortable with this, and have informed me that <br/>coming back with the answer that we will only put one Enron person in Trading <br/>is probably not the right answer.  Given the dynamic nature of Enron and <br/>Trading in general,  making a huge commitment of people I would imagine will <br/>be tough.<br/><br/>We talked through many other aspects including whether they think that they <br/>can do an IPO without us; the fact that having our involvement clearly <br/>increases the value of NewCo (raises an interesting question about how we get <br/>adequately compensated for this);  tight labor market in general and the fact <br/>that we don't have unlimited human resources here at Enron; and that in the <br/>early years, NewCo has very little merchant generation, and that all of it is <br/>FPLE 's (implies fewer people needed, and that we should be able to utilize <br/>FPLE Traders).  We also discussed the rumor about FPL's interest in Aquilla.<br/><br/>Sorry to bog down your vacation with this.  If you want to talk today, I will <br/>be around.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>Don <br/>713-853-0492 (ph)<br/>713-412-8967 (cell)<br/>\n",

The Purchase and Sale Agreement (\"PSA\") for each asset has now been<br/>posted to DealBench under the New Document section.  <mark>Please review the</mark><br/>instructions attached to each PSA.<br/><br/>2. The Management Presentations (with audio) have now been posted to<br/>DealBench under the Management Presentation(strikethrough: s) section.<br/>When attempting to view the presentation, please log onto DealBench using<br/>Microsoft Internet Explorer. Once in DealBench, you will most likely need<br/>to download \"Flash Player\" (free download).  You can do this by clicking<br/>\"Macromedia Flash Player download center\" in the Linked Documents section<br/>of DealBench.  The download usually takes less than 30 seconds.  After the<br/>download, return to the Management Presentation section of DealBench and<br/>click on the Management Presentation (with audio).   A power point<br/>presentation has also been included in the Management Presentation section<br/>of DealBench.   A detailed instruction guide \"Instruction for Viewing<br/>Management Presentation\" has been posted in New Document section of<br/>DealBench.<br/><br/>3.  Please be sure to consistently review the New Documents section on<br/>DealBench for any new documents that have been added to DealBench.  Also, a<br/>running black line Due Diligence Index is posted in the Due Diligence Index<br/>/ Plant Pictures section of DealBench.<br/><br/>4. Any drawings or CDs that you need from the Due Diligence Indices may be<br/>requested by sending an email to don.miller@enron.com or jhoff2@enron.com.<br/><br/>5.

Three key changes:<br/>They clarified that the surcharge applies to Direct Access customers (but the <br/>entire \"rate freeze\" structure remains intact for now).<br/>The Commission reversed itself and chose not to adopt TURN's \"netting out\" of <br/>gen revenues and CTC collections, and said instead that the Commission will <br/>consider it as an option in the next phase (a move likely made in order to <br/>lower chances of a successful utility appeal).<br/>The Commission added to the decision language saying that it will study the <br/>pros/cons of securitizating the utilities' power purchase costs.  They will <br/>submit a report on the issue to the Governor and Legislature.<br/>On this last point, wire reports are rampant about the possibility that <br/>legislation will be introduced as early as today proposing to securitize the <br/>utilties' power purchase costs.  This action has reportedly been the result <br/>of discussions that occured through the night between the governor's office, <br/>the utilities and the ratings agencies in reponse to the fact that the <br/>decision issued by the PUC falls well short of what's needed to keep the IOUs <br/>credit worthy and solvent.  As a result of those wires stories, the <br/>utilities' stock has come back (Edison was down as low as 6.25 and is <br/>currently at 10 7/8; PG&E was at 8 7/8 and is currently at 11 7/8).  We're <br/>working with Sandi McCubbin, who heads-up our legislative activities in <br/>California, to get more info and will report back.<br/>The hearing was dominated by highly charged anti-generator, anti-marketer <br/>rhetoric, which is likely to play a prominent role in the press accounts.  <br/>Only FERC was demonized more.<br/>Each of the Commissioners, including the most recent \"interim\" appointee,  <br/>made strong statements regarding the undesirability of utility bankruptcy.<br/>The Commission left open the possibility of \"doing more\" at their next <br/>meeting (two weeks from today), which means the negotiations with the <br/>utilities and ratings agencies are likely to continue. And if an agreement is <br/>reached, it could end up on the next agenda.<br/><br/>\n",

The 300 MW would be generated by the two gas turbines at <br/>about 100 MW each and the remaining 100 MW coming from the steam turbine. The <br/>steam turbine receives its energy from the exit gases from the gas turbines <br/>and they both contribute equally to the resulting steam turbine output <br/>(theoretically at least, in practice depending on optimization of machines)<br/><br/>Again, please talk with Lucio.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Christiaan<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rob G Gay@ENRON<br/>12/18/2000 04:41 PM<br/>To: Laine A Powell/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Christiaan <br/>Huizer/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Richard A Lammers/SA/Enron@Enron<br/>cc: Tracee Bersani/HOU/ECT@ECT <br/>Subject: EPE Dispatch<br/><br/>Here is what we have concluded based on discussions this morning:<br/><br/>1) We believe that Furnas has agreed to contract and pay for 300 MW on oil to <br/>meet regulatory requirements concerning required capacity and reserve <br/>margin.  We do not believe that they intend for us to be dispatrched above <br/>220 MW. (Do we have any document which could substantiate this?)<br/><br/>2) Although  dispatch on a merit order basis would suggest that EPE runs full <br/>time (with 300 MW available),  there are practical constraints in the <br/>transmission system which will prohibit this from actually occuring. [ Please <br/>describe these constraints using some official sounding jargon but minimal <br/>detail and in particular indicate what is involved to de-bottleneck and how <br/>long this will take.  I presume that Furnas is solely responsible for the <br/>corrective measures.]<br/><br/>3) Based on our analysis, the optimal operating approach would be to generate <br/>220MW with  one turbine and 91 MW with the other for a total of 311 if <br/>dipatched above 220 MW.<br/><br/>If we can prove that 1) & 2) are correct or convince the lenders that they <br/>are, then I think we can suggest that fuel oil exposure is negligibe if gas <br/>is ready by April 01.  We will have to see how it looks when we add the Sue <br/>Garvin flex months.<br/><br/>Therefore, a merit order analysis is only necessary if i) our supposition <br/>about Furnas' motivations are incorrect and/or ii) the transmission problem <br/>is cleared.  If this happens it would be nice to be able to predict reduced <br/>fuel utilization due to a) reduced dispatch during daily off-peak hours or <br/>seasonal impacts, b) due to scheduled outages, and c) due to managing our <br/>availabilty in such a way as to reduce fuel consumption operating losses.  <br/>Any data you can provide will be helpful.<br/><br/><br/>Have I successfully connected the dots here?<br/><br/>If you have previously sent these materials to Felipe or Tracee please simply <br/>grumble to yourself if you have to do an extra e-mail to me.  Remember, you <br/>don't have to be nice to a short timer unless you need them to get something <br/>done.<br/><br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Rob<br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/>\n",

      "Mon, 18 Sep 2000 18:42:47<br/><br/>Your  subscription to  the FRBNYRMAG1  list (Federal  Reserve Bank  of NY<br/>Research Publications) has been accepted.<br/><br/>Please save this message for future  reference, especially if this is the<br/>first time you are subscribing to an electronic mailing list. If you ever<br/>need to leave  the list, you will find the  necessary instructions below.<br/>Perhaps  more importantly,  saving a  copy of  this message  (and of  all<br/>future subscription notices  from other mailing lists) in  a special mail<br/>folder will give you instant access to the list of mailing lists that you<br/>are subscribed  to. This may  prove very useful the  next time you  go on<br/>vacation and  need to leave  the lists temporarily so  as not to  fill up<br/>your  mailbox while  you  are away!  You should  also  save the  \"welcome<br/>messages\" from the  list owners that you will  occasionally receive after<br/>subscribing to a new list.<br/><br/><mark>To send  a message to  all the people  currently subscribed to  the list,</mark><br/>just  send  mail  to   FRBNYRMAG1@PEACH.EASE.LSOFT.COM.  This  is  called<br/>\"sending mail to the list,\" because you send mail to a single address and<br/>LISTSERV  makes copies  for  all  the people  who  have subscribed.  This<br/>address  (FRBNYRMAG1@PEACH.EASE.LSOFT.COM)  is   also  called  the  \"list<br/>address.\" You must never  try to send any command to  that address, as it<br/>would be distributed to all the  people who have subscribed. All commands<br/>must be sent to the \"LISTSERV address,\" LISTSERV@PEACH.EASE.LSOFT.COM. It<br/>is  very important  to understand  the  difference between  the two,  but<br/>fortunately it  is not complicated.  The LISTSERV  address is like  a FAX<br/>number that connects you to a machine, whereas the list address is like a<br/>normal voice line connecting  you to a person. If you  make a mistake and<br/>dial the FAX number when you wanted  to talk to someone on the phone, you<br/>will quickly  realize that you used  the wrong number and  call again. No<br/>harm will have been done. If on the other hand you accidentally make your<br/>FAX call  someone's voice  line, the  person receiving  the call  will be<br/>inconvenienced, especially if your FAX then re-dials every 5 minutes. The<br/>fact that  most people  will eventually  connect the  FAX machine  to the<br/>voice line to  allow the FAX to  go through and make the  calls stop does<br/>not mean  that you  should continue  to send FAXes  to the  voice number.<br/>People would just get mad at you.  It works pretty much the same way with<br/>mailing  lists, with  the difference  that  you are  calling hundreds  or<br/>thousands of people  at the same time, and consequently  you can expect a<br/>lot of people to get upset if  you consistently send commands to the list<br/>address.<br/><br/>You may  leave the  list at  any time by  sending a  \"SIGNOFF FRBNYRMAG1\"<br/>command to LISTSERV@PEACH.EASE.LSOFT.COM. You  can also tell LISTSERV how<br/>you want it to  confirm the receipt of messages you send  to the list. If<br/>you do  not trust the system,  send a \"SET FRBNYRMAG1  REPRO\" command and<br/>LISTSERV will send you  a copy of your own messages, so  that you can see<br/>that the  message was  distributed and  did not get  damaged on  the way.<br/>After a while  you may find that this is  getting annoying, especially if<br/>your mail program does not tell you  that the message is from you when it<br/>informs you that new mail has arrived from FRBNYRMAG1. If you send a \"SET<br/>FRBNYRMAG1  ACK  NOREPRO\"  command,  LISTSERV   will  mail  you  a  short<br/>acknowledgement  instead,  which  will  look different  in  your  mailbox<br/>directory.

I am indifferent, but I know that the reason <br/>our accounting brethen made that comment, as well as the other comments they <br/>often make that seem counter-intuitive, is that it facilitates their efforts <br/>in ensuring that documents reflect off-balance sheet, soft costs related <br/>rather than on-balance sheet, hard costs.

Should I send these requests back directly to you, or do them <br/>through the system as well?<br/><br/>Also, there are two ways of getting edit access through this database.  One <br/>is for employees of Legal, who can then enter Legal comments, and the other <br/>is for employees of Credit, who can then enter Credit comments.  Do you see <br/>that choice?  Is there some way for me to verify which employees of Legal and <br/>which employees of Credit have what access?  I know that some employees of <br/>Credit have Legal access by mistake.  Can I get lists of the Legal and Credit <br/>breakdowns?<br/><br/><br/><br/> Enron Messaging Security@ENRON<br/> 02/27/2001 11:17 AM<br/>   <br/>   To: Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT<br/>   cc: <br/>   Subject: eRequests 20721 & 20740<br/><br/>Good morning,<br/><br/>Please provide the path to the Financial Trading Agreement database.

I have also drafted resolutions to be dated the<br/>day following closing to elect as directors the persons named in the Amended<br/>and Restated LLC Agreement (need the names of these persons - three<br/>designees of PPL and one designee of ENA) and to replace the officers of the<br/>LLC with persons designated by PPL.

This product will NOT bridge into Sitara and will <br/>have to be put in manually. <br/><br/>The reason it will not bridge is due to the fact that it can have multiple <br/>stripes of start & end dates rather than one start & end date. Currently, <br/>EnronOnline can<br/>only send one start & end date per deal therefore it will fail in the bridge <br/>monitor and will have to be manually entered into Sitara & subsequently <br/>cleared out of the monitor. <br/><br/>Since these transactions could flow next day, it is imperative that these <br/>transactions get into Sitara as soon as possible. Please read the FULL <br/>description below. (This product looks like a month long deal but excludes <br/>weekends. The \"Wkd\" is short for week days.)<br/><br/>We do not anticipate a large volume of these transactions but need to be <br/>prepared to react quickly when they do. For the future, we are looking into <br/>the cost/benefit of EnronOnline having the capability of sending multiple <br/>dates for these types of products.<br/><br/>If you have any questions, please call me at 3-5824<br/>Thank you. <br/>  <br/>---------------------- Forwarded by Jennifer deBoisblanc Denny/HOU/ECT on <br/>05/23/2000 02:05 PM ---------------------------<br/>Dale Neuner   05/23/2000 10:26 AM<br/><br/>To: David Forster/Corp/Enron@Enron, Sheri Thomas/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jennifer <br/>deBoisblanc Denny/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jason Althaus/Corp/Enron@Enron, Jason <br/>Althaus/Corp/Enron@Enron, Melba Lozano/HOU/ECT@ECT<br/>cc: Eric Bass/HOU/ECT@ECT <br/>Subject: 24 x 5 Products<br/><br/>We are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 Nat Gas Product commencing tomorrow, <br/>May 24th. <br/><br/>The Product is a month-long Physical Nat Gas Product traded off the Texas <br/>desk.

Open season giving all parties an equal shot to capacity is better than <br/>selective marketing.  However, once capacity is posted, a shipper is free to <br/>inquire about it and we should be free to solicit interest by picking up the <br/>phone.  I can research whether any pipeline got its hand slapped for <br/>selective marketing.<br/><br/>2.  I thought we had agreed that we need a separate provision that governs <br/>the allocation of capacity on TW's system apart from ROFR.  In the rewrite, <br/>we should add language that allows us to use any non-discriminatory <br/>allocation methodology as long as we give shippers advance notice by posting <br/>the methodology on our website.  Until then, Section 13 of the FTS-1 Rate <br/>Schedule is the only guidance we have.  \"All available capacity shall be <br/>allocated under these procedures...\"  The lottery only comes into play if <br/>there are two bids of equal value.  I think we could use pro-rata as an <br/>allocation methodology if we notified all parties on the website ahead of <br/>time.  <br/><br/>3.  I agree with you on the approval process for negotiated rates and no or <br/>limited approval for standard language max-rate deals.  Maria.     <br/> -----Original Message-----<br/>From:  Fossum, Drew  <br/>Sent: Tuesday, January 30, 2001 2:20 PM<br/>To: Harris, Steven; Hyatt, Kevin; Scott, Susan; Pavlou, Maria; Huber, Lee; <br/>Miller, Mary Kay; Hass, Glen<br/>Cc: Corman, Shelley<br/>Subject: TW<br/><br/>In the last several weeks several areas have come up where the TW commercial <br/>team could, in my opinion, use some clear written guidance on gray areas <br/>under the tariff ought to be interpreted.  Here is my list.  Please add items <br/>if I've missed any.<br/><br/>1.  When can TW \"selectively market\" available capacity?   I.e., if capacity <br/>is on the board as available, and no one has bought it, are there any limits <br/>on calling up a customer, or a group of customers, and pitching a deal?  I <br/>think we have a lot of discretion here--after all, using the telephone to <br/>talk to one customer is always \"selective\" since there's only one guy on the <br/>phone, not all our customers.  Also, can we deliberately leave a customer off <br/>the list of \"the usual suspects\" we call to pitch a special deal like an <br/>index to index deal or a discount?  I've asked Lee to pull together a quick <br/>analysis of this issue.  <br/><br/>2.  If we get multiple bids for a chunk of capacity outside of the open <br/>season context, how do we allocate it?  This is the situation we got into a <br/>couple of weeks ago on the '02 and '03 space.  Are we always required to use <br/>a lottery?  Do we need to modify the tariff to use pro rata, or can we use <br/>pro rata simply by notifying the customers in advance?<br/><br/>3.  What approval process applies to max rate contracts and negotiated rate <br/>contracts?  The ET&S discount approval procedure still applies to TW <br/>discounted deals (even there is no ET&S anymore).  I think all neg. rate <br/>deals should be approved by law and regulatory, but I don't need to see max <br/>rate strd language deals.    <br/>4.  ???  I think there was another issue, but I can't remember what it was.  <br/><br/>Thanks for your input on this.  DF<br/>\n",

It is <br/>based on the 3rd party contract that Jeff Hodge is working on with Peoples.  <br/>The agreement is intended to be a master contract that would facilitate a <br/>blanket of structured term transactions between the utilities (Peoples Gas <br/>Light and Coke Co. and North Shore Gas)  and MEH.  It will be filed with the <br/>Illinois Commerce Commission for approval.  My understanding is that the <br/>transactions will still be subject to the annual prudency process of each <br/>utility.  I am not sure your strategy on this one, but would think that a <br/>combination of you, Jeff Hodge, and Boyd would be most effective.  I <br/>understand that Dynegy and Nicor filed a similar agreement as part of their <br/>Hub Agency Agreement that Boyd has reviewed.

      "** Proprietary **<br/><br/>Michelle:  Thanks for sending this to me so quickly.  I do have a couple more questions for you.<br/><br/>1.  What is the discount rate you will be using to calculate the NPV in your open season?<br/><br/>2.  Can an affiliate of a company also place a bid for up to the volume available to Needles?<br/><br/>3.  How does the right of first refusal work?<br/><br/>For example, when we spoke earlier I think you used an example of a $3.00 bid for 1 year getting equal value as a $.30 bid for 10 years (adjusted for NPV, of course) and the winning party got a ROFR. (Let's say the 1 year bid won).  At the end of the year, is the ROFR calculated on the $3.00 value the shipper holds the transport at or is it based on current market conditions.  Let's say the market value has collapsed and the market views this capacity as worth only $.28/Dth and the current shipper is willing to match that rate does that mean he can retain the capacity?  Then for what term, whatever the market bids that piece for or will there be a set time the (in years) that the  holder of the capacity will have to match regardless of what the bidder bids?<br/><br/>I hope this example makes sense.  <mark>If not, please give me a call to discuss at (303) 252-6224.</mark><br/><br/><br/>Thanks for your help.<br/><br/>Terri Dickerson<br/><br/>>>> \"Lokay, Michelle\" <Michelle.Lokay@ENRON.com> 04/17/01 12:09PM >>><br/><br/>Transwestern Pipeline Company Red Rock Expansion<br/><br/><br/>            From October 30, 2000 to November 17, 2000, Transwestern<br/>posted a notice of open season.

dusted off (yes, he is actually camping at the <br/>fairgrounds in LaGrange!).  Now all our fearless leader (and incidentally, <br/>the National Multiple Sclerosis Society's 2000 Man of the Year), Jeff <br/>Skilling, needs is your help in raising money for MS.<br/><br/>Enron's MS150 Dream Team is bigger than some townships in these parts - over <br/>350 Enron employees, led by Jeff, will ride from Houston to Austin under the <br/>Enron Flag April 15-16, and the team's goal is to raise $350,000.  I am <br/>challenging (is begging a better word?) each of you to pledge a certain <br/>amount per mile - i.e., $1, $2, $5, it's your call.  I'll even give you a <br/>break on the calculation and use 150 miles, even though Jeff swears it's <br/>closer to 170 miles (you know how he is with numbers).  Of course, a flat <br/>pledge is also appreciated.  And don't forget, Enron will match your pledge <br/>to this very worthy cause 1-1.<br/><br/>I hope you will join the team and help Enron maintain its status as the top <br/>money raiser of all MS150 rides in the NATION!  Thank you for your <br/>consideration.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call me.<br/><br/>Sherri x3-5984<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n",

IPALCO common stock was=20<br/>suspended from trading at the close of the market on March 27. =20<br/><br/>Analysis: The purchase of IPALCO, an established and respected utility in t=<br/>he=20<br/>Midwest, will help AES to continue to secure its foothold in this region an=<br/>d=20<br/>further the company's aggressive expansion efforts along the generation sid=<br/>e=20<br/>of its business. AES already owns CILCORP, an energy services company whose=<br/>=20<br/>largest subsidiary, CILCO, serves portions of Illinois and Missouri. (Note=<br/>=20<br/>that pursuant to an SEC order, AES will restructure and/or sell its ownersh=<br/>ip=20<br/>interests in CILCORP within two years in order to retain its status as an=<br/>=20<br/>exempt holding company under PUHCA). Thus, through the purchase of IPALCO,=<br/>=20<br/>AES is strengthening a presence in the Midwest that it already has=20<br/>established. In addition, from this purchase we now know that AES, along wi=<br/>th=20<br/>being a global player, intends to remain dominant throughout the United=20<br/>States as well. Further, the acquisition represents a rather bright=20<br/>development for AES, considering that the company has recently encountered=<br/>=20<br/>some ongoing challenges related to its operations in California.=20<br/><br/>First, let's examine the value of AES' acquisition of IPALCO. Certainly, th=<br/>e=20<br/>3,000 MW of generation that AES gained in the deal must have been the prima=<br/>ry=20<br/>draw, but from comments made by Dennis Bakke, AES president and CEO, the=20<br/>company apparently also wants to become a marketing presence in Indiana (an=<br/>d=20<br/>the Midwest as a whole). IPALCO gains in the deal by now being under the=20<br/>aggressive management of AES; the subsidiaries under IPALCO such as=20<br/>Indianapolis Power & Light will now stand a much better chance for global=<br/>=20<br/>development and expansion.=20<br/><br/>As with other generation acquisitions that AES has made, the company secure=<br/>s=20<br/>a decided edge over competitors that may have strong marketing presence but=<br/>=20<br/>fewer hard assets. With its strong generation portfolio, to which the IPALC=<br/>O=20<br/>purchase only adds, AES can further guarantee to potential customers a=20<br/>reliable power supply. AES is one of the largest generation companies in th=<br/>e=20<br/>world, having reached this level through a series of strategic acquisitions=<br/>.=20<br/>The company's generating assets include interests in 134 facilities totalin=<br/>g=20<br/>over 48 gigawatts of capacity. By comparison, Calpine has approximately=20<br/>36,700 MW, Dynegy has a net ownership of 12,497 MW, and Reliant has about=<br/>=20<br/>27,000 MW. In addition, AES' electricity distribution network has over=20<br/>920,000 km of conductor and associated rights of way, and sells over 126,00=<br/>0=20<br/>GWh per year to over 17 million end-user customers. =20<br/><br/>AES has surpassed many of its power supply competitors by maintaining an=20<br/>aggressive growth strategy over the past year. Recent milestones for the=20<br/>company are too many to list here. However, highlights include acquiring a=<br/>=20<br/>controlling interest in Electricidad de Caracas; acquiring 100-percent=20<br/>interest in Tractebel Power; purchasing 70-percent interest in the Mohave=<br/>=20<br/>Generating Station in Laughlin, Nev.; and purchasing GeoUtilities, Inc., an=<br/>=20<br/>Internet-based superstore for energy and telecom services. Just since the=<br/>=20<br/>start of 2001, AES entered into an agreement to purchase all of the energy=<br/>=20<br/>assets of Thermo Ecotec Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Thermo=20<br/>Electron Corporation of Waltham, Mass., for $195 million, and announced new=<br/>=20<br/>generation development projects in Texas and California. AES also has=20<br/>continued its international expansion with an acquisition of a 140-MW=20<br/>oil-fired co-generation facility in Italy, the acquisition of a 290-MW=20<br/>barge-mounted natural-gas fired generating business in Nigeria, and the=20<br/>purchase of additional ownership interest in a 1,000-MW hydro plant in=20<br/>Argentina. =20<br/><br/>As I've said in the past, AES is a company to watch. Even when acquisitions=<br/>=20<br/>that AES is making seem rather small, they must be taken within the context=<br/>=20<br/>of the portfolio that AES is building. Whether it's generation, retail=20<br/>marketing, telecom, or selling electricity over the Internet, AES has a=20<br/>foothold in many different areas. AES is a major player that can offer the=<br/>=20<br/>full package to a customer, which may in the end be its strongest advantage=<br/>.=20<br/>The company maintains that it is engaged in three lines of businesses, whic=<br/>h=20<br/>are all equally important to its strategy: power generation, network delive=<br/>ry=20<br/>services and retail energy marketing. However, it is important to recognize=<br/>=20<br/>that AES continues to build a huge generation arsenal and now has the=20<br/>capability to market its commodity products through its marketing=20<br/>subsidiaries.=20<br/><br/>However, although AES has had a fairly successful year, the company has hit=<br/>=20<br/>some bumps and made some questionable decisions along the way, all of which=<br/>=20<br/>were related to the California market. AES has established several tolling=<br/>=20<br/>agreements with Williams Corp. for the power plants that AES owns in=20<br/>California. Under the tolling agreements, AES essentially rents its plants =<br/>to=20<br/>Williams so that Williams can generate fuel to electricity, which it then c=<br/>an=20<br/>sell on the wholesale market. In other words, Williams had a contract to=20<br/>market all of the power generated by AES' California plants. In hindsight,=<br/>=20<br/>AES may regret the questionable decision to enter into the tolling agreemen=<br/>ts=20<br/>with Williams in California. Although AES did well last year, with net inco=<br/>me=20<br/>rising 181 percent to $641 million, the company reportedly lost $11 million=<br/>=20<br/>on the lucrative California market. Meanwhile, Williams (NYSE: WMB) reporte=<br/>d=20<br/>unaudited 2000 income from continuing operations of $873.2 million, or $1.9=<br/>5=20<br/>per share on a diluted basis, versus $178 million, or 40 cents per share on=<br/> a=20<br/>restated basis, for 1999. AES also took a hit when it had to pay air=20<br/>pollution fines and buy power on the wholesale market to meet its obligatio=<br/>ns=20<br/>to Williams when it was forced to shut some plants down. =20<br/><br/>Further, AES (along with other companies) continues to fall under the inten=<br/>se=20<br/>scrutiny of FERC for pricing that the commission has deemed \"unjust and=20<br/>unreasonable\" for power generated at AES-owned plants. FERC's investigation=<br/>=20<br/>centers on the unavailability of certain so-called \"must run\" generating=20<br/>plants in the Los Angeles area that are owned by AES Southland, a subsidiar=<br/>y=20<br/>of AES. A \"must run\" plant is a generating facility that the California ISO=<br/>=20<br/>can call upon to provide energy and ancillary service essential to the=20<br/>reliability of the California transmission network. Several weeks ago, FERC=<br/>=20<br/>announced that a preliminary investigation raised serious questions about t=<br/>he=20<br/>actions of Williams Energy Marketing and Trading and AES.  =20<br/><br/>On March 14, FERC gave the two companies 20 days to explain why they should=<br/>=20<br/>not refund $10.86 million to California utilities. Further, FERC said that=<br/>=20<br/>\"Williams had a financial incentive to prolong any outages\" of two AES-owne=<br/>d=20<br/>plants last April and May. \"Williams received more revenues as a result of=<br/>=20<br/>the respective outages,\" the commission said. AES responded to the charges =<br/>by=20<br/>saying that the plants were taken off line for repairs and that it did not=<br/>=20<br/>share in market revenues from sales of power from the plants. According to =<br/>a=20<br/>report in The Washington Post, AES Pacific Group vice president Stu Ryan sa=<br/>id=20<br/>that as long as the plants are in operating condition, Williams decides whe=<br/>n=20<br/>they will run and what it will charge for their power. =20<br/><br/>As a result of the unavailability of the two \"must run\" AES plants, the=20<br/>state's ISO had to obtain power from other plants, also owned by AES, where=<br/>=20<br/>the power was much more expensive and the companies made much larger=20<br/>profits.  The commission said its investigation indicated that AES and=20<br/>Williams refused to make the two \"must run\" plants available \"for reasons=<br/>=20<br/>that were not directly related to the necessary and timely maintenance\" of=<br/>=20<br/>the plant. =20<br/><br/>Many power supply companies that were active in the California wholesale=20<br/>market now are retreating due to the volatility and uncertainty of the=20<br/>state's market. Although it remains unclear how AES will continue to=20<br/>participate in the California market, it may be a smart move for the compan=<br/>y=20<br/>to focus on expanding operations in other regions of the United States (suc=<br/>h=20<br/>as the Midwest). Yet, how AES' acquisition of IPALCO will impact the=20<br/>company's bottom line remains to be seen. Standard & Poor's (S&P) is=20<br/>reserving its assessment of the partnership for the time being, and is=20<br/>keeping AES on CreditWatch. AES' double-'B' corporate credit, single-'B'-pl=<br/>us=20<br/>rating on subordinated debt, and single-'B' rating on the company's trust=<br/>=20<br/>preferred securities remain intact pending further review and information=<br/>=20<br/>about the acquisition of IPALCO. Also, S=02?lowered its corporate credit ra=<br/>tings=20<br/>on IPALCO to triple-'B' from single-'A'-plus, and IPALCO's subsidiary,=20<br/>Indianapolis Power & Light Co. (IPL), to triple-'B' from double-'A'-minus,=<br/>=20<br/>and revised the CreditWatch implications to positive from negative. S=02?ex=<br/>pects=20<br/>to address the CreditWatch status in the next two weeks. =20<br/><br/>On March 27, AES shares closed at about $47.75. As of mid-morning on March=<br/>=20<br/>28, AES shares were priced at about $50.00. Over the last few days, AES=20<br/>shares have increased by about 5 percent and have closely tracked the Dow=<br/>=20<br/>Jones Utility Average.=20<br/><br/>An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at<br/>www.ConsultRCI.com<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Reach thousands of utility analysts and decision makers every day.

Upon receipt we noticed that it was not a Cost<br/>Plus Contract.  Therefore, we spoke with him about this matter.  He<br/>indicated that although he believes he will be doing the home on a cost plus<br/>basis, no final agreement regarding this matter had yet been made.<br/><br/>The Residential Construction Contract form he uses is a Greater Houston<br/>Builders Association form which is, for the most part, a good one although<br/>it is written primarily to protect the builder.  Therefore, we may ask that<br/>a number of minor changes be made to the Contract as it relates to notice<br/>requirements to you regarding problems in construction and some changes in<br/>the indemnity language.  In addition, there may be some other changes we<br/>request.  Under any circumstance, we can dictate a letter to Mr. Kent at the<br/>appropriate time.<br/><br/>Mr. Kent also indicated that he will make sure we receive a copy of the Deed<br/>Restrictions as soon as possible.<br/><br/>We assume that you will acquire financing for the construction of the home<br/>itself.  When you close, Flair Construction Co., Inc. will also have to<br/>provide to you a Disclosure Statement which spells out some of your rights<br/>and responsibilities under Texas law and a Contractors List of<br/>Subcontractors and Suppliers which tells you the names and addresses of the<br/>Subcontractors Flair intends on using.  We are sure that the construction<br/>lender will require that these documents be provided at the appropriate<br/>time.<br/><br/>Should you have any questions or comments, please call us.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n",

(I replied and told them to correct the address.)  Let me know<br/>if this is OK.  I don't know if  we can find a cheaper place, but if you<br/>think this rate is too high I can try.  Also, I made reservations to go to<br/>Burbank on Dec. 31 using Southwest Airlines and leaving from Oakland at<br/>10:40 am, arriving at 11:40.  Returning on Jan. 1 at 8:15 pm and arriving at<br/>9:20.  However, I learned from Cameron that all but your mother and I will<br/>be going on Dec. 30 so I  will cancel that part of the reservation.  I don't<br/>know  what your plans are for returning so I will not be making any  other<br/>reservations unless I hear from you.  I originally made the returning<br/>reservation at the time I did so that if we came back to the house on Monday<br/>to watch football games and  play games we would have some time to do that.<br/>If we don't do that we could possibly get an earlier flight back.  Your<br/>mother doesn't want to come  back too late, so your mother and I couldn't<br/>possibly watch a movie if Hef has one planned for later, but you might<br/>consider that possibility.  Our check-in time at the W is 3:00 pm,  possibly<br/>earlier.  I assume you got my message left on the answering  machine that<br/>everyone  has been invited to the party.<br/><br/><br/> -----Original Message-----<br/>From:    whotels@whotels.com [mailto:whotels@whotels.com]<br/>Sent:   Wednesday, December 20, 2000 6:08 PM<br/>To:   ELDON@interx.net<br/>Subject:   Reservation Confirmation<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n",

      "Roberta Sheaffer<br/>891 Ashworth Lane<br/>Boalsburg, PA 16827<br/>beauhan@worldnet.att.net<br/><br/>To Mr. Ken Lay,<br/><br/>I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.<br/><br/>Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.<br/><br/>The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  <mark>Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.</mark><br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Roberta Sheaffer\n",

I finally<br/>have reviewed them and have a couple comments.<br/><br/>The only proposed changes that need explanation are in paragraphs 1 and 3 of<br/>each agreement.  Paragraphs 1 and 3 are typical provisions in a<br/>confidentiality agreement where each side is evaluating a transaction.<br/>However, the confidential information disclosed under these particular<br/>agreements is going to be used not only for trading activities but also in<br/>connection with audit rights related to an existing and ongoing contractual<br/>relationship.  The confidentiality agreements should not affect enovate's<br/>and PMW's rights under the LLC Agreement.  Accordingly, the proposed changes<br/>are my attempt to clarify the usual text.<br/><br/>Please call if you wish to discuss.  I believe my procrastination has<br/>resulted in the business people wanting to sign these up next week, so your<br/>attention to this is appreciated.  Thanks.<br/><br/> <<Conf Ag enovate L.L.C.

      "Maureen McGee<br/>790 Alma Real Drive<br/>Pacific Palisades, CA 90272<br/>milder.mcgee@verizon.net<br/><br/>To Mr. Ken Lay,<br/><br/>I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.<br/><br/>Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.<br/><br/>The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  <mark>Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.</mark><br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Maureen McGee\n",

      "Lisa Cohen<br/>139 Sixth Ave<br/>Brooklyn, NY 11217<br/>MsYentah@aol.com<br/><br/>To Mr. Ken Lay,<br/><br/>I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.<br/><br/>Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.<br/><br/>The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  <mark>Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.</mark><br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Lisa Cohen\n",

Since we invoice Akzo manually I am <br/>trying to reconcile the system with what we have invoice Akzo.<br/>The way we are invoicing them is that we assume that they take the 1125 mmbtu <br/>daily.  However, there is one or two days of each month(almost) that they <br/>take less than the 1125/day.  That changes the numbers.  As it looks I may <br/>have to go back and do PMA invoices to invoice them balance.  I wanted to <br/>speak with you on this before I actually do anything.  Here is an example:<br/><br/>August manual invoice:<br/>34,875 @ 2.6676 =  $93,032.55<br/>24,520 @ 4.4775 =  $109,790.09<br/>Total        $202,822.64<br/><br/><br/>System Invoice:<br/>34,633  @  2.6676  = $92,386.99<br/>24,762  @   4.4775=   $110,871.86<br/>Total          $203,258.85<br/><br/>Difference         $436.21<br/>The reason to the difference in volume is that on 8/8 only 883 mmtu flowed. <br/><br/>The balance is not a big one but it is over my limit to overwrite. <br/>My questions is do you want me to go back and send Akzo PMA invoices???<br/>Give me a call if you need to speak to me about this.<br/>thanks<br/>isabel<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n",

      "Greg Maloney<br/>318 Lexington Ave.<br/>Pitman, NJ 08071<br/>GPMaloney@yahoo.com<br/><br/>To Mr. Ken Lay,<br/><br/>I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.<br/><br/>Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.<br/><br/>The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  <mark>Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.</mark><br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Greg Maloney\n",

Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.<br/><br/>Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.<br/><br/>The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  <mark>Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.</mark><br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Charlene Inglis\n",

I will have a schedule that <br/>details your 2000 plan, 2000 estimate based on the first 6 months of 2000 and <br/>a template for the 2001 plan.  <br/><br/>I will be mostly interested in getting the following information from you <br/>tomorrow:<br/><br/>1) Are you expecting an increase in headcount?  If so, what level of person?<br/>2) What percentage increase in salaries for 2001?<br/>3) Will you increase the # of analyst and associates used in this cost center?<br/>4) What special pays, sign on bonuses, employee agreement, etc. do you want <br/>to plan for?<br/>5) Are you expecting any promotions?<br/>6) If you increase headcount, would this person(s) come from placement <br/>agencies?  Would we need to plan relocation costs for them?<br/>7) Do you expect to use any consulting firms or outside temporaries?<br/>8) Will you have any employee offsites or customer meetings that we should <br/>plan for?  If so, how much and where?<br/>9) Will you have any large capital expenditures other than computers, <br/>monitors and software?<br/>10) Do you anticipate any other changes in this cost center that we should <br/>plan for (ie, opening of another office, etc.)<br/><br/>My last day in this group is Thursday so I was trying to get this finished <br/>before Paula Harris took over.

This op-ed titled - Business<br/>As the Target - highlights the attacks the business community is<br/>under from anti-business candidates.  I also feel it underscores the<br/>importance of helping to elect and voting for pro-business<br/>candidates!<br/><br/>To read Mr. Donohue's op-ed, please click here -<br/>http://www.uschamber.com/Elections/_Business+as+the+Target.htm<br/><br/>Or, to help elect pro-business candidates, please:<br/><br/>1.

The question still to be answered is when=<br/> the arctic air arrives.  The current cool down in the East is very transit=<br/>ional with warmer air to return by the end of the week. The pattern has cle=<br/>arly changed as the jet stream has been suppressed Southward. In the short =<br/>(and medium) terms, things should turn stormier, but not neccessarily colde=<br/>r. In fact, latest charts indicate a healthy ridge to build late this perio=<br/>d over the SE U.S. in response to a trough developing over the Rockies.

It has been slow in developing a=<br/>nd the cool down now in the East would hardly be considered significant unl=<br/>ess it is compared to the record warmth of the last couple of weeks. The pa=<br/>ttern I foresee going into early December is colder relative to normal in t=<br/>he West and warmer in the East. Specifically a storm track from the SW into=<br/> the Plains and NE will set up allowing for generous rain (with snow North)=<br/> to develop. Arctic air is moving to this side of the pole and pooling in N=<br/>W Canada. Now, a mechanism to drive it SE is needed. One of the tools used =<br/>that I occasionally refer to is the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).  Most=<br/> winter forecasts have predicted this as largely negative this se! ason whi=<br/>ch is a robust signal for cold air in the East. It has been negative the la=<br/>st two weeks though in fairness its reliability as a signal gets much highe=<br/>r in December for cold. I find it interesting to note the signal is expecte=<br/>d to go weakly positive next week. Bottom line for the period is I see a co=<br/>ntinuation of a cold bias with the Western trough and a warm bias in the vi=<br/>cinity of the Eastern ridge. We may also see a significant storm move throu=<br/>gh the country during the period, but again I look for snow to be confined =<br/>to the North.

This draft  <br/>would requires some modifications so as to refer to the \"Joint Parties\" as  <br/>opposed to solely mentioning AReM, and I might? add a section dealing more  <br/>explicitly with WPTF's contribution to getting the zero minimum bill <br/>stipulation  signed in the first place.? Otherwise, the document would stay <br/>much as it  is (subject to your input over the next few days, of course).? <br/>Please let  me know what you think asap, as I am already working on a WPTF <br/>draft.?  Incidentally, I will also be filing comments on behalf of ABAG which <br/>will  support the positions taken in the attached document, but I am not <br/>proposing  that ABAG also be a party to this filing.? Thanks for your help!?  <br/>Comments as soon as possible would be very much appreciated!<br/>?<br/>Dan<br/>?<br/>?<br/>Law Offices of Daniel W. Douglass<br/>5959 Topanga Canyon Blvd.?

From:  V Charles Weldon                           05/01/2001 03:02 PM <br/>  <br/><br/><br/>To: David Fairley/Enron@EnronXGate, Mathew Gimble/HOU/ECT@ECT, Edith Cross/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jennifer Bagwell/Enron@EnronXGate, Ruth Concannon/HOU/ECT@ECT<br/>cc: Eric Boyt/Corp/Enron@Enron, Ed McMichael/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Breese/HOU/ECT@ECT, V Charles Weldon/HOU/ECT@ECT <br/>Subject: Ft. Pierce Gas Capacity Assumptions<br/><br/>The following basic assumptions concerning gas capacity requirements for the Fort Pierce project were confirmed today at a meeting attended by Dave Fairley, Ed McMichael, Ruth Concannon, Mark Breese, Eric Boyt, and Charlie Weldon.   (NOTE:  The heat rates and MW are subject to change pending final engineering evaluation.  The intent of this note is to document the overall runtime assumptions.)<br/><br/>1) During the summertime months of May through September, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where  Enron's 200 MW are dispatched as are Ft. Pierce's 82MW.<br/><br/>2)  Enron will purchase summertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 200 MW for 16 hours per day at our \"bought-down\" heat rate of 6690.  This equals 22,300 MMBTU/day and will allow for taking the full daily capacity in only a 16 hour period (6% per hour)  The table below summarizes the monthly capacity requirements:<br/><br/><br/><br/>   MONTH Total Capacity Needed By Enron Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU) Phase VI Capacity  Capacity From East Desk <br/>May 22,300 0 22,300 0 <br/>June 22,300 0 22,300 0 <br/>July 22,300 0 22,300 0 <br/>August 22,300 0 22,300 0 <br/>September 22,300 0 22,300 0 <br/><br/><br/>  NTOE:  Prior to Phase VI completion, the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.<br/><br/>3)  Ft. Pierce will use its existing FT via FGU to secure its gas requirements at the 9500 contractual heat rate for the 16 hours it is dispatched in the summer.<br/><br/>4)  For the winter months of October through April, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where Ft. Pierce is not dispatched, thus leaving Enron with 282MW at the overall plant heat rate of 7500.  This equates to 35,251 MMBTU/day and allows for taking the full capacity in only 16 hours (6% per hour)<br/><br/>5)  Because Ft. Pierce will not be dispatched during the winter, their unused capacity via FGU will be available for Enron.  These amounts differ by month as summarized in the table below.<br/><br/>6) Enron will purchase wintertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 282 MW for 16 hours per day at a 7500 heat rate, less the monthly capacities available from Ft. Pierce via FGU.  These non-FGU purchased quantities will come from the Phase VI capacity and the East Desk as shown below:<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>   MONTH Total Capacity Needed By Enron Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU) Phase VI Capacity (Nov-Mar = 28% of Summer) Capacity From East Desk <br/>October 35,251 14,665 22,300 0 <br/>November 35,251 14,595 6,244 14,412 <br/>December 35,251 14,895 6,244 14,112 <br/>January 35,251 16,547 6,244 12,460 <br/>February 35,251 15,317 6,244 13,690 <br/>March 35,251 15,317 6,244 13,690 <br/>April 35,251 15,317 22,300 0 <br/><br/><br/>NOTE:  Prior to Phase VI completion , the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.<br/><br/>7)  Backup documentation supporting the hourly gas requirement in each dispatch mode is attached to this memo.<br/><br/> <br/>\n",

Note that they have recommended that a<br/>few of the more specific details regarding the corresponding Enron usage of<br/>the RMS weather model be addressed in a simple but separate license<br/>agreement.   As discussed, in addition to general confidentialiy<br/>provisions, those terms will include (1) the access will not cover any<br/>international weather data that may be added to the system during the term<br/>of use through December 31, as our costs associated with such data are<br/>uncertain and (2) the use of the model will be for Enron internal purposes<br/>only with no data or analysis results to be shared with third parties.<br/><br/>I would appreciate if you can forward this to your legal dept. to review so<br/>that we can hopefully get this resolved quickly.<br/><br/>Thanks/regards<br/><br/>Paul<br/><br/>(See attached file: EnronTransferAgmt.DOC)<br/> - EnronTransferAgmt.DOC<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n",

Is this GTC <br/>only intended to be used between Enron Japan Corp. and a Japanese <br/>counterparty?  The GTCs have been tailored for Japanese counterparties.<br/><br/>With respect to footnote number 1 you are correct the issue is covered under <br/>4(f).  Noted. With respect to footnote number 2 unless one of the parties to <br/>a transaction is a US counterparty or there is a local law requirement I am <br/>not sure we need representation 5 (b).  We obtain essentially the same <br/>representation from the counterparty under representation 5 (d). Noted and <br/>agreed.<br/><br/>I would recommend reinserting the paragraph entitled \"Early Termination\" that <br/>you have deleted.  Enron prefers to have \"Loss\" apply for valuations upon <br/>early termination, especially in situations where there is not a liquid <br/>market or for unusual or longdated trades.  I think the weather market is one <br/>where Enron would prefer to use the \"Loss\" method of calculation.   See 4. <br/>(a) and (b) and inform me if this is sufficient.<br/><br/>I would also reinsert the designation that Enron is the Calculation Agent <br/>(unless there is a good reason to not designate a Calculation Agent).  See 4. <br/>(d) and inform me if this is sufficient.<br/><br/>I assume that the payee tax representations are not applicable because there <br/>is no withholding (for either residents or nonresidents of Japan) on <br/>derivative transactions.  Please let me know if this is not the case.  I have <br/>copied Susan Musch on this correspondence to receive her input regarding tax <br/>issues.<br/><br/>Please let me know if you have any questions regarding my comments.<br/><br/>Brent<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n",

      "Enron recently introduced its Global Information System (GIS) as the first of <br/>a series of activities designed to enhance and improve the accuracy and <br/>accessibility of employee data. 4,578 employees responded and provided <br/>up-to-date information on themselves.  This represents a response of <br/>approximately 55% of the employees asked to participate. <br/><br/> Accurate data will play an important role in several key company-wide <br/>initiatives in the coming months, such as the SAP implementation and an <br/>expert directory, which will include a new on-line phone directory and <br/>employee skills.<br/><br/>The GIS provides you a vehicle to use in updating your personal information <br/>including your phone extension, office location, home address, current job <br/>responsibilities, as well as, existing skills and educational background.   <br/>You are the best source of accurate information about you!  <br/><br/>Since you have not yet updated your information, I urge you to do so today.  <br/>The GIS system will be available for your use through Friday, March 31.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You can access GIS from the Enron Intranet in one of two ways:<br/>1. from the Enron Home page (home.enron.com)<br/>2. from the HRWeb Home page (hrweb.enron.com)<br/>Look for the link to GIS in the \"New\" section of either page.<br/><br/>As a first time user, please click on the \"New User\" button to enter your ID <br/>and set your password.

      "Eric and I can type up a couple of possible itineraries this weekend, based<br/>upon some initial research. It'll include potential routes and possible<br/>sights to see along the way. I think we can basically decide as we go. We<br/>are also having dinner with someone Eric works with this Friday who has<br/>been to Spain recently with his family. They went down to the Andulusian<br/>White Hill towns near Seville. As you know, Eric and I were only in and<br/>around Madrid, so we'll pick this guy's brain. I agree about packing light.<br/>It sounds like we'll need a few sweaters though. I think it'll be between<br/>50-60 during the day. I don't know if they have heat in Spain yet, so we<br/>may get cold at night. I'm pretty confident we could find a laundry mat if<br/>necessary. I don't want you to stink either, especially if you blow your<br/>butt out like in Minneapolis! Nasty!!! <mark>Please bring your adapter.</mark> I blow<br/>dry my hair in the mornings. Gerald will need to borrow it too in order to<br/>dry his pomp. Eric and I felt that it would be easier to make our hotel<br/>reservations once we get there. On day one, we arrive in the morning. Thus,<br/>we'll have plenty of time to check out a couple of pre-determined hotel<br/>options, especially since we're not in high season.

There is nothing more important to ENA than <br/>attracting and retaining the most talanted and innovative people.<br/><br/>Effectively immediately, written and oral feedback for commercial managers <br/>and directors can be delivered. As per our discussion, the PRC process is <br/>primarily a feedback, performance management and staff planning tool.  It <br/>provides a data point for bonus purposes; however, it is not the only <br/>determinant.  In the interest of ensuring the most effective performance <br/>management tool, I would suggest that we implement the following:<br/> a)For employees ranked in the strong and above categories, the ultimate <br/>ranking should not be communicated and the message should focus on progress <br/>towards identified commercial goals and objectives and progress towards the <br/>further development of desirable leadership and commerical capabilities. <br/>Written and oral feedback should be delivered immediately;<br/> b) For employees ranked in the satisfactory, needs improvement and issues <br/>category, the ultimate ranking should be communicated to ensure approriate <br/>documentation of performance and to stimulate a plan to rectify or cure <br/>performance issues.  For the satisfactory category, the message should focus <br/>on increasing deal-flow, financial performance and productivity.  The bar is <br/>always being raised.  For the needs improvement category, the message should <br/>focus on turning around poor performance over the next six months.  For the <br/>issues category, the business unit manager should determine, in conjunction <br/>with your HR rep., the appropriate plan to find a better \"fit\" in the <br/>organization or counsel out.  Regardless, the ENA Office of the Chairman will <br/>require a written plan of action for all employees in the needs improvement <br/>and issues category from the business unit manager documenting the plan of <br/>action to rectify performance.<br/><br/>Vice President ranking can not be communicated until after the Enron VP PRC <br/>currently scheduled for July 31st.  I anticipate a similar process as above <br/>with our officer feedback process.  Associate and Analyst rankings can not be <br/>communicated until after the Enron A&A PRC currently scheduled for July 19th.<br/><br/>Other identified action items from the meetings include:<br/> a) the HR group will put together a \"profile and performance book\" for ENA's <br/>A&A's to ensure our representatives can augment performance information at <br/>the July 19th meeting;<br/> b) ENA will be aggressively attempting to retain highest performing A&A's to <br/>continue rotating within ENA;<br/> c) ENA will be holding an additional \"off-cycle\" A&A super-saturday for <br/>Houston and Portland in August to augment our capabilities in this area;<br/> and d) your HR representative is building a pipeline of outside employment <br/>candidates for your review each week.  Please review these resumes in a <br/>timely basis and let them know your interest or lack thereof.<br/><br/>Please communicate to your organization as appropriate.<br/><br/>Regards<br/>Mark and Dave<br/>\n",

In doing this, we have tried to keep <br/>the tariff formula as simple as possible, while simulating the PPA tariffs to <br/>the extent possible. (Currently, we have just shown the tariff computation; <br/>will put the tariff formula in the next mail)<br/><br/>The tariff structure & the issue list obviously need further refinement, <br/>before we discuss it with MSEB.<br/><br/>Looking forward to your comments on both the issue list as well as the tariff <br/>computation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>regards,<br/><br/>Rajesh S<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n",

So we have to preapre an <br/>authorized traders list for Enron Credit Inc.  <mark>Please call Richard Sage to</mark> <br/>find out if there are particular names we should use for the various officers <br/>or whether they are simply the same as for ENA.

Please have Richard Sage or the appropriate contact person for the tax ID <br/>number, address number and Classification (corporation, partnership, limited <br/>liability co.) for Enron Credit Inc.

Section 5. --  I am not aware of any restrictions on the ability of a <br/>non-Mexican entity to offer financial derivatives to Mexican counterparties <br/>where such countparties are \"vetted\" before trading commences.  It seems <br/>that, for so long as derivatives are not offered to the public at-large, then <br/>such an offerings can be made.<br/><br/>2.  Section 9(c) -- A withholding tax, as well as value-added tax, will apply <br/>to payments made by a Mexican counterparty to a non-Mexican entity pursuant <br/>to certain financial derivative transactions.  In addition, a non-Mexican <br/>entity making payment to a Mexican counterparty will be required to pay <br/>Mexican value-added tax pursuant to those certain transactions.  (Please <br/>refer to the e-mail that I sent yesterday, which indicates that payments <br/>pursuant to those 16 financial derivative transaction descriptions provided <br/>to me by Jaime Williams will not be subject to any Mexican withholding or VAT <br/>tax since they fall outside of the regime that would otherwise subject such <br/>payments to Mexican tax.)  I have been working extensively with Mexican tax <br/>counsel on these issues, so please consider Rich, Heather y Mueller's \"No\" <br/>response as relevant only to a tax applicable to transactions conducted <br/>through the internet (and not with respect to the underlying transaction).<br/><br/><mark>Please call me at ext. 35777 with any questions.</mark><br/><br/>Best regards.<br/><br/><br/><br/>   Carol St Clair                07/11/2000 09:53 AM<br/><br/>To: Jeff Blumenthal/HOU/ECT@ECT<br/>cc:  <br/>Subject: questionnaire on Internet trading on commodities.DOC<br/><br/>Jeff:<br/>FYI.

He was being <br/>quite negative about the WGA Feb 2 meeting in Portland, basically saying that <br/>his predecessor had committed to some positions that he was not in agreement <br/>with, and that he didn't think he wanted to participate.  I promised him that <br/>either you or I would call him after our Governor meetings this week to give <br/>him our sense of where the positions/players were going to shake out.  My <br/>initial thought was that we would want him there as a good voice on our side, <br/>but my second thought is that there might be a better strategy play not <br/>having FERC there.

But signals are still mixed -- and economists are waiting to see<br/>how strong retail sales are during the all-important holiday season. I<br/>continue to be optimistic about next year's economy. And the overall market<br/>is behaving as though the upturn isn't far off. But we had a false start in<br/>May and June, and there's still no way of being sure that a sustainable<br/>recovery is about to take hold.<br/><br/>The good news amid all this uncertainty is that many stocks have lagged the<br/>recent market pickup -- and they're still selling at extraordinarily low<br/>prices. Sanford C. Bernstein's Strategic Value fund includes a lot of these<br/>bargain-priced issues, which Bernstein calls \"deep-value stocks.\" Here's a<br/>quick look at five stocks that Bernstein has favored this year.<br/><br/>American Electric Power<br/>One of the nation's lowest-cost electricity producers, AEP [AEP] serves<br/>nearly 5 million customers in the middle of the country, from Ohio to<br/>Louisiana. The company is considering a plan to divide regulated and<br/>non-regulated businesses, which could boost the total value of the stock.<br/>Earnings growth is projected at 7 percent annually over the next five<br/>years, and the shares yield 5.7 percent, high even for a utility. At<br/>$42.40, the stock trades at just over 11 times next year's estimated earnings.<br/><br/>Dow Chemical<br/>Now the largest chemical company by revenues (ahead of DuPont), Dow's [DOW]<br/>basic chemical businesses are in the midst of a cyclical earnings decline,<br/>compounded by dilution following February's acquisition of Union Carbide.<br/>Profits should start rebounding in the second half of next year, helped by<br/>an improving economy and post-merger cost cutting. Earnings could grow 9<br/>percent annually over the next five years, and the yield is 3.5 percent. At<br/>$38, the stock trades at 27 times next year's earnings.<br/><br/>Occidental Petroleum<br/>One of the most profitable oil companies on a per-barrel basis, Oxy's [OXY]<br/>earnings have been held back by its chemical operations. Results will be<br/>depressed next year, but should rebound in 2003. The stock is a likely<br/>takeover candidate if the industry consolidates. Earnings could grow 9<br/>percent annually over the next five years, and the yield is 4 percent. At<br/>$24.90, the stock trades at 12.5 times next year's earnings.<br/><br/>Sears<br/>Still one of the largest U.S. retailers, Sears [S] is No.1 in appliances.<br/>The company has emphasized energy-efficient models, which are popular<br/>because of consumers' concerns about high oil and gas prices. Earnings<br/>could grow 9 percent annually over the next five years, and the yield is 2<br/>percent. At $45.10, the stock trades at less than 11 times next year's<br/>earnings.<br/><br/>Washington Mutual<br/>The nation's largest thrift with offices in 42 states, Washington Mutual<br/>[WM] has traditionally been strong in adjustable-rate mortgages. Those ARMs<br/>have recently lost share to fixed-rate loans because long-term interest<br/>rates have been so low. As a result, the share price is now undervalued<br/>relative to other financial companies. Earnings could grow percent 13<br/>annually over the next five years, and the yield is 2.9 percent. At $33.10,<br/>the stock trades at nine times next year's earnings.<br/><br/>###<br/><br/>Read all of Michael's columns at:<br/>http://money.cnn.com/markets/sivy/<br/><br/>To subscribe or unsubscribe to Sivy on Stocks, go to:<br/>http://money.cnn.com/email/<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------<br/>DEVELOP CONFIDENCE TO MAKE MONEY IN ANY MARKET WITH THE MONEY'S<br/>COACHING FOR INVESTORS program!<br/>Tap the expertise of MONEY and gain control over your finances with<br/>the help of a one-on-one coach.

      "Hey Guys. <br/><br/>We have a new strategy taking power from the south to the north. Right now Sierra Pacific will only let us schedule 12MW on the tie so do not try to schedule any more (The tie is only good for 17MW).<br/><br/>- Either do a export from SP15 to Silverpeak or put in a wheel going out at Silverpeak(From PV or FC).<br/>- Buy transmission from SPP from  (www.swoasis.com ) CONTROL TO HILLTOP. ($6.90 on-peak, $3.90 off-peak)<br/>- Buy transmission from PAC from MAL2 TO MAL5. ($5.84)<br/>- Buy transmission from BPA from HILLTOP TO SNOHO or another Sink. (Account numbers below).<br/><br/>We need to bounce this of SNOHO before we send it back in at Malin. <br/><br/>THIS SCHEDULE NEEDS TO BE TAGGED OR SIERRA PACIFIC GETS VERY PISSED OFF, THEY ARE NOT USED TO DOING TO MUCH REAL TIME. THERE IS A TEMPLATE FOR THIS SCHEDULE SO IT SHOULD NOT BE HARD. <mark>Call and confirm the request with both PAC and Sierra.</mark><br/><br/><br/><br/>Also do not sell to a marketer(especially POWEREX) without sleeving. We do not want anybody else to know about the path. If Powerex sees this I guarantee that they would try to schedule this and we do not want competition. Right now the only person using the tie is SOCAL EDISON and they are flowing 12MW into Cali, going the opposite way of us way.  <br/><br/>It is available 24hrs a day so lets take advantage of it as much as we can.<br/>If you have any questions over the weekend call me.<br/><br/>Account numbers:<br/>SPP - PAC: 853724<br/>SPP-SNOHO: 853703<br/>SPP-PUGET: 853725<br/><br/><br/>Geir\n",

Litigation and Other Contingencies<br/><br/>Litigation<br/>=09Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items=<br/> of which are discussed below.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron =<br/>believes, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate=<br/> reserves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such =<br/>items, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse i=<br/>mpact on Enron's financial position or results of operations.<br/><br/>=09In 1995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in Harris County Di=<br/>strict Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company (Intratex), Ho=<br/>uston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company (collectively, the Enron =<br/>Defendants), each of which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron.  The Plai=<br/>ntiffs were either sellers or royalty owners under numerous gas purchase co=<br/>ntracts with Intratex, many of which have terminated.  Early in 1996, the c=<br/>ase was severed by the Court into two matters to be tried (or otherwise res=<br/>olved) separately.  In the first matter, the Plaintiffs alleged that the En=<br/>ron Defendants committed fraud and negligent misrepresentation in connectio=<br/>n with the \"Panhandle program,\" a special marketing program established in =<br/>the early 1980s.  This case was tried in October 1996 and resulted in a ver=<br/>dict for the Enron Defendants.  In the second matter, the Plaintiffs allege=<br/> that the Enron Defendants violated state regulatory requirements and certa=<br/>in gas purchase contracts by failing to take the Plaintiffs' gas ratably wi=<br/>th other producers' gas at certain times between 1978 and 1988.  The trial =<br/>court certified a class action with respect to ratability claims.  On March=<br/> 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the trial court's class certif=<br/>ication was improper and remanded the case to the trial court.  The Enron D=<br/>efendants deny the Plaintiffs' claims and have asserted various affirmative=<br/> defenses, including the statute of limitations.  The Enron Defendants beli=<br/>eve that they have strong legal and factual defenses, and intend to vigorou=<br/>sly contest the claims.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron believe=<br/>s that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material ad=<br/>verse effect on its financial position or results of operations.<br/><br/>=09On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in the Humberto Vidal Buildi=<br/>ng in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The explosion resulted in fatalities, bodily =<br/>injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property.  San Juan Gas=<br/> Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, operated a propane/air d=<br/>istribution system in the vicinity, but did not provide service to the buil=<br/>ding. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and their insurance carriers wer=<br/>e named as defendants, along with several third parties, including The Puer=<br/>to Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, Puerto Rico Telephone Company, Heath =<br/>Consultants Incorporated, Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their insurance carriers=<br/>, in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Pue=<br/>rto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico.  These suits seek damages f=<br/>or wrongful death, personal injury, business interruption and property dama=<br/>ge allegedly caused by the explosion.  After nearly four years without dete=<br/>rmining the cause of the explosion, all parties agreed not to litigate furt=<br/>her that issue, but to move these suits toward settlements or trials to det=<br/>ermine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the explosion and,=<br/> if so, the lawful damages attributable to such injury. The defendants agre=<br/>ed on a fund for settlements or final awards. Numerous claims have been set=<br/>tled and ten cases involving 19 plaintiffs are scheduled for trial in the U=<br/>nited States District Court beginning on December 10, 2001.  No cases have =<br/>yet been scheduled for trial in the Superior Court.  Although no assurances=<br/> can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters=<br/> will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or resul=<br/>ts of operations.<br/><br/>=09Trojan Investment Recovery.  In early 1993, Portland General Electric (P=<br/>GE) ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power generating faci=<br/>lity.  The Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) granted PGE, through a g=<br/>eneral rate order, recovery of, and a return on, 87 percent of its remainin=<br/>g investment in Trojan.=20<br/><br/>=09The OPUC's general rate order related to Trojan has been subject to liti=<br/>gation in various state courts, including rulings by the Oregon Court of Ap=<br/>peals and petitions to the Oregon Supreme Court filed by parties opposed to=<br/> the OPUC's order, including the Utility Reform Project(URP) and the Citize=<br/>ns Utility Board (CUB).<br/><br/>=09In August 2000, PGE entered into agreements with the CUB and the staff o=<br/>f the OPUC to settle the litigation related to PGE's recovery of its invest=<br/>ment in the Trojan plant.  Under the agreements, the CUB agreed to withdraw=<br/> from the litigation and to support the settlement as the means to resolve =<br/>the Trojan litigation.  The OPUC approved the accounting and ratemaking ele=<br/>ments of the settlement on September 29, 2000.  As a result of these approv=<br/>als, PGE's investment in Trojan is no longer included in rates charged to c=<br/>ustomers, either through a return on or a return of that investment.  Colle=<br/>ction of ongoing decommissioning costs at Trojan is not affected by the set=<br/>tlement agreements or the September 29, 2000 OPUC order.  With the CUB's wi=<br/>thdrawal, the URP is the one remaining significant adverse party in the lit=<br/>igation.  The URP has indicated that it plans to continue to challenge the =<br/>settlement and the original OPUC order allowing PGE recovery of and a retur=<br/>n on its investment in Trojan.=20<br/><br/>=09Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions.  Although no assuranc=<br/>es can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matte=<br/>rs will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or res=<br/>ults of operations.<br/><br/>Other Contingencies<br/>=09Environmental Matters.  Enron is subject to extensive federal, state and=<br/> local environmental laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations requ=<br/>ire expenditures in connection with the construction of new facilities, the=<br/> operation of existing facilities and for remediation at various operating =<br/>sites.  The implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments is expected to r=<br/>esult in increased operating expenses.  These increased operating expenses =<br/>are not expected to have a material impact on Enron's financial position or=<br/> results of operations.<br/><br/>=09Enron's natural gas pipeline companies conduct soil and groundwater reme=<br/>diation on a number of their facilities.  Enron does not expect to incur ma=<br/>terial expenditures in connection with soil and groundwater remediation.<br/><br/>=09Developments in the California Power Market.  During 2000, prices for wh=<br/>olesale electricity in California significantly increased as a result of a =<br/>combination of factors, including higher natural gas prices, reduction in a=<br/>vailable hydroelectric generation resources, increased demand, over-relianc=<br/>e on the spot market for electricity and limitations on supply.  California=<br/>'s regulatory regime instituted in 1996 permitted wholesale price increases=<br/> but froze retail prices below market levels.  The resulting disparity betw=<br/>een costs of supply and customer revenues caused two of California's public=<br/> utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) and Southern California E=<br/>dison Company (SCE), to accrue substantial unrecovered wholesale power cost=<br/>s and certain obligations related to the difference between third party pow=<br/>er purchase costs and frozen rates charged to retail customers.  PG&E and S=<br/>CE have defaulted on or are challenging payments owed for certain outstandi=<br/>ng obligations, including wholesale power purchased through the California =<br/>Power Exchange (the Power Exchange), from the California Independent System=<br/> Operator (the Independent System Operator), and from qualifying facilities=<br/>.  In addition, PG&E and the Power Exchange each have filed a voluntary pet=<br/>ition for bankruptcy.<br/><br/>=09Various legislative, regulatory and legal remedies to the energy situati=<br/>on in California have been implemented or are being pursued, and may result=<br/> in restructuring of markets in California and elsewhere.  Additional initi=<br/>atives are likely at the Federal, state and local level, but it is not poss=<br/>ible to predict their outcome at this time.<br/><br/>=09Enron has entered into a variety of transactions with California utiliti=<br/>es, the Power Exchange, the Independent System Operator, end users of energ=<br/>y in California, and other third parties, and is owed amounts by certain of=<br/> these entities.  Enron has established reserves related to such activities=<br/> and believes that the combination of such reserves in accounts receivables=<br/> and other credit offsets with such parties are adequate to cover its expos=<br/>ure to developments in the California power market.  Due to the uncertainti=<br/>es involved, the ultimate outcome of the California power situation cannot =<br/>be predicted, but Enron believes these matters will not have a material adv=<br/>erse impact on Enron's financial condition or results of operations.<br/><br/>=09India.  Enron indirectly owns 50% of the net voting interest in Dabhol P=<br/>ower Company (Dabhol), which owns a 740 megawatt power plant and is constru=<br/>cting an additional 1,444 megawatt power plant together with an LNG regasif=<br/>ication facility (collectively Phase II) in India.  Enron accounts for its =<br/>investment in Dabhol under the equity method and the debt of Dabhol is non-=<br/>recourse to Enron.  Dabhol has been in dispute with the Maharashtra State E=<br/>lectricity Board (MSEB), the purchaser of power from Dabhol, and the Govern=<br/>ment of Maharashtra (GOM) and the federal government of India (GOI), the gu=<br/>arantors of payments by the MSEB pursuant to the terms and conditions of th=<br/>e power purchase agreements (PPA) and the other project documents.  The con=<br/>tract disputes relate principally to (a) the failure by the MSEB to pay cer=<br/>tain capacity and energy payments under the PPA, and the failure of the GOM=<br/> and GOI to satisfy certain guarantee obligations under the project documen=<br/>ts and (b) MSEB's statements that MSEB has \"rescinded\" the PPA and MSEB is =<br/>therefore no longer bound by the PPA.  As a result of such disputes, the Ph=<br/>ase II lenders have stopped funding the continued construction of Phase II =<br/>and the construction contractors have terminated the construction contracts=<br/> for non-payment.  There is no assurance that Dabhol will be able to resolv=<br/>e such disputes to its favor and to successfully collect on and to enforce =<br/>any judgment or settlement.  However, Dabhol believes that the MSEB's actio=<br/>ns are in clear violation of the terms of the PPA, and Dabhol intends to pu=<br/>rsue all available legal remedies under the project documents.  As a result=<br/> of these disputes, the 740 megawatt power plant is not being dispatched by=<br/> MSEB.  Further, Dabhol has suspended construction activity on Phase II.  E=<br/>nron does not believe that any contract dispute related to Dabhol will have=<br/> a material adverse impact on Enron's financial condition or results of ope=<br/>rations.\n",

I have been asked by Sally to take the lead on <br/>meeting this objective.  For the last several weeks, I have been involved in <br/>an extensive review of the London office controls and procedures for their <br/>gas and power trading businesses.  We have used the findings of this review <br/>to start developing an assessment of controls, standards and measurement <br/>methodology for the London office.<br/><br/>In order to work towards our goal of developing global trading standards <br/>across Enron, we need to perform the same controls and standards assessment <br/>for the Houston gas and power businesses (we will assess global products and <br/>other commodities traded at a later date).  I will be in Houston Tuesday and <br/>Wednesday of next week to help facilitate this process.<br/><br/>I have scheduled a meeting next Weds., May 17 from 9:00 - 11:30 in EB49C1 so <br/>that we may review our controls, define the standards of meeting those <br/>control requirements and assess the risk associated with those controls not <br/>operating properly.  Before that meeting, I would like for all of you to <br/>develop for your  respective functional responsibilities the following:<br/> - a listing of all controls your group is responsible for (i.e. cash <br/>collections are timely)<br/> - a proposed standard that will ensure each control is being met to its <br/>maximum effectiveness (i.e. cash is collected within 30 days of deal date <br/>with            exceptions noted)<br/> - a quantitative measure to allow performance monitoring of each standard <br/>(i.e. % of cash collected within 30 days)<br/> - a description of current capabilities to calculate, track and report each <br/>measurement (i.e. automated A/R aging report)<br/><br/>I would urge you to be as detailed as possible in listing your control <br/>functions and to solicit feedback from your managers and leads.  A lot of <br/>work has already been done to identify this information so I would hope time <br/>requirements for this will not be extensive.  I have attached a worksheet to <br/>be completed with the information discussed above.  I have also attached a <br/>high level summary of proposed gas and power standards to use a guideline but <br/>it is certainly not all-inclusive and should be revised as necessary.<br/><br/>As discussed above, we will review the controls and standards listings for <br/>each functional group in the Weds. meeting and also assess the risk <br/>associated with each control.  I would like to achieve consensus on gas and <br/>power operating standards for Houston by the end of the meeting.  Let me know <br/>if you have any questions or comments regarding this process.  I look forward <br/>to seeing you next week.<br/><br/><br/>\n",

In particular,the corporate decision about what the end game and<br/>desired end result are to consist in.<br/><br/>Accordingly,I now look upon the proposed GOM and MSEB arbitrations as<br/>primarily a means of setting up the case for PPA termination in due course.<br/>In the light of this:-<br/><br/>(1) The MSEB arbitration ought now to deal with misdeclaration and claim<br/>payment of the January 2001 billing,as well as the December 2001 billing. I<br/>expect that we shall also put in the subsequent misdeclaration episodes. I<br/>see little value in putting in the older claims (i.e., the arrears and sums<br/>withheld),mainly because Kelly Quinn's analysis of them tends to show that<br/>many of DPC's claims are dud.<br/><br/>(2) There is no longer any useful purpose served in stripping the MSEB<br/>arbitration down to misdeclaration only. Further,not merely I am more<br/>convinced than I was that the MSEB was not entitled to withhold against the<br/>December 2000 billing,but I think that DPC has a 50:50 case that the MSEB<br/>was obliged to pay the January 2001 billing clean.<br/><br/>(3) As I see it,there will be two arbitrations against GOM (the SSA and the<br/>Guarantee) and one against the MSEB. However,if we wish to harass the GOM<br/>and set up further PPA termination grounds,we might well wish to do<br/>something forceful and litigious when (as I confidently predict) the notice<br/>under the escrow agreement is not responded to by the MSEB and the Indian<br/>banks. The notice only really works as and when the Indian banks are<br/>threatened.<br/><br/>-----Original Message-----<br/>From: Bruce.Lundstrom@enron.com [mailto:Bruce.Lundstrom@enron.com]<br/>Sent: Sunday, April 08, 2001 7:12 PM<br/>To: cwalker@linklaters.com<br/>Cc: Sandeep.Katwala@enron.com; Rob.Walls@enron.com<br/>Subject: MSEB and GOM Arbitrations<br/><br/><br/>Christopher -<br/><br/>Help me to understand the plan for the MSEB and GOM arbitrations for<br/>December, January and Interest.

That is more of a challenge than you might imagine in this<br/>complicated deregulated world we find ourselves in. I believe we are making<br/>a good start.<br/><br/>\"Last year I was able to sign legislation that basically stabilized rates in<br/>San Diego, and I supported hundreds of millions of dollars for renewable<br/>power resources, like the photovotaic program you see behind us, to support<br/>financially and also encourage voluntary support for conservation programs<br/>up and down the state to reduce California's use of electricity by 10% when<br/>we had a Stage Two alert and to encourage demand management programs by a<br/>number of industries, including the technology and grocery industry that<br/>reduce the demand on any given day.<br/><br/>\"Having said all that, this market is dysfunctional. It is a very difficult<br/>environment for deregulation to work. And I repeat again, deregulation can<br/>work but only if all parties act responsibly and if the market is<br/>competitive, which it is not.<br/><br/>\"I was pleased to see that Secretary Richardson agrees with me that this<br/>market is dysfunctional and I am also somewhat pleased by the initial<br/>reports of the action that FERC took today. It is a mixed blessing. They do<br/>recognize that we are operating in a dysfunctional market and they do agree<br/>that the rates are not just or reasonable. However, they did not, as I<br/>encouraged, order rebates to the consumers and businesses in San Diego who<br/>were literally gouged and for the profiteering and market manipulation that<br/>San Diego had to suffer through.<br/><br/>\"FERC also decided to abolish the stakeholder boards at the ISO-independent<br/>service operator, and the power exchange. FERC agrees with me that they are<br/>self-serving and either contributed to or participated directly in market<br/>manipulation. However, it is unclear what will replace those boards. The<br/>good news is that they agree with our premise that the market is<br/>dysfunctional, rates are unreasonable and unjust. The bad news is there is<br/>no immediate remedy for ratepayers here in California.<br/><br/>\"I believe the marketplace generally makes good decisions but I am not going<br/>to be a prisoner of ideology. I do not want some knee jerk reactions to<br/>drive our economy or our consumers to their knees. I have seen time and<br/>again the most right wing conservatives in San Diego that say, 'please give<br/>us money to bail us out from the increased prices that have descended upon<br/>us.' So as I have long understood, economics drives politics and at the<br/>moment we are shipping about $6 billion more out of this state for<br/>electricity than we paid about 12 months ago. That has got to stop.<br/><br/>Question inaudible.<br/><br/>\"It appears that the FERC said they are going to restructure it and this<br/>again suggestes the complexity that we have to deal with. Once the state<br/>deregulated distribution from power generation in 1996, the PUC basically<br/>surrendered most of its control over the purchase and acquisition of<br/>electricity for California and that control reverted to the Federal Energy<br/>Regulatory Commission. As I read the initial reports from the FERC decision<br/>today, they are saying the ISO and the power exchange are dominated by stake<br/>holder members and they think that is ill advised, as do I. There will be<br/>new boards established and we will tell you how they are established. So it<br/>is unclear whether we have the authority to, independent of the FERC to<br/>establish our own ISO and power exchange. My initial reading of the press<br/>reports suggest that we may not. That is something that has to be cleared up<br/>over the next several days.<br/><br/>Question inaudible.<br/><br/>\"We have had a series of meetings over the past two months with all kinds of<br/>stakeholders from turn to utilities to generators, other consumer groups<br/>from San Diego and we are trying to forge a consensus which will indicate<br/>the path that we will take. I am not at the point where I can tell you what<br/>that consensus is. But we are making progress.<br/><br/>Question inaudible.<br/><br/>\"That we are going to fight for consumers, that they should not bear the<br/>full brunt of this experiment in deregulation. At best it was premature and<br/>the market place was not prepared. The marketplace is dysfunctional, it is<br/>not competitive. There is a far greater demand for electricity than we can<br/>generate in this state. I want them to know that we are working night and<br/>day to find a solution that will ensure that they are not the guinea pigs<br/>for this ill-conceived scheme.<br/><br/>\"I am pleased that FERC has recognized that the marketplace is<br/>dysfunctional, recognized that rates are unjust and unreasonable. I am not<br/>pleased that they have not offered any solutions. It looks like we are going<br/>to have to wait until November 9th at the hearing in front of FERC at which<br/>their full plan will be unveiled and there will be a chance to comment,<br/>critique and modify and then thirty days after that the plan will be adopted<br/>in full or in part. This is a very important meeting in which our<br/>administration will be fully represented and I hope to be able to inform the<br/>consumers of this state more fully at the conclusion of that meeting if not<br/>before.<br/><br/>\"I believe refunds are due and necessary. FERC and the Secretary of Energy<br/>have concurred with my assessment that these rates are not just and<br/>reasonable and I believe that FERC has the power to order refunds. It is<br/>unclear whether they believe they have the power to do it or not. Congress<br/>could settle<br/><br/>the question by simply passing legislation to ensure that. Over the long<br/>haul, by that I mean 5 to 10 to 15 years, I believe deregulation can work<br/>but only if we have a competitive marketplace and if all parties act<br/>responsibly. As I told everyone involved in this process, some people may<br/>win the battle but lose the war if they insist on gouging every consumer and<br/>citizen of this state. The people of California will stand up; they will<br/>rise up and take matters into their own hands. The problem with deregulation<br/>lowering rates, is that we have not seen them and frankly none are on the<br/>immediate horizon.<br/><br/>Question inaudible.<br/><br/>\"Let me just say two things. I think there is plenty of blame to go around<br/>but there is no question that the generators who happen to be out-of-state<br/>companies are charging us 600 to 700% more for the very same electricity<br/>that we purchased last year. You cannot add value to an electron. An<br/>electron is an electron. They are simply taking advantage of an ill-advised<br/>scheme envisioned in the 1996 act to charge what the market will bear. I am<br/>standing up and saying no more. We are not going to take this lying down. We<br/>are fighting back. The difficulty is that we do not have the power that we<br/>used to have. The state surrendered a lot of that power when Governor Wilson<br/>signed the deregulation bill. Actually carried by Jim Brulte and co authored<br/>by Steve Peace, they were the two driving forces as they will be happy, well<br/>maybe not so happy, to acknowledge. It may have seemed like a good idea in<br/>1996 but I did not participate in that debate and I don't have a comment on<br/>whether it was a good idea then. But clearly in the year 2000 it is not a<br/>good idea. Again our problem is we can describe the problem and we have some<br/>limited authority over the power the utilities have not yet sold off to the<br/>generators which is about 35-40% of their facilities that they used to own<br/>and we do not have control over the facilities they have sold off to the out<br/>of state generators that purchased them. FERC has control over them and it<br/>is unclear whether we even have control to establish our own ISO and our own<br/>power exchange and if we did I would have them reconstituted. There is no<br/>question about that. They are too self serving too inbred and too incestuous<br/>and do not represent consumer interests. Plus you cannot hold anyone<br/>accountable there is no one public official on any one of those boards. You<br/>cannot hold anyone accountable and they determine largely what the price of<br/>electricity is and how any shortages are allocated throughout the state. So<br/>these are serious responsibilities given to these stakeholder boards and no<br/>public official participates on those boards.<br/><br/>Question inaudible.<br/><br/>\"You are more right than wrong. As the chief executive of this state I am<br/>going to advocate what I believe is in the best interests of our consumers<br/>and businesses. Electricity is the lifeblood of our economy. Without water<br/>and electricity, consumers and businesses are just simply out of luck.<br/>Whether or not this deregulatory scheme in 1996 made sense then is a<br/>question not worth debating today. But it does not make sense today.<br/>Unfortunately that plan adopted by our legislature and governor Wilson in<br/>1996 surrendered control over generating facilities that the PUC used to<br/>monitor and supervise. So it is unclear how much power is left to the state.<br/>FERC seems to be suggesting<br/><br/>today, not much. Obviously as governor of this state I want to assert as<br/>much authority as I possibly can because I know I will be held accountable<br/>and obviously I would like the authority to go along with the responsibility<br/>that is laid at my doorstep.<br/><br/>\"I have one goal in mind: to do our level best to make sure that our lights<br/>stay on and our economy has the benefit of the electricity it needs and the<br/>prices are reasonable. What path we take to that matters less to me than<br/>that we get to that result. Because that is the result that is necessary to<br/>allow consumers to go about their lives and business to function and make a<br/>profit and hire more people and to sustain our economic growth which in turn<br/>provides the resources that allow us to finance the schools and protect the<br/>environment and provide healthcare. Without electricity there is no economic<br/>growth, without economic growth we do not have the resources to do justice<br/>to our public obligations.

The following is a brief=<br/>=20<br/>outline of an EPMI/EES answer to the complaint.  The answer is due Friday. =<br/>=20<br/>Please send me any comments ASAP.=20<br/><br/>? The complaint should be rejected because it wrongly assumes that the=20<br/>Commission has no option to ensure just and reasonable rates but to require=<br/>=20<br/>cost based rates because there is no low cost solution to the problems=20<br/>currently faced by the California markets.  We should attach our white pape=<br/>r=20<br/>to our protest and state that the paper explains how these problems could b=<br/>e=20<br/>solved at little or no cost to the customers. =20<br/>? I list here, for your information, the reasons CMUA claims that markets a=<br/>re=20<br/>not competitive (these reasons will not be re-listed in the pleading).=20<br/>? 2000 prices greatly exceeded 1999 prices without regard to load.<br/>? zonal constrained prices, even in the off-peak hours, do not reflect=20<br/>competitive outcomes for low load conditions. =20<br/>? even small players can be price setters<br/>? The changes required are additional generation, transmission, and demand=<br/>=20<br/>response and will cost tens of millions of dollars and take lengthy periods=<br/>=20<br/>of time to implement.<br/>? There is no evidence that markets will ensure just and reasonable rates i=<br/>n=20<br/>the near future.<br/>? CMUA asserts that with the advent of electric restructuring, the Commissi=<br/>on=20<br/>has increasingly allowed energy and ancillary services to be sold at=20<br/>market-based rates.  However, CMUA is wrong in the context of the West wher=<br/>e=20<br/>there has been market-based trading of electricity before electric=20<br/>restructuring, since the FERC approved the Western Systems Power Pool=01,s=<br/>=20<br/>contract in 1991.  The Commission=01,s rules didn=01,t create the wholesale=<br/> market=20<br/>in the past, the market did and it was running fine until it was messed up =<br/>by=20<br/>certain market rules were imposed that are enumerated in our paper.  The=20<br/>problem is not the market-based rates.  The problem is the market rules.<br/>? CMUA=01,s motion does not address how market-based rates would be calcula=<br/>ted=20<br/>for marketers that do not sell power from their own resources, let alone=20<br/>reflect the trading of basis points.  Almost all of the power EPMI sells is=<br/>=20<br/>power it has bought from some other marketer or generator.  Many of EPMI=01=<br/>,s=20<br/>deals are done through brokers such that EPMI does not find out the identit=<br/>y=20<br/>of the seller until after a deal has been struck.  Accordingly, EPMI gets n=<br/>o=20<br/>information about the cost of the underlying generation.=20<br/>? If FERC doesn=01,t try to fix the market but simply takes away our=20<br/>market-based rates, since there=01,s is no basis for us to set cost based r=<br/>ates,=20<br/>we would go out of business.  Besides there=01,s no reason to take away our=<br/>=20<br/>market-based rates because we are not exercising market power.  So if FERC=<br/>=20<br/>could fix the problem with a less onerous solution (as we=01,ve proposed in=<br/> our=20<br/>white paper), requiring cost-based rates would constitute a regulatory taki=<br/>ng=20<br/>of our business and we would have to be compensated using the constitutiona=<br/>l=20<br/>standard.=20<br/> CMUA does not provide any expert testimony to support its position.  Rathe=<br/>r,=20<br/>its evidence is =01&drawn from materials prepared and testimony delivered b=<br/>y the=20<br/>California ISO and other public sources.=018  Beyond the difficult evidenti=<br/>ary=20<br/>issue posed by the fact that CMUA cannot swear to the veracity of informati=<br/>on=20<br/>produced by third parties, EPMI would have no opportunity to conduct=20<br/>discovery or cross-examine of such =01&witnesses.=018=20<br/>\n",

They list a fundraising goal of $1,660,000 (just a bit <br/>aggressive!)  If we are not able to make an additional contribution,  he asks <br/>that we renew our 2001 annual membership of $40,000 now instead of in January <br/>of 2001.  If we do anything, my recommendation would be to cut a check now <br/>for our annual membership (the downside of doing that, of course, is that <br/>they will hit us a number of times in 2001 for incremental contributions to <br/>specific events/causes).<br/><br/>I bring this to your attention for two reasons-one is that if I know Governor <br/>Gilmore, he will probably make a call directly to Ken Lay and you and Steve <br/>may want to have an answer available if Mr. Lay gets the call.  Secondly, <br/>what are your thoughts on my response to RGA?  My preference would be to not <br/>commit to any additional dollars, with a fall back that if Gilmore does call <br/>Lay and he wants to respond positively, we then commit to renewing our <br/>membership early.  <br/><br/><mark>I think you are pretty busy over the next few days--please respond as your</mark> <br/>schedule allows.

Cost is approx Cdn $1000/person for <br/>flight and accomodation (thursday - sunday). As you know, we have done this <br/>for a number of years but I'm not sure what approvals were obtained in the <br/>past as it was either your group or Lavorato's group at the time. This would <br/>involve Origination only as Trading is doing an offsite in conjunction with <br/>the rest of Shankman's group. It should be noted also that we decided not to <br/>attend the Masters this year as we didnt think it generated enough business <br/>following last years trip -  this cut our expenses substantially.

      "<mark>Kate, take a quick look at this would you?</mark><br/><br/>Group,<br/><br/>Going forward we will be transacting with Enron Canada Corp on an over-the-=<br/>counter basis.  We will provide them with a bid and an offer suitable for b=<br/>uying from or selling to them non-firm energy.  Enron Canada will contact u=<br/>s each morning to inquire about possiblities for export and import.  We sho=<br/>uld be familiar with the Alberta Power Pool forecast and be aware of the co=<br/>nversion from CDD to USD.  The lead or NW trader will provide Enron Canada =<br/>with their estimate or feel of the market.  Enron Canada will be trying nea=<br/>rly every hour to obtain non-firm transmission.  If this is an unwise pract=<br/>ive from a risk-reward standpoint based on our understanding of the market,=<br/> WE need to tell them, as they are losing $6.40 per mw CDD on unused tranny=<br/> with zero chance for return.  Further, Enron Canada wants the opportunity =<br/>to transact with other counterparties at the BC Border.  If we cannot use t=<br/>heir energy they have asked to be able to contact WWP, IPC or TransAlta aft=<br/>er giving us first look to attempt to recoup some of their loss.  I do not =<br/>see a need for this and think there is potential for embarrassment and dama=<br/>ge to customer relations.  If we are in contact with Enron Canada before ha=<br/>nd (start of the day, top of the hour, etc.) we should be able to get them =<br/>the best price for their energy.  Be very clear in your dealings with the N=<br/>W counterparty that the energy is non-firm.  Determine a book-out price if =<br/>necessary to solve problems with physical flow.  We are basically buying a =<br/>put or a call.  Finally, I would like to see the communication with Enron C=<br/>anada improve.  Personal experience and observation has us not communicatin=<br/>g with them as closely as possible and typically only speaking with their r=<br/>eal-time group at the bottom.  I feel we can do better.  I want to prevent =<br/>a repeat of this weekend (ECC selling/buying from a counterparty in the US =<br/>without our knowledge) and do not want the NW being scoured by both Enron C=<br/>anada and Enron North America.  This is counterproductive for both of us fo=<br/>r obvious reasons.  Providing a bid/offer and being prepared to act on it i=<br/>s a change in our relationship with Enron Canada.  This should force a rene=<br/>wed emphasis on communication and market fundamentals that should only be b=<br/>eneficial.

Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.<br/><br/>Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.

We can agree to remove the loss of bargain concept but=<br/> not the other two damage concepts.  We do not agree to the removal of \"cos=<br/>t of funding\" since this can be a very real issue when a replacement transa=<br/>ction requires a premium to be paid because of the off-market position.  Pr=<br/>emiums for such positions will have a cost of funding component.  The remov=<br/>al of the concept of \"loss or cost incurred as a result of terminating, liq=<br/>uidating, or obtaining or reestablishing a hedge or trading position\" is al=<br/>so a very real factor in calculating damages.  It may very well be that the=<br/> termination of a hedge is the more cost effective alternative to replacing=<br/> the transaction.  Furthermore, the you can obtain the same effect of termi=<br/>nating a hedge by entering into an offsetting transaction (the equivalent o=<br/>f a replacement transaction) rather than an outright termination with the h=<br/>edge counterparty. Because the termination of a hedge is the other side of =<br/>the coin, so to speak, it makes sense to leave it in the definition of Loss=<br/>.  We can clarify that such losses and costs are without duplication, which=<br/> I think was one of your outside counsels concerns.  The definition of Loss=<br/> as was written is designed so that the Non-defaulting party can recover th=<br/>e actual damages occasioned by the Defaulting Party's failure to perform.  =<br/>If the Defaulting Party objects to the Non-defaulting Party's calculation t=<br/>hen such calculation would be subject to negotiation or litigation and fina=<br/>l determination by a New York court. =20<br/><br/>We would propose modifying your changes to read as follows:=20<br/><br/>Insert the following into Part 1(e), after the period at the end thereof. =<br/>=20<br/><br/>\"The definition of Loss shall be amended and restated in its entirety as fo=<br/>llows:=20<br/><br/>\"Loss\" means, with respect to this Agreement or one or more Terminated Tran=<br/>sactions, as the case may be, and a party, the Termination Currency Equival=<br/>ent of an amount that party reasonably determines in good faith and in a co=<br/>mmercially reasonable manner its total losses and costs (or gain, in which =<br/>case expressed as a negative number), without duplication, in connection wi=<br/>th this Agreement or that Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Tra=<br/>nsactions, as the case may be, including any cost of funding or, at the ele=<br/>ction of such party but without duplication, loss or cost incurred as a res=<br/>ult of its terminating, liquidating, obtaining or reestablishing any hedge =<br/>or related trading position (or any gain resulting from any of them).   to =<br/>be equal to the actual replacement cost to that party in entering into a re=<br/>placement transaction.  Loss does not include any loss of bargain, cost of =<br/>funding or, loss or cost incurred as a result of its terminating, liquidati=<br/>ng, obtaining or reestablishing any hedge or related trading positions.  Fu=<br/>rthermore, Loss does not include loss of bargain, or  a party's legal fees =<br/>and out-of-pocket expenses referred to under Section 11.  A party will dete=<br/>rmine its Loss as of the relevant Early Termination Date, or, if that is no=<br/>t reasonably practicable, as of the earliest date thereafter as is reasonab=<br/>ly practicable.  A party may (but need not) determine its Loss by reference=<br/> to quotations of relevant rates or prices from one or more leading dealers=<br/> in the relevant market.\"<br/><br/><br/> If the concept of a Replacement Value is preferable to you we are also wil=<br/>ling to use the following definition, which was originally drafted by Goldm=<br/>an Sachs, in lieu of the Loss definition.<br/> =20<br/>\"Replacement Value\" , means, with respect to each Terminated Transaction or=<br/> group of Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, and a party, an amou=<br/>nt that the party (the \"Determining Party\") or its agent determines in good=<br/> faith and in a commercially reasonable manner to be its total losses and c=<br/>osts (or gains, in which case expressed as a negative number) in connection=<br/> with that Terminated Transaction or group of terminated Transactions.  A D=<br/>etermining Party (or its agent) may determine Replacement Values for all Te=<br/>rminated Transactions, any group of Terminated Transactions or individual T=<br/>erminated Transactions, and may apply different valuation methods to differ=<br/>ent Transactions or groups of Transactions.   A Determining Party (or its a=<br/>gent) will determine Replacement Values for all Terminated Transactions as =<br/>of the Early Termination Date, or, if that would not be commercially reason=<br/>able, as of the latest date or dates before or the earliest date or dates a=<br/>fter the Early Termination Date as would be commercially reasonable under t=<br/>hen prevailing circumstances.<br/><br/>The definition of Loss would be replaced throughout the ISDA by the definit=<br/>ion of Replacement Value. =20<br/><br/>We hope that one of these definitions will work for you.  Please call if yo=<br/>u have any questions or comments on the definitions.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/>Brent\n",

At a minimum, we're trying to demonstrate the <br/>following:  In high-volatility electricity environments, for those EES <br/>customers who employ their own capital, their usual capital-project IRR <br/>hurdles may be lowered slightly in the special case of DSM projects, to allow <br/>for the extra value derived from reduced risk exposure stemming from reduced <br/>power consumption/dependence.<br/><br/>I'm pushing the boundaries of real-option theory (and good sense) and viewing <br/>a DSM project as a series of options, the values of which are additive.  <br/>First is the option to engage in the DSM project itself; which, if we <br/>exercise the option immediately, can be valued intrinsically through a simple <br/>NPV analysis.  Second is a strip of put options to generate \"negawatts,\" <br/>extending over the useful life of a DSM installation, the cumulative value of <br/>which is an extrinsic value associated with the DSM project.  These options <br/>are exercised sequentially--over the life of the DSM installation--whenever <br/>the customer experiences a dramatic, stochastic spike in electricity price, <br/>associated with a lognormal price distribution.  I'm calling the value of <br/>this strip a \"residual time value\" associated with the original DSM option.  <br/>If we can add this residual time value to the NPV and derive a total value <br/>that is quantitatively higher than a simple NPV alone,  we may be able to <br/>help the customer get more projects approved, even at the original high IRR <br/>hurdle.<br/><br/>Alternatively, and more feasibly, we'd like to give these same customers a <br/>\"qualitative\" tool with which they can convince their finance gatekeepers to <br/>lower--for DSM projects--their standard capital-project IRR hurdle .  The <br/>attached presentation is a first attempt at this qualitative argument.<br/><br/>We intend to use this only as a sales and marketing tool, to allow at least <br/>one of our customers who has an onerously high hurdle rate to manage around <br/>his company's internal capital-budgeting requirements.  He has set aside a <br/>large sum of money for DSM projects, but will only be able to spend a small <br/>portion of it under his company's current capital budgeting methodology, <br/>which does not take into account forward commodity price volatility.<br/><br/>In your opinion, is there any hope in devising a quantitative justification, <br/>or will we have to stick with the qualitative argument as described in the <br/>attached presentation?  In other words, is it possible to quantify \"residual <br/>time value\" as I've defined it above? Or, even better, are you aware of a <br/>more practical way of conceptualizing this problem?<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>Jeff Gray<br/><br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/>Vince J Kaminski@ECT<br/>01/05/2001 03:26 PM<br/>To: Jeff M Gray/NA/Enron@ENRON<br/>cc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Alex <br/>Huang/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Gary Hickerson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Michelle D <br/>Cisneros/HOU/ECT@ECT <br/>Subject: Power Plant Model<br/><br/>Jeff,<br/><br/>A few comments on the model:<br/><br/>1.

We could try to lessen our <br/>exposure as much as possible with the lease, and get indemnity from PGL. <br/><br/>Kay<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Fred Mitro@ECT<br/>06/13/2000 01:37 PM<br/>To: Kay Mann/Corp/Enron@Enron<br/>cc: Ben Jacoby/HOU/ECT@ECT, Laura Luce/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rusty <br/>Stevens/Corp/Enron@ENRON <br/><br/>Subject: RE: Torrence Cost Sharing Agreement<br/><br/>Attached is the cost sharing agreement proposed by PERC on the Torrence <br/>site.  It proposes that ENA agree to share all future development costs and <br/>environmental liabilities on the Torrence parcel on a 50/50 basis.  I believe <br/>that there are some inconsistencies between the language in this Agreement <br/>and the PDA signed in April of 2000 (i.e. dates, terms, and the members of <br/>the management committee).<br/><br/>I have informed PERC that it is ENA's policy not to step in the chain of <br/>title on properties with known environmental liabilities.  I have recommended <br/>to PERC that PGL (Peoples regulated utility) buy the Torrence property (they <br/>want if for remediation purposes anyway) from Air Liquide on June 26th and <br/>hold it while PERC and ENA complete the due diligence required to develop a <br/>commercially viable power plant development project. It will be my <br/>recommendation that ENA does not execute this cost sharing agreement as <br/>written.  If the environmental liability risk was removed and stronger <br/>language inserted on the control of going-forward development expenditures <br/>then it would represent a commercially reasonable agreement.  Ideally we <br/>would like this agreement to provide for ENA to market the Torrence and other <br/>development sites (ENA's sell-down strategy) under a known value sharing <br/>formula and transaction financial \"triggers\".  I will discuss this approach <br/>with Laura Luce and Curtis Cole this week.<br/><br/>From a legal perspective, could we structure a long-term lease between PGL <br/>and Torrence Power LLC (PERC & ENA as owners) that could provide commercial <br/>site control to PERC/ENA while leaving the environmental liabilities on the <br/>Torrence property with PGL?  (this would be fitting, because PGL has owned <br/>the property in the past and have likely been the major contributor to the <br/>site's environmental contamination).<br/><br/><mark>Call me to discuss these issues.</mark>  <br/><br/>Fred<br/><br/>---------------------- Forwarded by Fred Mitro/HOU/ECT on 06/13/2000 01:58 PM <br/>---------------------------<br/><br/><br/>s.stawasz@pecorp.com on 06/12/2000 12:59:56 PM<br/>To: Fred.Mitro@enron.com, lluce@enron.com<br/>cc: j.nassos@pecorp.com, j.badeusz@pecorp.com, c.cole@pecorp.com, <br/>de.anderson@pecorp.com, w.morrow@pecorp.com <br/>Subject: RE: Torrence Cost Sharing Agreement<br/><br/><br/>Sorry.

Here's a quick update. We've added about 11,000 new fellow divers to this month's newsletter, which brings us up to about 260,000 PADI Divers worldwide, making this the most widely read newsletter in the industry!<br/><br/>From the entry-level certification numbers we're seeing, you're all doing your part by  bringing many new divers into our great sport.  Please keep up the good work.  <mark>However, PADI and the diving industry do need your help in another way.</mark>  Recently, an Associated Press article, based on a study by the National Sporting Goods Association, was released saying that US participation in scuba diving fell way off in 2000.  I know it's not true because PADI's numbers were up and we represent the lion's share of the market.  So how can you help?  When you're asked to participate in any market survey,  please take a minute to answer the questions and let them know you are not only a diver, but also a PADI diver. When they ask about activities, name scuba.<br/><br/>About a month ago, the Regional Managers (that's our great team of sales/training people who visit retailers and resorts), for PADI Americas had a great sales meeting on Orcas Island in Washington.  We all worked hard and dived hard while we were there.  We stayed at the Rosario Resort (a really cool place by the way!)(http://www.rosarioresort.com)  and would like to thank Ron Kenny from Island Dive and Water Sport for showing us a great time and some fantastic diving. If you're in the area, or just want to dive with a giant octopus, give Ron a call.  Great customer service and good times are guaranteed. Check out Island Dive and Water Sport at www.divesanjuan.com. Be sure to tell Ron that I told you about his operation. I love it when PADI retail and resort operators call me to say someone mentioned the Dear Fellow Diver Newsletter to them!<br/><br/>I'd also like to thank all of you who took the time to review the consultation document  (http://www.padi.com/news/archive/last/052901_wargraves/ ) online and responded in favor of allowing responsible wreck diving, while respecting our underwater cultural heritage.  PADI on behalf of the diving industry at large is making progress on this subject and will keep you informed.<br/><br/>What are you doing from 26-31 July? Well, if you happen to be in Australia, swing by the Sydney Boat Show and say hello to our team from the PADI Asia Pacific office and visit all of our hard working resort and retail members exhibiting there.  This is the largest boat show in the Southern Hemisphere and this year it has a Dive Expo area. Check it out at www.sydneyboatshow.com.au. and be sure to tell the PADI staff at the show that you read about it in this newsletter.<br/>If you've recently checked the PADI homepage, you may have seen a very historic dive industry news item (http://www.padi.com/padi/offices/americas/news/todaynews/062701_historique/). On 13 June 2001, PADI and the F?d?ration Fran?aise d'?tudes et de Sports Sous-Marin (FFESSM/French Federation) agreed to work together in developing France's dive industry. The historic accord represents the start of mutual cooperation for the benefit of France's dive industry and divers worldwide.   Jean-Claude Monachon, CEO PADI Europe, summed it up best by saying, \"You can come to France and dive, that's important. Divers from Europe and around the world can come to this country and experience our fabulous diving. That benefits both France and diving.\"<br/><br/>A little over a month ago, the youth chamber of commerce (JCE) from Fr?jus / St. Rapha?l, France conducted a beach cleanup that attracted a lot of media attention.  All summer long in the port of St. Rapha?l on the Mediterranean, Project AWARE pamphlets are being passed out to divers and visitors alike.  Good job to everyone involved!<br/>The Protect the Living Reef initiative is a big success with many Project AWARE Patrons (https://www.padimembers.com/Sforms/aware/default.htm) requesting brochures, stickers and lapel pins.  The new manual, A.W.A.R.E. Our World, Our Water (http://www.padi.com/aware/get_involved/LivingReef/news/022601_ourworld_ourwater/) is really taking off as well. If you haven't read it yet, go by your PADI Dive Center or Resort and get your copy today.  And, don't forget the deadline for the Project AWARE Photo Contest (http://www.padi.com/aware/photo_2001/ ) is July 31st.<br/>Now, get your calendar out and circle September 15th. Then, visit your PADI Dive Center or Resort and find out how you can participate in this year's International Clean-Up Day.  It's not too early to begin working with your local dive facility or organizing your own cleanup.  For details on any of the global Project AWARE programs, visit http://www.padi.com/aware/.<br/>I am buying drinks again this year at the PADI Diving Society's Total Submersion event in Grand Cayman 8-15 November (http://www.padi.com/ptn/weeklyspecial/).  I will be there for the first few days, so if you catch me there and tell me you're a Dear Fellow Diver Newsletter reader, I'll buy you a drink (underage readers get soda!) We've already got more people going than last year, so don't delay, book your trip now!  Visit your PADI Dive Center or Resort, or contact PADI Travel Network for details.<br/><br/>Last but not least, for you last minute travelers, it's not too late to join Bob Coleman, Director of Marketing and Malene Thompson, Manager of Public Relations for PADI Americas during Cayman Country http://www.padi.com/padi/offices/americas/news/travelnews/070201_cometocaymancountry/, August 1-5 and 8-12. Country music stars (and PADI divers) Travis Tritt, The Wilkinsons, Rascal Flats (winner of the Country Music Association's Best New Group) and SheDaisy are scheduled to perform, along with favorites the Kinleys and Chris Cagle.  Again, contact your PADI Dive Center or PADI Travel Network to make it happen. If you run into Bob, be sure to tell him you read the Dear Fellow Diver Newsletter. He might just have something for you!<br/><br/>Are you going diving this weekend?  If not, please do me one more favor. Take this newsletter into your local PADI facility and tell them Brian said to stop by and ask what's new?  They will not only appreciate the visit, but while you're there you can begin planning your next dive adventure, check out the latest in dive equipment or move up the diving ladder by signing up for your next PADI course!<br/><br/>Now, get a friend and go diving!<br/><br/>Brian Cronin.\n",

We are still waiting on a couple of responses. I won't name<br/>names. You know who you are.<br/><br/><mark>Please also review the attached e-mail from Patricia Hogan at Goldman Sachs</mark><br/>regarding the appropriate Platt's references. She suggests that the Platt's<br/>reference in each definition should be to the version of Platt's that is<br/>published in the relevant region. Please let me know as soon as possible<br/>whether you agree with her suggestion. If you agree with her suggestion,<br/>which I believe is largely mechanical, I would ask that those who took<br/>responsiblity for a particular commodity let us know the proper Platt's<br/>reference for the commodity and delivery point. Otherwise, we will assume<br/>that Tricia's suggestions should be followed.<br/><br/>I look forward to wrapping up this project in the next ten days, so please<br/>respond promptly.<br/><br/>Bob Pickel<br/><br/>-----Original Message-----<br/>From: Hogan, Patricia [mailto:patricia.hogan@gs.com]<br/>Sent: Monday, December 27, 1999 12:07 PM<br/>To: 'rpickel@isda.org'; kellis@cravath.com<br/>Cc: 'Corrinne Greasley'; Marcus, Aaron; Prince, Keir<br/>Subject: 1999 Supplement to the 1993 Commodity Derivatives Definitions<br/><br/><br/> We have reviewed the Reference Price Sources for the commodities<br/>that have been assigned to us.  I will forward our changes, amendments and<br/>updates under separate cover.<br/><br/> In the course of reviewing the Price Sources, we came across one<br/>issue that was not discussed on the recent conference call, but is one about<br/>which we have strong feelings.  We believe that the Price Source used for a<br/>particular commodity should reflect the geographic source of the commodity,<br/>e.g., Platt's Asia-Pacific for Asian commodities, Platt's European,<br/>Marketscan or Platt's Crude Marketwire for European commodities and Platt's<br/>Oilgram for North American commodities.  While reviewing the Reference Price<br/>Sources for Fuel Oil, we found that in many cases only Platt's Oilgram is<br/>listed, even though the product is European or Asian.  We would prefer to<br/>delete the references to Platt's Oilgram for products outside of North<br/>America.  However, we understand that such a step cannot be taken without a<br/>discussion with the wider group (which may not be feasible at this point).<br/>If such a discussion is not feasible, we would like (if possible) to include<br/>the European or Asian-Pacific price source in the Supplement along with the<br/>U.S. price source for all products (including those commodities we have not<br/>reviewed and commented on).<br/><br/> I apologize for bringing this issue up so late in the process.<br/>Please call me, Keir Prince (011 44 171 774 5004) or Aaron Marcus (357-9514)<br/>if you would like to discuss.<br/><br/><br/><br/>>  __________________________________________________<br/>><br/>>  Goldman, Sachs & Co.<br/>>  One New York Plaza, 37th Floor | New York,  NY  10004<br/>>  Tel:  212-357-2751  |  Fax:  212-428-3597<br/>>  email:   patricia.hogan@gs.com<br/>><br/>><br/>>  Patricia L.

Present were Don Sevrens, news <br/>editor/insight section; Bill Osborne, senior editor/opinion; Jim Gogek, <br/>editorial writer; Bernie Jones, editor, opinion pages; Craig Rose, the <br/>reporter who has written extensively on the topic, and a photographer.<br/><br/>My two primary messages were that (1) wholesale and retail competition is <br/>working elsewhere, particularly in Pennsylvania, and can eventually work in <br/>California if the rules are changed, and (2) California has a severe supply <br/>shortage and needs to focus on providing incentives for new generation and <br/>expediting the permitting process.  I was subtly trying to get across the <br/>message that leadership was needed to help Californians deal with the need to <br/>reconcile their environmental and land use goals with the need to bring their <br/>power supply and demand into balance.  I, of course, defended FERC's order on <br/>the causes of the price volatility in California this summer and their lack <br/>of any authority to order retroactive refunds.  I also pointed out that there <br/>were no findings of individual market abuse, so that refunds wouldn't be <br/>warranted even if there was legal authority.  I also pointed out the problems <br/>with price caps.<br/><br/>Other than Craig Rose, who disagreed with me any chance he got, the others <br/>asked good questions and seemed to be listening.  They made the point <br/>repeatedly that this matter is very political, suggesting that a political <br/>compromise with the generators/marketers is necessary.  One of them said he <br/>had heard there was a deal with the generators being negotiated and asked me <br/>my position.  I responded that I had no response.  Anything like that is the <br/>business of individual members.<br/><br/>They indicated that they expected to do a story for this coming Sunday's <br/>Insight Section.  Please give me any feedback you have.<br/><br/>cc:  Stu Ryan, AES by fax<br/>       Jim Macias, Calpine, by fax<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n",

(NASDAQ: INTU<br/>> <http://www.quicken.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=INTU>) announced today<br/>> that its board of directors has selected Stephen M. Bennett as president<br/>> and chief executive officer. Bennett assumes his responsibilities<br/>> immediately, succeeding Bill Campbell, who had been acting chief executive<br/>> since September. Campbell is retiring from day-to-day responsibilities but<br/>> will remain chairman of the board of directors. Bennett was also named to<br/>> the board.<br/>> Bennett, 45, was most recently an executive vice president and member of<br/>> the Office of the CEO at GE Capital, the financial services subsidiary of<br/>> General Electric Corp. GE Capital is the world leader in numerous<br/>> financial industries, including private label credit cards, commercial<br/>> equipment leasing and vendor finance. With $330 billion in assets, GE<br/>> Capital provides 42% of General Electric's overall profits and is among<br/>> the world's largest non-banking financial institutions.<br/>> \"Steve is an outstanding leader from a company renowned for strong<br/>> leadership,\" said Campbell. \"His experience is tailor-made to fit Intuit's<br/>> needs now and in the future. We wanted someone with service industry<br/>> knowledge, who had led large, complex organizations and with proven<br/>> ability to produce fast growth. Steve is the ideal choice to take Intuit<br/>> to the multi-billion dollar level.\"<br/>> \"Intuit is the leader in e-finance. Quicken.com is already the leader in<br/>> online tax preparation and online mortgage origination,\" said Bennett, who<br/>> will relocate from Connecticut to the Bay Area. \"I'm excited to have the<br/>> opportunity to continue developing services for the Internet and take<br/>> Intuit's industry leadership to new heights.\"<br/>> During his GE career, Bennett held significant leadership positions in six<br/>> different businesses within the company, spanning both manufacturing and<br/>> financial services. In his most recent position, he oversaw a portfolio of<br/>> five different companies whose more than 20,000 employees last year<br/>> generated $15 billion in annual volume. Prior to that, as president and<br/>> CEO of GE Capital e-Business, he pioneered the company's efforts to<br/>> leverage the Internet across GE Capital's worldwide portfolio of<br/>> businesses.<br/>> Previously he delivered significant growth as the president and CEO of GE<br/>> Capital's more than 4,000-employee Vendor Financial Services business.<br/>> Under his leadership, assets grew to more than $13 billion from $5 billion<br/>> and net income increased to $200 million from $80 million in four years.<br/>> Intuit board member John Doerr said he was impressed by Bennett's broad<br/>> base of experience. \"Steve knows business-to-business as well as<br/>> business-to-consumer. He knows service businesses. And he gets the Net.<br/>> Intuit's product leadership and Steve's ability to grow businesses are an<br/>> ideal match for our future.\"<br/>> Bennett added, \"Intuit's management team is strong, stable and experienced<br/>> and works well together,\" he said. \"This is one of the few management<br/>> teams to successfully and rapidly transform a company to the Net.

This did<br/>> not<br/>>  surprise us, as you have both been strong partners with us up to<br/>> now.<br/>><br/>>  As we indicated at the beginning, this evaluation was specifically<br/>> aimed at<br/>>  how well each vendor performed at helping us install, develop, test<br/>> and<br/>>  engineer an effective Oracle HA solution.  The ability to work with<br/>> our<br/>>  Intuit team and the strength of the vendors support were critical<br/>> factors.<br/>>  Certainly the difficultly of data migration impacted this project,<br/>> limited<br/>>  our performance testing, and remains of great concern to us in<br/>> considering<br/>>  any migration in the future.<br/>><br/>>  We are taking the opportunity to provide you with our honest<br/>> evaluation in<br/>>  the hopes that this information may be of value to you.  We do<br/>> however<br/>>  consider this information confidential and ask that you do not share<br/>> it<br/>>  outside of your organization.  In addition we are providing it with<br/>> the<br/>>  understanding that you will not use the details contained herein to<br/>>  criticize each other in an effort to promote your own position.<br/>><br/>>  Here is a summary of our evaluation:<br/>><br/>>  Sun Clusters - unacceptable, lacking features and EMC disk support<br/>>  Sun/Veritas Clusters - acceptable, but uncertain support and future<br/>>  HP Clusters - very good, strong features,  strong product roadmap,<br/>> very good<br/>>  technical support,  marginal sales support, variable support during<br/>>  evaluation<br/>>  Compaq - very good, stronger features, strong product roadmap,<br/>> outstanding<br/>>  support, higher risk<br/>><br/>>  It should be understood, that there has not been a final decision<br/>> and<br/>>  management has not approved a migration plan.<br/>><br/>>  We recommended Compaq, provided that we would be able to reduce the<br/>> risk<br/>>  factor associated with the recent release of their current software<br/>> and<br/>>  hardware architectures.<br/>><br/>>  Management has requested that some further analysis be done (which<br/>> were not<br/>>  in the scope of this project) including cost/benefit analysis from<br/>> our<br/>>  customer's viewpoint and conversion cost estimates.  We believe we<br/>> have all<br/>>  the vendor information necessary to complete this analysis though<br/>> they may<br/>>  be a few pricing issues that will need clarification.<br/>><br/>>  We will be in contact with each vendor regarding the disposition of<br/>> the<br/>>  loaned equipment we have on site from each vendor.<br/>><br/>>  We again thank you for your efforts.

The<br/>assignment clause in the GE Terms and Conditions currently permits the<br/>assignment by the buyer to an affiliate without GE's consent. The word<br/>affiliate is not defined but we should be able to take the position, as a<br/>49% equity owner in East Coast Power, that it is an El Paso affiliate.  I<br/>would recommend that to clarify, we include the following clause after the<br/>word affiliate in the Assignment Section: (including but not limited to East<br/>Coast Power L.L.C.).  Andrew, Bob and Coralyn, pls advise if you would like<br/>to take a different approach. I also expect that we will have a credit issue<br/>when the Contract is assigned to ECP as GE is now, I believe, getting an El<br/>Paso Energy Corp. Guaranty. According to Bob Licato at ECP, GE accepted an<br/>ECP assignment without an Enron guaranty on Linden 6 due in part to the<br/>presence of GECC as a lender/equity participant in ECP. We can discuss this<br/>with GE when we inform them of the planned assignment to ECP.  Finally, I<br/>would advise that when we get GE to sign a letter accepting the assignment,<br/>we confirm that the GE warranties flow to ECP.<br/><br/><br/>******************************************************************<br/>This email and any files transmitted with it from El Paso<br/>Energy Corporation are confidential and intended solely<br/>for the use of the individual or entity to whom they are<br/>addressed.

      "-Origin: DASOVICH-J<br/>X-FileName: jdasovic.nsf<br/><br/>Team,<br/>Looks like things are finally coming home to roost here.  I would argue that <br/>we (TW and Enron) should both consider getting our 5-minute sound bite in <br/>here since we're being afforded the opportunity.  Obviously, our goal should <br/>be to see the Commission adopt the Comprehensive Settlement.  Our focus point <br/>during our presentation should be on not only the sufficiency of <br/>infrastructure (not dealt with specfically in the Comprehensive Settlement) <br/>but the idea that there must be a concomitant unbundling of the intrastate <br/>transmission and a rational, equitable means to allocate capacity at receipt <br/>points and an orderly assignment of firm rights to shippers <br/>(primary/secondary).

Then we will take that information and try to match it up with the <br/>list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package.  I'm assuming <br/>that, if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the <br/>TAGG people (meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point, <br/>which it sounds like we did), they were probably not included in the <br/>Wholesale package.  If this is the case, then the deals are not really ours <br/>and are, presumably, CES Retail.  If CES-Retail does not want the deals, then <br/>we will value the transactions, get together and discuss the best way to <br/>handle them (i.e., us or EES), then propose a transfer of the deals to <br/>Enron.  <br/><br/>In summary, if you can get the information noted above to me, I'll take it <br/>from there and find out if the deals have already been assigned to us or <br/>not.

Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES <br/>Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals <br/>stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate <br/>or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for <br/>CES?  This could be a can of worms. <br/><br/>Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production <br/>deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this? <br/>Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES. <br/>Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the <br/>official word.<br/><br/>Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate <br/>delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to <br/>Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the <br/>system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently <br/>the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The <br/>pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to <br/>the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be <br/>increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany <br/>has been creating.<br/><br/>However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot <br/>of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>   <br/> <br/> <br/> From:  Katherine L Kelly @ ECT                           03/13/2000 10:34 AM<br/> <br/><br/>To: Joan Veselack/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Robert Allwein/HOU/ECT@ECT<br/>cc: Wade R Price/HOU/ECT@ECT <br/><br/>Subject: Re: CES Pool Gas<br/><br/>Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are <br/>TCO deals.  I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these <br/>were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that <br/>CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points.  We found a few like <br/>this on CNG last week.  The way we have been handling this is to show a buy <br/>from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.  <br/>Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right <br/>now he's priorities are just a bit different.  I guess why I'm a little <br/>confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the <br/>pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.  <br/><br/>Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal?

MARKETING.DOC: Information for out marketing department, please fill in and <br/>send back as soon as possible<br/><br/>Friday 26th May 2000 : A Hard Copy Of Your Documentation<br/>3 weeks to go!<br/><br/>  ? We would like a hard black & white copy of  your presentation / bullet <br/>points/copy of slides whichever is best for you, to insert into the delegate <br/>documentation. We can receive this by post or email if the documents are not <br/>too complex but we try not to insert fax copies as copy quality is poor. <br/>(e-mail address - ttulsi@icbi.co.uk).<br/><br/>N.B. Even if you plan to speak off the cuff, we would urge that you submit at <br/>least an outline of your speech to us for insertion into the delegate pack by <br/>the above date. The most consistent complaint that we have from delegates is <br/>that not all speakers offer hard copies of their presentation.<br/><br/>  ? If you are unable to make this deadline, please could you inform us as <br/>soon as possible so that we can make alternative arrangements and avoid <br/>printing delay.<br/><br/>Under separate cover we have arranged for five brochures to be sent to you <br/>outlining the full programme.  These should arrive very shortly.<br/><br/>Should you have any queries regarding your participation at the conference <br/>please contact Tanuja Tulsiani, our Logistics  Manager who will be looking <br/>after the 'domestic' side of the event.

      "-Origin: HORTON-S<br/>X-FileName: shorton.nsf<br/><br/>Last week I reported to our Board of Directors that our highest priority <br/>objectives for 2000 <br/>are to continue to substantially improve our safety and environmental record <br/>throughout this <br/>year.  These objectives supersede any and all of our financial objective for <br/>2000. <br/>EOTT 2000 Objectives:<br/>Environmental - Reduce reportable spills and leaks by 50%<br/>Safety - Reduce lost time accidents by 30%<br/><br/>I am pleased to report that our Regional Business Managers, District Managers <br/>and their <br/>teams are working closely with Operations Governance to ensure that those <br/>objectives are met.<br/><br/><mark>Please take time to read the following article:</mark><br/><br/> When pipelines are time bombs<br/> 2 million miles of them deliver potential catastrophe every day<br/><br/>By Patrick McMahon, USA TODAY(Front Page Article 3/14/00<br/> BELLINGHAM, Wash. - Last summer, an underground pipeline ruptured in a city <br/>park here and sent a torrent of gasoline along a wooded streambed toward two <br/>10-year-olds playing with a barbecue lighter.<br/><br/>After the 16-inch pipeline had been hemorrhaging for an hour and 34 minutes, <br/>an explosion sent a fireball racing through the park. A plume of smoke rose <br/>30,000 feet.<br/><br/>Authorities say the blast probably was triggered by a spark from the lighter.<br/><br/>\"There was a spark and the sky turned orange, the boys both told me <br/>afterward,\" says Frank King, whose son, Wade, was one of the boys in the <br/>park. Wade and his friend, Stephen Tsiorvas, were burned over 90% of their <br/>bodies. They died the next day.<br/><br/>Also killed was 18-year-old Liam Wood, who had graduated from high school <br/>five days before. The college-bound Wood was fly-fishing in the park when he <br/>was overcome by fumes, fell into the creek and drowned.<br/><br/>\"To many people, the boys were considered heroes,\" says Mark Asmundson, the <br/>mayor of this seaside city north of Seattle. In sparking the explosion, the <br/>boys kept the most extensive damage confined to the 241-acre park, he says. <br/>\"The river of gasoline was heading right for the center of the city.\" <br/><br/>On Monday, the Senate Commerce Committee held a one-day hearing here, about <br/>five minutes from where the incident occurred, on legislation to improve <br/>safety and government oversight of pipelines and the companies that operate <br/>them. The hearing included gripping, sometimes tearful, testimony from the <br/>boys' parents as well as statements from state and federal officials.<br/><br/>\"My baby died because of inaction. His death was preventable,\" said Katherine <br/>Dalen, Stephen's mother.<br/><br/>More than 2 million miles of iron, steel and plastic pipes - some as large as <br/>5 feet in diameter - snake beneath the earth and deliver oil, gasoline, <br/>natural gas and potential disaster across America every day. They range from <br/>the trans-Alaskan pipeline to tiny pipes carrying natural gas to people's <br/>homes. Safer than gasoline trucks or ocean-going tankers by most measures, <br/>once-remote pipelines are prompting new worries as sprawling metropolitan <br/>areas grow into their paths.<br/><br/>U.S. pipeline accidents have fluctuated in the past 10 years. In the 1990s, <br/>there were 3,917 liquid fuel spills and natural gas leaks, roughly one a day. <br/>The incidents, most involving local lines carrying natural gas, resulted in <br/>201 deaths, 2,826 injuries and $778 million in property damage from 1990 <br/>through 1999.<br/><br/>There also are environmental costs. In January, one of the nation's largest <br/>pipeline companies, Koch Industries of Wichita, Kan., paid a $30 million <br/>civil fine to settle Environmental Protection Agency water-pollution charges <br/>involving 300 oil spills from 1990 to 1997. The EPA said Koch failed to <br/>inspect its pipelines and waited for leaks before making repairs.<br/><br/>Liam Wood's mother, Marlene Robinson, is focused on stronger regulations <br/>nationwide, including more and better inspections, and regional watchdog <br/>committees. <br/><br/>\"I don't have any children left to protect,\" she said in an interview and <br/>repeated at the hearing. \"This didn't have to happen to Liam, and it doesn't <br/>have to happen to other people's children.\"<br/><br/>Although the cause of the Bellingham incident remains under investigation, <br/>one factor might have been damage to the pipeline from a backhoe when a water <br/>line was being installed in 1995. But investigators also have many questions <br/>about the role of Olympic Pipeline Co., which operates a network of pipelines <br/>along a 299-mile corridor from north of Bellingham to Portland, Ore.<br/><br/>Investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) want to <br/>know whether Olympic ignored warning signs and whether it could have acted <br/>more swiftly after the leak. But the inquiry has been delayed by a parallel <br/>investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office. Several Olympic employees have <br/>declined to testify and have invoked their constitutional rights against <br/>self-incrimination. <br/><br/>Pipeline owners and government regulators defend the safety of transporting <br/>two-thirds of the nation's fuels by pipeline, and they warn that more rules <br/>could boost energy prices. Critics say pipelines are too loosely regulated, <br/>not fully inspected and, in some cases, deteriorating.<br/><br/>The U.S. Transportation Department oversees pipelines. Its Office of Pipeline <br/>Safety sets standards for design, operation, maintenance and emergency <br/>response. Richard Felder, who heads the office, testified at Monday's <br/>hearing. \"Our goal is to prevent incidents like Bellingham from ever <br/>happening again,\" he said.<br/><br/>In an earlier interview, he defended his office's performance and the <br/>industry: \"It's a good record. It's the safest form of transporting fuel, far <br/>and away.\"<br/><br/>The office has extensive rules on pipeline safety, including requirements for <br/>signs along the route and programs to alert potential diggers, but \"there's <br/>no such thing as risk elimination,\" Felder says. \"All you can do is manage <br/>it.\" <br/><br/>But the chairman of the federal government's transportation safety watchdog <br/>agency is unimpressed with Felder's office and says it deserves a grade of F. <br/>\"It's been the most frustrating area I've had to deal with as chairman,\" says <br/>Jim Hall, NTSB chairman since 1994. He says no agency has a worse record of <br/>responding to NTSB recommendations.<br/><br/>In a recent speech, he said there's no indication that the Office of Pipeline <br/>Safety \"is in charge or that its regulations, its inspections, its assets, <br/>its staffing and its spirit are adequate to the task.\" <br/><br/>Felder takes issue with much of the criticism, but he endorses calls for more <br/>research into pipeline safety. He said his office is in the final stages of <br/>preparing new safety standards for heavily populated and environmentally <br/>sensitive areas.<br/><br/>He emphasized that the leading cause of pipeline failure is \"third-party <br/>damage\" from road, utility and construction work. The agency has worked to <br/>enhance a system to alert pipeline companies of digging with one telephone <br/>call.<br/><br/>Felder is critical of local authorities who ignore pipelines when making <br/>decisions on housing and commercial development. \"Local planning has not kept <br/>people away from pipelines,\" he says. \"It's astounding to me.\"<br/><br/>Felder bristles at critics' suggestions that his agency is a tool of the oil <br/>and gas industry. \"I can't agree with that one iota,\" he says. \"We try to <br/>balance the safety issue and the economic issue.\"<br/><br/>The Senate Commerce Committee will consider a bipartisan bill sponsored by <br/>Sens. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Slade Gorton, R-Wash.; Rep. Jack Metcalf, <br/>the Republican who represents Bellingham; and Rep. Jay Inslee, a Democrat <br/>whose district includes an operating section of the pipeline. <br/><br/>The bill would require periodic internal inspections of pipelines, boost <br/>federal spending on research, increase the number of federal pipeline <br/>inspectors nationwide - there now are 55 - and expand states' regulatory <br/>authority. On Monday, the Office of Pipeline Safety gave the state of <br/>Washington the temporary right to do more inspections.<br/><br/>The Murray-Gorton bill also would require federal certification of pipeline <br/>workers and expand the public's right to know about spills and leaks. <br/><br/>\"I was totally shocked and amazed when this happened,\" Murray says. \"You <br/>always assume that your neighborhood is safe and somebody has taken care of <br/>this.\"<br/><br/>The Bellingham rupture not only dumped 278,000 gallons of gasoline into this <br/>city of 63,000 near the Canadian border but also unleashed civic furor at <br/>Olympic Pipeline. \"It's hard for people to get interested in things they <br/>can't see. Out of sight is out of mind,\" Mayor Asmundson says. He has visited <br/>the boys' grieving families and lobbied Congress. The blast \"has dominated my <br/>life since June 10.\"<br/><br/>Pipeline operators portray accidents as isolated to escape national scrutiny, <br/>he says. \"The whole focus of the industry is containment. Do whatever you <br/>have to do locally, but don't stir things up nationally.\"<br/><br/>Last week, Murray released a report she requested from the Transportation <br/>Department's inspector general. It faults the Office of Pipeline Safety for <br/>ignoring enhanced safety requirements, including increased inspections inside <br/>pipes, in highly populated and environmentally sensitive areas as Congress <br/>required in 1992 and 1996. <br/><br/>A U.S. General Accounting Office audit of operations is due in May. Also <br/>pending is a decision from Felder and the pipeline safety office on whether <br/>to restart the 39-mile section shut down since the Bellingham accident. <br/>Olympic Pipeline has repaired the line and is eager to reopen it.<br/><br/>People living along the route and officials are pushing for more extensive <br/>testing of the still-operating section of the line south of Bellingham. <br/>Felder says he has not decided whether it should be shut down. <br/><br/>Last week, Felder's office ordered a new round of testing along the entire <br/>line, but critics such as Inslee are not convinced it will be enough. The <br/>tests must be conducted on the closed section of the pipeline before a <br/>decision is made on reopening it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n",

By the way, this <br/>is also the day on which the parties must mutually agree on 5 leading dealers <br/>in the relevant market in case the valuation process in (3) below is later <br/>disputed by the other party.<br/><br/>(3)  The party giving notice determines (in good faith) the Cash Settlement <br/>Amount as of 11 a.m. NY time on the Break Date (which should be the <br/>mid-market value of the deal on the Break Date.<br/><br/>(4)  Payment will occur on the Break Date.<br/><br/>(5)  I am adding a provision requiring the exercising party to notify the <br/>other party on the day that is 3 NY Business Days prior to the Break Date.  <br/>There may be a dispute over the calculation and the parties will need to <br/>resolve.<br/><br/>(6)  If the parties cannot agree on the Cash Settlement Amount calculation, <br/>then the party who gave notice seeks mid-market quotes from the 5 leading <br/>dealers (previously agreed to) at 11 a.m. on the day that is 2 NY Business <br/>Days before the Break Date.  The confirm describes how the quotes are <br/>averaged.  A minimum of 3 quotes is essential.

Please note that:<br/><br/> (a)  the second paragraph purports to incorporate the 1991 ISDA Definitions <br/>but the master overrides this language because it incorporates the 1991 <br/>Definitions \"as amended, modified, superceded or replaced from time to time\" <br/>(i.e., the 2000 ISDA Definitions).  There is a problem if  WestLB disagrees <br/>because I've left some language in Paragraph 3 \"as is\" since it is based upon <br/>the 2000 ISDA Definitions. <br/><br/> (b)  no need to say that the Calculation Agent is \"as otherwise stated in <br/>the Agreement\" because WestLB is stated to be the Calculation Agent in the <br/>Agreement.<br/><br/><br/>Sara Shackleton<br/>Enron North America Corp.<br/>1400 Smith Street, EB 3801a<br/>Houston, Texas  77002<br/>713-853-5620 (phone)<br/>713-646-3490 (fax)<br/>sara.shackleton@enron.com\n",

Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.<br/><br/>The main areas to focus on over the next week are:- <br/><br/>(i)     Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)                               To be forwarded to Louise       <br/>        These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  <br/><br/>        The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.     <br/>(ii)    Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)                                                To be forwarded to Faith Killen <br/>        First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) <br/>(iii)   Seating Plans                                                           Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate <br/>        We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.<br/><br/>        I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.<br/><br/>(iv)    Due Diligence <br/>        We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.<br/><br/>I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.<br/><br/>Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.<br/><br/>If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out. <br/><br/>Happy New Year <br/><br/>Louise \n",

      "About a month ago I held a  meeting in Houston to bring together the systems, operations, and commercial people who were responsible for designing and building our wholesale and retail systems.  There were probably twenty people there, including Beth Perlman, Anthony Dayao, Beth Appollo, Bob Hall, Leslie Reeves, Lloyd Will, Todd Busby, Greg Woulfe, Rogers Herndon, Murray O'Neil, Steve Nat, Jeff Richter, Thresa Allen, Pablo ?, Mark Pickering, Dale Furrow, and many more.  <br/><br/>Two of my suspicions were confirmed in this meeting.  First, it was clear that there were a bunch of people working in silos.  Beth's group was just starting to talk to Anthony's group.  The site profile team wasn't on the same page as Richter who wasn't necessarily in sync with Herndon.  EES and ENA (and for that matter east ENA and west ENA) volume management and RTO settlements people weren't talking to one another.  Second, it was clear that nobody had tried to map out what all of the necessary functions are and how they should fit together.  We tasked Todd Busby, Debra Bailey, and Lloyd Will to spend a month talking to each group and \"drawing the picture\" of all of the systems that were being worked on and how they should fit together.  They brought in a couple of people from Accenture to assist with this project.<br/><br/>The powerpoint presentation below documents their findings.  I would encourage you to look at pages 11 through 15 which summarize the issues and recommendations.  Here are the highlights:<br/>Power IT and operations remain organizationally divided between Wholesale and Retail<br/>Settlements development efforts are not global<br/>Create one power IT & one operations organization for retail and wholesale power<br/>Create power program management team to coordinate business requirements for trading, risk, settlements & volume mngt across wholesale and retail desks<br/><br/>Our systems and operations efforts are in chaos right now in terms of getting prepared for the future of wholesale and retail power.  If you think about how decisions and priorities are established you have a half dozen commercial people (me, Richter, Presto, Will, Herndon, Woulfe, ...) working with a few operations people (White, Appollo, Albrecht, O'Neil, Hall) and a handful of systems people (Dayao, Nat, Stock, Perlman) to come up with a plan.  It just isn't working.  We need a structure and we need it fast.  Chaos is expensive and ineffective.<br/><br/>Here's what I want:<br/>One Operations Person Responsible for Wholesale and Retail Power<br/>One Systems Person Responsible for Wholesale and Retail Power<br/>One Commercial Person Responsible for Overseeing All Wholesale and Retail Power Systems Development<br/>One Project Manager Working for the Commercial Person to Coordinate and Run Herd Over These Efforts.<br/><br/>There are a number of variants of what I want that could work.  We need to get this thing figured out ASAP.  <mark>Please advise on how you recommend moving forward.</mark><br/><br/> -----Original Message-----<br/>From:  Bailey, Debra  <br/>Sent: Tuesday, November 06, 2001 10:05 AM<br/>To: Belden, Tim<br/>Cc: Will, Lloyd; Busby, Todd; Richter, Jeff<br/>Subject: version 5 - small tweaks only (not required)<br/><br/>Tim,<br/><br/>I made the following changes to the presentation which are not required for your distribution if you have already sent it out:<br/><br/>1.  page 10 first bullet - changed \"one power and operations organization\" to \"one power and one operations organization\" .<br/><br/>2.  page 11 - modified colors to clarify point <br/><br/><br/>Debra<br/><br/> \n",

      "  Owners of Generation Within the State of California:<br/>  On February 8, 2001, the Honorable Gray Davis, Governor of<br/>the State of California, issued Executive Order D-23-01.  For your<br/>reference, an Internet link to a copy of D-23-01 can be found on the<br/>California Independent System Operator (ISO) homepage (www.caiso.com)<br/><http://www.caiso.com)> .  In that Executive Order, the ISO is directed to<br/>require generators to submit their outage schedules to the ISO.  With those<br/>schedules, the ISO is charged with preparing a coordinated generator outage<br/>plan, and updating it quarterly.<br/>  At the Stakeholder Meeting co-hosted by the ISO and the<br/>Electricity Oversight Board on March 1, 2001, stakeholders expressed great<br/>interest in the process which would ultimately be used by the ISO to meet<br/>the needs of Executive Order D-23-01.  As we receive input from stakeholders<br/>on their concerns in developing the outage coordination process relative to<br/>D-23-01,  we will address those concerns and share the formal outage<br/>coordination procedure when it is available.  Meanwhile, it is critical to<br/>gather outage information to:<br/>1. meet the immediate needs of D-23-01 while more extensive procedures<br/>are being developed for the ultimate coordination process;<br/>2. gain a better understanding of the potential scope of the<br/>coordinated plan as described in D-23-01; and<br/>3. offer to the EOB (as soon in the development process as possible) a<br/>\"work-in-progress\" for their comment relative to meeting the needs of<br/>D-23-01.<br/>  <mark>Accordingly, if you have not already done so, please forward</mark><br/>your existing generator outage plans to the ISO by April 1, 2001.  The<br/>initial report should cover your outage plans from now through December 31,<br/>2001.  Further, in order to permit the ISO to prepare a quarterly state-wide<br/>generator outage plan in accordance with D-23-01, we also ask that you<br/>forward to the ISO by the fifteenth day of each subsequent quarter, starting<br/>on April 15, 2001, your planned outages for the following twelve months.  In<br/>this way, we can prepare a \"rolling\" twelve-month outage plan as ordered by<br/>D-23-01.  Finally, we ask that you notify the ISO of any subsequent changes<br/>to your latest quarterly submission.<br/>  Until further notice, please forward your Twelve-Month<br/>Generator Outage Plans and updates electronically as a Microsoft Excel file<br/>or other compatible spreadsheet attached to an e-mail addressed to<br/>outage.folsom@caiso.com <mailto:outage.folsom@caiso.com>  with \"Generator<br/>Twelve-Month Outage Plan\" in the subject line. Each planned outage or<br/>curtailment should include the following information:<br/>  Generator Outage Information<br/>* Resource/Unit Name and Number, as applicable (e.g., Alamitos Unit 2)<br/>* Location (city or county)<br/>* Scheduling Coordinator (as applicable)<br/>* Owner<br/>* Unit Maximum MW (i.e., without curtailment)<br/>* MW available during outage<br/>* MW unavailable during outage<br/>* Equipment out of service (if entire unit, indicate \"Unit Out of<br/>Service\", if only a partial curtailment, note equipment out of service<br/>causing most restrictive curtailment)<br/>* Cause (note the work being done)<br/>* Date and time scheduled out of service or unavailable for service<br/>* Date and time schedule to return to service or available for service<br/>* Time required for emergency return to service if different from<br/>scheduled return<br/>* Contact person, phone number, and e-mail address<br/>  The ISO plans to transition toward a \"web-based\" submittal<br/>system compatible with the ISO Database Logging system known as SLIC.  We<br/>will advise you when the method for submittal of outage information changes.<br/><br/>  The ISO appreciates very much your cooperation in this<br/>effort.  Should you have any questions, please contact me by e-mail<br/>(gvanpelt@caiso.com) <mailto:gvanpelt@caiso.com)> .<br/>  Thank you,<br/>  Gregory Van Pelt<br/>  Manager of Outage Coordination<br/>  California Independent System Operator\n",

      "-Origin: FISCHER-M<br/>X-FileName: mark fischer 7-12-02 LNotes.nsf<br/><br/>Tom/Kevin,<br/><br/>In the development of the 1.5 MW WTG Statistical Process Control (SPC) <br/>reporting tool we have some additional questions regarding the data which <br/>comes to us from VisuPro.   In the attached spreadsheet you will find a <br/>listing of most of the channels which VisuPro uses to record data.  With some <br/>exceptions, each channel should correspond to a transducer on the turbine.  <br/>The channel name and number can be found in the left columns as they are <br/>presented in VisuPro.  The \"Alias\" column is my attempt to better understand <br/>the channel and put a more meaningful label on the channel for presentation <br/>to the field personnel.  Wherever there is a blank it means that I do not <br/>have a good explanation of the channel and need more information.  <br/><br/>You can ignore the grey shading.  It is just an indicator as to whether the <br/>particular channel is currently included in the existing version of our SPC <br/>analytic.  The more interesting column is the \"Include\" column which is our <br/>future plan regarding inclusion of the particular channel in the next <br/>revision of the analytic.<br/><br/><mark>Please do provide comments regarding simplified label names.</mark>  Also please <br/>note that I need further clarification on cells with comments inserted (look <br/>for the red traingle in the top right corner of 3 of the cells).<br/><br/>The other thing I would really like to have is a picture, or drawing, of the <br/>exact location of each of the transducers we are planning on including.

The attached documents, including the agenda, a memo on the Bridge<br/>agreement, and a copy of the Bridge agreement, were reviewed at this<br/>morning's meeting. <br/><br/>Much of the discussion focused on explanation of the Bridge Agreement. There<br/>was some discussion about the German regulatory structure and the bridge<br/>agreement.  Katia ran through the agenda in Houston and asked for ideas on<br/>December conference.  I was not able to hear all of the questions entirely<br/>but questions were asked about the outcome of the meeting.  Katia and<br/>Christophe explained that it was a forum to exchange ideas and to promote<br/>use of ISDA within industry. The minutes should give us more detail.  <br/><br/>In addition to a call re: the NA agenda, I think it would be worthwhile to<br/>also have a call w/Christophe, Katia and John Berry to discuss European<br/>activities and to begin discussion on the December agenda.

      "-Origin: Whalley-L<br/>X-FileName: gwhalley.nsf<br/><br/>Guys--<br/><br/>First of all, Louise, I understand we have a baby??  CONGRATULATIONS!! <br/>(details please, at your earliest chance)<br/><br/>Regarding the Wharton e-Business Initiative (see below for one of the many <br/>eMails I've received concerning Enron's participation--link to the referenced <br/>web site for specific agenda; also, I've received several voice messages from <br/>leaders of the effort).  The information below discusses one of the  forums <br/>(coming up 5/31-6/1) that comprise an on-going e-business initiative in which <br/>Enron has invested with Wharton.<br/><br/> The participants from Wharton include senior level professors; while there <br/>may be some student involvement, the intentional focus is high level <br/>discussion and research endeavors at the professorial level.  <br/>Other participants in WeBI are Corporate representatives.  The idea is for <br/>the professors to offer their latest research issues, promote discussions <br/>among the corporate participants to talk through the professors research and <br/>other research in the literature, as well as for the professors to listen for <br/>new areas for which commercial eBusinesses are seeking new research.<br/><br/>Again,  this is intentionally designed as a High Level Professor <br/>participation on the Wharton side, and high level e-Business Corporate <br/>executives on the other side. This is intentionally designed to create a <br/>high-level 'e-think-tank' environment for senior level professors and <br/>corporate executives.<br/><br/>O.K.....have I labored enough to describe what WeBI is all about??<br/><br/>As opposed to the several other efforts Enron University Affairs has to <br/>DIRECTLY increase Enron's favorability and familiarity on campus at levels <br/>above recruiting, but that ultimately trickle down to recruiting, this is <br/>intentionally a research/discussion effort. Clearly, the Enron Brand equity <br/>in dealing with professors is that the professors ultimately incorporate work <br/>from information from the participatory forums into their class teachings, <br/>references, course work, etc. <br/><br/>A few weeks ago, Louise and I breifly chatted about Enron's involvement in <br/>this effort.  Clearly, there is a HUGE interest by the Wharton professors and <br/>other corporate participants involved to have Enron attend and <br/><mark>participate---they quite respectfully call me and eMail me very</mark> <br/>frequently.......All of this is very interesting to me and I have shepherded <br/>our minimal involvement-in-fact........ yet the question remains:  is there <br/>someone at Enron, directly involved in Enron's eBusiness initiatives, <br/>interested in jumping into this effort and participating?  Do those of you <br/>involved in these businesses think it worth your time and expense, or the <br/>time and expense of one of your senior (at least Director level) people to <br/>participate?  Would it be viewed, at least at this time,  simply as an \"Enron <br/>brain drain\" (I've received this realistic and possibly quite legitimate <br/>concern from more than one business person at Enron).   <br/><br/>The bottom line is, I'd like to be able to respond intelligently and honestly <br/>to those at Wharton committed to this effort.  I feel more than comfortable <br/>telling Wharton that, at this time, Enron is satisfied to participate in the <br/>WeBI effort largely at the <br/>financial level it has already invested--with the option to participate at <br/>other levels in the future, at Enron's discretion.<br/><br/>ALL comments solicited----<br/><br/>Many thanks!!<br/><br/>--Christie.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>---------------------- Forwarded by Christie Patrick/HOU/ECT on 05/21/2001 <br/>04:02 PM ---------------------------<br/><br/><br/>HartleyR <HartleyR@wharton.upenn.edu> on 05/21/2001 03:03:44 PM<br/>To: \"'Christie_Patrick@enron.com'\" <Christie_Patrick@enron.com><br/>cc:  <br/><br/>Subject: ICG/Wharton Forum meeting May 31-June 1<br/><br/><br/>Christie,<br/><br/>Lee Goldring, our new Forum director mentioned that he placed a call to you<br/>to introduce himself and follow up on Enron's representation at the next<br/>meeting.

Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.<br/><br/>Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.<br/><br/>The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  <mark>Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.</mark><br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Peter Streicher\n",

Could you please make every effort to get with Amy Baird <br/>to resolve those two legal issues from her Oct 13th memo (items 3&4).  <br/>Regarding Item 2 we agreed to a $1mm cap for the entire contract term.    <br/>Also, the contract does not address any of the pricing terms of the deal.  <br/>I'm assuming that this would be covered in the confirmation rather than the <br/><mark>base of the contract   Could you please send a draft of the confirmation to</mark> <br/>Mike Cesario by tomorrow morning.  <br/>I've sent you a copy of my proposal so you know the terms.  There's a few <br/>additional items that need to be included.<br/>Please DO NOT include the pricing (NYMEX + .055) .  That's still being <br/>negotiated.<br/><br/>1.  Enron will warrant that we will have 15,000 of FT on Koch<br/>2. Ormet pays the demand charge ($.05) on the transport on any volumes below <br/>15,000/d<br/>3.  Volumes above 15,000/d up to 22/d will be supplied on IT.  We will <br/>utilize the same receipt/delivery path as the FT volumes in order to get the <br/>discounted transport rate.  If Koch cuts our IT, we will use best efforts to <br/>get the gas there on another path or on Cypress.  We will pass thru the <br/>actual transport costs if they are above the discounted FT rate.<br/>4.  Ormet must supply us with accurate and timely consumption information<br/><br/>5.   If Koch declares Force Majeure on our FT,  we must use best efforts to <br/>get gas and transport on Cypress before we declare FM<br/><br/>6. This is a full requirements contract (we supply all the gas that they <br/>consume)<br/>7.  If Koch's tariff changes and they go away from monthly balancing, then we <br/>will have a price re-opener.<br/>8.

I hope we don't=<br/> need. =20<br/><br/><br/>Events of June 3<br/><br/>Gas service to the plant has been challenging.  Lonestar Pipeline is runnin=<br/>g a pig for June 4,5,&6.  Lonestar told us that roughly 60% would be cut. A=<br/>pparently Friday, May 31, Kevin communicated to his scheduling counterparti=<br/>es the maintenance information.  He also indicated that our Lonestar=09rep =<br/>said the only safe scheduling points for the gas to come into their system =<br/>was Lonestar-Carthage and Lonestar-Katy Plant.  Neither of the plant's supp=<br/>liers -Apache/Cinergy or Williams provided gas at those points for gas day =<br/>June 4.   Cuts did occur as we were warned.  Of the total nomination of 45M=<br/>M, 17.1 MM flowed for today's gas flow.  The supplier breakout is Apache/Ci=<br/>nergy -20MM and  Williams-25MM.   Yesterday, Jeff Smiron at Lonestar said t=<br/>hey would allow the plant to pull from their imbalance account for today's =<br/>flow but they we had to have flowing gas for June 5 & 6.=20<br/><br/>I communicated the situation to Mike Mazowita at White Pines on June 3.  I =<br/>also inquired about alternative fuel capability as a back-up.  The plant ca=<br/>n burn No.6 low sulfur fuel oil.  Mike indicated that the plant would not w=<br/>ant to do that and hadn't burned oil in quite some time.  I told Mike that =<br/>I would use the possibility of alternative fuel replacement costs as levera=<br/>ge with the suppliers.  He inquired if I knew how Lonestar would cut back t=<br/>he plant.  I told him that I =09wasn't familiar with Lonestar specifically =<br/>but based on my experiences in gas control from a previous life that for a =<br/>plant of it's size they probably have remote control capabilities.  If not =<br/>they would sent a field worker out to the meter station to adjust the valve=<br/>.<br/><br/>The Apache and Williams supply contracts mirror each other in language.  Th=<br/>e way I interrupt the contract language is that the supplier has the right =<br/>to choose the supply point/points into Lonestar's system from a list of pri=<br/>mary or secondary points in Exhibit A.  If the plant's transportation contr=<br/>act gets interrupted then the supplier has the obligation to deliver gas in=<br/>to Lonestar's system at a location that will flow on the plant's transporta=<br/>tion agreement.  If the supplier shorts theplant then the supplier is oblig=<br/>ated to pay for replacement costs for either gas or alternate fuels.  Yeste=<br/>rday, I communicated my interpretation of the agreements to Frank Fields at=<br/> Williams and to Michelle Morgan and her boss Tom Strickland at Cinergy.  T=<br/>om indicated that there had been an amendment and I told him I didn't have =<br/>a copy of the amendment.   Sounds like the amendment may have changed some =<br/>of the delivery points.  I told Tom at Cinergy that =09my primary concern w=<br/>as flowing gas supply to the plant.  Tom was suggesting that this may be a =<br/>force majuere event.  I told him I didn't interpret=09the force majuere lan=<br/>guage that way.  The force majuere language addresses freeze-offs and line =<br/>breaks but not maintenance.  I also told him that the contract has a provis=<br/>ion for transportation interruption. =20<br/><br/>In any case I told Tom time was of the essence and I was focusing on the op=<br/>erational issues and not monetary issues.  I told him we could address the =<br/>=09financial resolution per the contract after the event was over.  I told =<br/>him that the financial resolution of replacement gas for three days was min=<br/>imal in comparison to any potential damages incurred by the plant due to th=<br/>e pipe cutting back their gas supply.=20<br/><br/>   =20<br/>Events of June 4<br/><br/>This morning I spoke with Michelle Morgan at Cinergy.  They are supplying 1=<br/>2.9MM at Aquila-Katy into Lonestar for June 5.  Williams is buying 10MM at =<br/>Carthage and 5MM at HLPL for June 5.  Per Lonestar this should be OK for Ju=<br/>ne 5.  Michelle had said she would pay back the shorted volume from June 4 =<br/>after the pigging was completed.  They will  pay back the volume ratably fo=<br/>r the remainder or in a day. =20<br/><br/>Russ Brown at Lonestar contacted Kevin around 12:30 to say the plant needed=<br/> to cut back to the 17.1MM flowing gas volume for today.  The plant's burn =<br/>rate was causing the pig to run to fast.  Russ is the manager of the transp=<br/>ortation administration department at Lonestar.  I called Russ back at 1:10=<br/>pm to inquire about the problem.  I asked him to call gas control and see w=<br/>hen the pig run would be over and to see if there was a point that we could=<br/> bring gas in intraday to help alleviate the problem.   I also called Mike =<br/>to inform him of the new events.  Russ called back and said the run would b=<br/>e over at 12:00pm tonight and that the only interconnect location that coul=<br/>d help was El Paso Field Services-Ennis.  He also indicated that the pressu=<br/>re had stabilized and the plant may be able<br/>to make it through the run without the incremental gas.  I called Cinergy a=<br/>nd Williams to see if they could make gas available intraday at the point. =<br/> Frank at Williams said they could not and Michelle at Cinergy said she wou=<br/>ld let me know.  At 3:30 Michelle indicated that they could buy the gas and=<br/> the cost would be $0.95 to $1.00 more than the contract price.  She said t=<br/>hat they didn't think Apache was liable for the costs because the requested=<br/> meter is not on the delivery point lists in the contract.  They would buy =<br/>the gas if we would agree to pay the price.  I called Mike at White Pines a=<br/>nd ask him what he wanted to do.  He indicated that he wanted us me to buy =<br/>the gas.  I called Russ to get an update and see if we could still do the n=<br/>om.  Russ said the plant was burning more.  Now they were burning 48MM and =<br/>requested they cut back to their nominated volume of 45MM.  I told Russ I d=<br/>idn't think that they could be I would call.  Mike confirmed that they coul=<br/>d not.  He said had already called Brazos to see if they could back off eve=<br/>n 20 to 30 MW.  He said Brazos is \"playing chicken\" and are requesting ever=<br/>ything they have.   I told him I would call Cinergy and see if I could get =<br/>them to nominate the gas and agreed to settle the financial side per the co=<br/>ntract after the pigging event is completed.  I called Michelle with my pro=<br/>posal and she said she needed to talk to Apache and would call me back.  We=<br/> agreed to nominate the intraday gas and work out the financial part after =<br/>the event was over.  Michelle called back and said the gas was going to com=<br/>e from storage and due to pressure problems the gas could not be delivered.=<br/> =20<br/><br/>Events of June 5<br/><br/>The plant made it through the June 4 gas day on gas.  I spoke with Michelle=<br/> and she indicated that they were planning on serving gas day June 6 the sa=<br/>me as June 5.  She said that Apache didn't think they were liable to make u=<br/>p the gas they shorted us for June 4.  She said I could talk with Pat Green=<br/> at Apache regarding the issue.  Williams moved their gas from Carthage to =<br/>HPL for June 6.  I left a message for Russ at Lonestar to check on the poin=<br/>t.  I requested that =09Kevin do the same with his Lonestar contact.  Neith=<br/>er of us has had a return call from our corresponding Lonestar counterparti=<br/>es.  We will have to address the =09issue intraday if necessary.<br/>=09<br/>I will keep everyone posted of any new developments.<br/><br/>\n",

The project is due to <br/>complete in June 01 and Dave and my concern is whether we can make sure they <br/>are motivated to close on time and get the best possible price for us. Dave <br/>believe the up side could be as much as $150mm and the downside as much as <br/>$300mm (the difference between best and worst prices/sales).<br/><br/>My suggestion is that we do the following and I would like your comments or <br/>concerns if any:<br/><br/>Enter into contracts or an agreement (the later would be one way - us to them <br/>and obviously easier) with each of them outlining the following:<br/><br/>Bonus targets based on financial targets and PRC performance for calendar 01 <br/>(ie if you rank in top 3 categories and you realise over $650 from this <br/>project we will pay you not less than $300k)<br/><br/>Equity award on closing, on the basis of successful closure and above line <br/>value (ie only in the event that this closes in June 01 and realises more <br/>than $650mm we will grant you $200k in options, if above $800m then $350k in <br/>options.)<br/><br/>Dave would like for me to get back to him on this asap.<br/><br/>David<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n",

Project  <br/><br/>As you are aware, Transwestern is working with a shipper to potentially <br/>provide service to a new power plant located approximately 40 miles off the <br/>mainline in Arizona.  Although, the final negotiation are not complete <br/>certain options are being evaluated, I need some assistance in interpreting <br/>the regulations regarding the authority we should use for approval of this <br/>project.  <br/><br/>The facilities that would be constructed include a delivery point and <br/>approximately 40 miles of pipe.  As these facilities are non-mainline, it may <br/>be possible to construct the proposed facilities under the prior notice <br/>provisions of TW's blanket certificate, provided the project satisfies the <br/>blanket criteria (generally costs and environmental).<br/><br/>With this in mind, I have the following issues and questions:<br/><br/>Preliminarily, marketing is thinking that we may want to develop an <br/>incremental rate  to recover the cost of the project.<br/><br/>Would a new incremental rate for this service impact our ability to file for <br/>approval under the prior notice provisions?  Note: Generally, Subpart F of <br/>Part 157 (blanket regulations) does not address service issues as <br/>transportation service is provided under Part 284 of the Commission's <br/>regulations.  However, the regulations (o157.204)  set forth Who may apply <br/>for a blanket certificate.   The criteria includes, among other things, any <br/>interstate pipeline that has rates accepted by the Commission.  Therefore, <br/>would an incremental rate have to be approved by the Commission before the <br/>proposed facilities would be blanket eligible?<br/><br/>Can a new incremental rate be established through a limit-section 4 rate <br/>filing or is a case-specific certificate required?<br/><br/>As the facilities will not include any mainline expansion - Is an open season <br/>required for the project?  My opinion is \"NO\".  Do you agree?<br/><br/>Your thoughts and assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated.  <br/>Thanks MW<br/>\n",

All of this is post closing.  They are <br/>putting up a full blown parent guaranty to GE for the turbine contract, and <br/>since the payment should only be around $4mm, that would probably be <br/>acceptable to GE.  <br/><br/>Keffer et al will issue revised documents tonight.

It's located <br/>within walking distance of the  falls on the Brazil side and set inside the <br/>national reserve forrest with all  kinds of walking trails.? They might offer <br/>a service to get to the  Argentina side of the falls, I'll check into that.? <br/>If not you just take a  taxi or car service.? <br/>??? When we went we stayed at  Mabu which had all of these thermal swimming <br/>pools, large grounds, pond  etc.? It was more for the kids to enjoy.? Our <br/>kids liked the falls but  after walking on one side of it had no interest for <br/>the other.........too much  walking.? It would be a nice get-away for the two <br/>of you I  think.<br/>??? I'll check into flights and  hotels today and let you know what I find <br/>out.? I haven't heard much about  Hotel Conial Igua?a, I'll see what I can <br/>find on it here.<br/>??? I'll be in touch  soon..Jan<br/>PS? Let Renato know that just finished  having a workout room built at the <br/>house.? Also, he can enjoy some great  running in front of the beach while <br/>you're in Rio --?? so hopefully he  won't suffer too much withdrawal <br/>!.................have a good  one<br/><br/>\n",

      "-Origin: Whitt-M<br/>X-FileName: MWHITT (Non-Privileged).pst<br/><br/>ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their \"angle\" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  <br/><br/>As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.<br/><br/>There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this \"retail\" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.<br/><br/>These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:<br/><br/>1.  Power Marketing and Project development<br/>2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access<br/>3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise<br/><br/>Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.<br/><br/>Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.<br/><br/><mark>Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.</mark>  I don't want to make this email a novel!<br/><br/>Thanks a lot.<br/><br/>303-575-6473\n",

Each of the individuals from Industry Canada may enter into conversations <br/>with you, ask you questions about our business or your business, ask you to <br/>provide information, documentation, etc.  In this regard, Enron Canada <br/>Corp.'s interests are represented by the law firm of Blake, Cassels & <br/>Graydon.  Each member of Industry Canada has assigned to it a representative <br/>of the firm of Blake, Cassels & Graydon, under the supervision of Dalton <br/>McGrath, who is a partner with his firm.  You are not speak to or provide any <br/>such information to any of the representatives of Industry Canada except <br/>under the authority and direction of a representative of Blake, Cassels & <br/>Graydon.  In other words, you are to advise the representatives of Industry <br/>Canada that you need to seek the advice and instructions of counsel before <br/>speaking with them or providing any information.<br/><br/>2. Although it is business as usual, as is the case whenever we have any <br/>outside visitors in the office, it is important to maintain the <br/>confidentiality of your business and your information.  In other words, the <br/>representatives of Industry Canada are here for a specified purpose and they <br/>should be treated no differently than any other third parties when you are <br/>discussing, negotiating or documenting transactions that do not concern them.<br/><br/>3. It is Enron Canada Corp.'s intention to be cooperative and <br/>non-obstructive.  At the same time, it is both appropriate and customary that <br/>we do not assist the representatives of Industry Canada in doing their jobs.  <br/>In other words, they know what they are looking for, and it is appropriate <br/>and customary for us not to point them in any particular direction, which may <br/>be the right or wrong direction.  Again, documentation and information <br/>requests are to be handled directly through Blake, Cassels & Graydon under <br/>the supervision of Dalton McGrath.<br/><br/>4. If the representatives of Industry Canada take any information (whether in <br/>physical, electronic or other form) it is imperative that through a <br/>representative of Blake, Cassels & Graydon that information is inventoried, <br/>and please ensure that this is the case.  All such information will be <br/>subject to a legal privilege and therefore it is important to specifically <br/>identify any information requested or acquired.<br/><br/>5. Although this matter may come out in the public domain, either <br/>intentionally or unintentionally, it is imperative that this matter not <br/>become in the public domain through any act or omission of an Enron Canada <br/>Corp. employee.  It is a duty of your employment, consistent with any other <br/>matter affecting your employment, that this matter be kept strictly <br/>confidential and within the confines of Enron Canada Corp. (i.e. not to be <br/>discussed with your counterparts in Houston) on a need to know basis.  This <br/>includes, particularly with representatives of Industry Canada in the office, <br/>that this matter is not the subject of gossip or \"coffee talk\".  <br/><br/>6. If you receive a request to discuss this matter through the media or other <br/>such outlet, you are not to respond to that request, and all matters should <br/>be referred to Rob Milnthorp, who will deal with them appropriately.  If the <br/>requests come from customers, competitors, acquaintances, family, <br/>counterparts in Houston, and the like, you are simply to advise that you are <br/>unable to discuss the matter.<br/><br/>7. All matters are to be handled through the following people:<br/><br/>Rob Milnthorp, for all commercial matters;<br/>Peter Keohane, for all legal matters; and<br/>Dalton McGrath or one of his designated representatives of Blake, Cassels & <br/>Graydon.<br/><br/>I want to emphasize that Enron Canada Corp. is doing all of the appropriate <br/>things to ensure that our rights and interests are protected, while being as <br/>cooperative as possible.  I want to emphasize the Enron Canada Corp. believes <br/>any claim made by or through Industry Canada is without merit, and the steps <br/>we have taken should only be viewed as prudent and not as any indication of <br/>any liability by Enron Canada Corp.<br/><br/>Regards, Peter<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n",

I assume this will be covered in <br/>Canada's budget.  <mark>Send me a towel.</mark><br/><br/>Regards<br/>Delainey<br/>---------------------- Forwarded by David W Delainey/HOU/ECT on 01/20/2001 <br/>06:14 PM ---------------------------<br/><br/><br/>Rob Milnthorp<br/>01/17/2001 06:09 PM<br/>To: David W Delainey/HOU/ECT@ECT<br/>cc:  <br/>Subject: Retail Branding<br/><br/>Dave, Pope has been working with the Stampeder organization for the last six <br/>months on creating a sponsorship package for our Retail business. Our first <br/>goal was to attempt to get the naming rights to McMahon Stadium (not unlike <br/>the Canadian Airlines Saddledome, Enron Field, etc.). At this point the <br/>naming rights are off the table. However, we have the opportunity to grab the <br/>naming rights to the Labour Day Classic as well as some other season-long <br/>involvement. Terms of the deal at this point are as follows:<br/><br/>1. \"Enron Labor day Classsic\" and 100 thirty-second radio spots promoting the <br/>Enron Labor day Classic + Newspaper Ads<br/> 40,000 Enron logo cheering towels to be distributed pre-game<br/> Exclusive sponsorship on the cover of the game day program<br/> Enron logo on the player's jerseys<br/><br/>2. Season long involvement <br/> End-Zone advertising<br/> 1 full-page color ad in the Stamp's 2001 yearbook<br/> 12 season tickets<br/> 12 red & white club memberships<br/><br/>Cost would be approx $100K Cdn (still be negotiated). <br/><br/>In terms of our overall strategy for branding, this is likely the only <br/>initiative that we would pursue in 2001 as we like that it has good <br/>penetration for the entire province of Alberta as well as national exposure. <br/>The Labour day game draws the biggest crowd each season, has been sold out <br/>eight out the past nine seasons, and is the largest single day sporting event <br/>in Calgary each year. Last year the \"battle of Alberta\" attracted over <br/>750,000 viewers on CBC. The timing is also very good as we will be fully <br/>functional by September. <br/><br/>Let me know what you think.<br/><br/>Regards<br/>Milnthorp<br/>\n",

Brulte<br/><br/><br/>=09<br/><br/><br/><br/>Greetings All:<br/><br/>First, I am apologizing in advance for any typos in this email.  Schedule i=<br/>s=20<br/>very tight, but I wanted to make sure that everyone had it first thing this=<br/>=20<br/>morning, with some back-up info that I've included below.<br/><br/>Attached is the email that was sent to Ken Lay's office yesterday evening f=<br/>or=20<br/>delivery to Sen. Brulte.  It's of course confidential.  Few points:<br/><br/><mark>I don't have Bev's email, so if you could please forward to her, that would=</mark><br/>=20<br/>be appreciated.<br/>As we discussed (Jim, Mike, Bev, Scott, Hedy) on our lengthy call on=20<br/>Wednesday, I'm assuming that the plan is still to \"wallpaper\" Sacramento wi=<br/>th=20<br/>our proposed legislation.<br/>This email does not contain the legislation.  Mike sent the \"final\" version=<br/>s=20<br/>of our legislation out yesterday, except for the siting piece, which I=20<br/>believe Brian Cragg of Mike's office is finalizing today.<br/>You'll note that we promise Senator Brulte in the email that we'll deliver =<br/>to=20<br/>his office today the proposed legislation.  Again, based on our call on=20<br/>Wednesday, I'm assuming that we would simultaneously release the proposed=<br/>=20<br/>legislation to the rest of the world at the same time.<br/>When we spoke on Wednesday, we decided that the Sacramento team would=20<br/>determine to whom we would circulate the proposed legislation at the same=<br/>=20<br/>time that we deliver the Senator Brulte. I'm assuming that you folks will=<br/>=20<br/>handle that end of things.  Please let us know at your convenience to whom=<br/>=20<br/>you've decided to circulate.<br/>This email does, however, include a \"summary\" of our proposed legislation. =<br/>=20<br/>But I'm not certain that the summary included in this email is the=20<br/>appropriate language to distribute \"to the world,\" or if we'll need instead=<br/>=20<br/>to tailor some new language.  I think we all agreed that we need a \"one=20<br/>pager\" to accompany the legislative package so that we can communicate the=<br/>=20<br/>package effectively.<br/>We also discussed the need to quickly develop a coalition to support our=20<br/>proposals.  We didn't finalize that plan.  Perhaps the Sacramento team coul=<br/>d=20<br/>propose a plan to do that.  Perhaps we could start with our friends in the=<br/>=20<br/>Direct Access coalition?<br/>We also talked about the need at this point to engage in PR and to get the =<br/>PR=20<br/>machinery activated, also with the goal of effectively communicating our=20<br/>legislative package/message.  We're in a meeting with folks today where we=<br/>=20<br/>can discuss getting that side of things going and Karen Denne has contacted=<br/>=20<br/>Marathon and they're pondering some things that we can do in the near term.<br/>You'll note that there's a considerable amount of information about the DWR=<br/>=20<br/>credit issue.  As I recollect, we discussed the issue in depth on the call.=<br/> =20<br/>You note that attached to the email is a \"legislative fix\" to AB1X that cou=<br/>ld=20<br/>solve the credit issue and an attached set of \"taking points\" related to a=<br/>=20<br/>second alternative to solving the credit issue:  a PUC order clarifying tha=<br/>t=20<br/>DWR will get its money for power purchase costs.<br/>Note also that Steve Kean reminded me that we've got to continue to push to=<br/>=20<br/>get the utilities out of the merchant function.  Accordingly, I've put a=20<br/>brief paragraph on that issue in the note to Brulte in the last section=20<br/>(legislative solution) under the topic \"create a real competitive retail=20<br/>market in California.\"  To the best of my knowledge, we don't have=20<br/>legislative language on that piece yet, and it seems that we'll need to=20<br/>discuss it in considerably more depth before doing so.<br/><br/><br/>If you have any questions about any of the materials in the email, please=<br/>=20<br/>don't hesitate to contact me or Jim or Sandi to discuss.

Key Barriers to Distributed Generation<br/><br/>Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges<br/><br/>Solution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took=<br/> a=20<br/>step in the right direction.  Utility stand-by charges have always been=20<br/>designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract=20<br/>monopoly prices from customers, or both.  But there is no reason to limit t=<br/>he=20<br/>elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than=20<br/>1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for=<br/>=20<br/>California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc=<br/>e=20<br/>the risk of black outs this summer.  We would propose lifting the cap by=20<br/>offering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development o=<br/>f=20<br/>distributed generation.<br/>=20<br/>Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with=20<br/>investor-owned and municipal utilities<br/><br/>Solution:   The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is =<br/>a=20<br/>step in the right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete=20<br/>interconnection studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this=<br/>=20<br/>requirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed=20<br/>generation.  In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when=<br/>=20<br/>interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome=<br/>=20<br/>through executive orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent=20<br/>possible, California should shift control over interconnection away from th=<br/>e=20<br/>utility and place that control with the California ISO.  This could be=20<br/>accomplished through amendments to SB 27X.<br/><br/>Permitting and Air Quality Issues<br/>Developers of distributed (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs=<br/> or=20<br/>greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an=<br/>d=20<br/>therefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale=20<br/>generation faces. =20<br/><br/>Solution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru=<br/>=20<br/>D-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant=<br/>=20<br/>output apply equally to smaller scale, =01&distributed generation=018 facil=<br/>ities.=20<br/>In addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to=<br/>=20<br/>face local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial=20<br/>interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects=<br/>. =20<br/>These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.<br/><br/>3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase=<br/>=20<br/>Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities=20<br/><br/>Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with=<br/>=20<br/>suppliers.<br/>Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th=<br/>e=20<br/>goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible.<br/>However, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk=<br/>=20<br/>concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms.<br/>We understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c=<br/>redit=20<br/>risk concerns.<br/>Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and=<br/>=20<br/>is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to=<br/>=20<br/>both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements=<br/>=20<br/>going forward.<br/><br/>Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue<br/><br/>Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority<br/>The language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to=20<br/>charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our=<br/>=20<br/>analysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the=20<br/>California PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  =<br/>As=20<br/>such, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat=<br/>es=20<br/>adequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.<br/><br/>Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018<br/>The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public=<br/>=20<br/>Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are=<br/>=20<br/>=01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref=<br/>use to=20<br/>allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20<br/>purchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr=<br/>ee=20<br/>to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that=<br/>=20<br/>DWR has entered into with suppliers.<br/>=20<br/>Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to=<br/>=20<br/>Recover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases<br/>In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority=<br/>=20<br/>noted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to=<br/>=20<br/>the specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl=<br/>oy to=20<br/>permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i=<br/>s=20<br/>extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu=<br/>re=20<br/>DWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it =<br/>is=20<br/>difficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in=<br/>=20<br/>rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase=<br/>=20<br/>costs.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since=<br/>=20<br/>suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover=<br/>=20<br/>from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.<br/><br/>Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20<br/><br/>We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri=<br/>sk=20<br/>issues.  We have identified three options:<br/><br/>Amend AB1X<br/>The amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the=<br/>=20<br/>PUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur=<br/>red by=20<br/>DWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary =<br/>to=20<br/>ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the=<br/>=20<br/>preferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political=<br/>=20<br/>challenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file=20<br/>entitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.)<br/><br/>Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20<br/>through Contract Language<br/>This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20<br/>implement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo=<br/>re=20<br/>time to implement than the \"legislative\" fix.  We have attached electronic=<br/>=20<br/>copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC=<br/>=20<br/>would need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled,=20<br/>=01&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018)<br/><br/>Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk<br/>As indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac=<br/>cept=20<br/>other forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit,=<br/>=20<br/>cash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have=<br/>=20<br/>indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR=<br/>=20<br/>prefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through=<br/>=20<br/>contract amendments.<br/><br/>4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001<br/><br/>Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20<br/>Associates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports=<br/>=20<br/>showing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They diffe=<br/>r=20<br/>only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  Al=<br/>l=20<br/>credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer=<br/>=20<br/>of 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are=20<br/>likely. =20<br/><br/>CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this=20<br/>summer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our=20<br/>estimates.  California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin,=<br/> well=20<br/>below the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio=<br/>n=20<br/>in the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power=<br/>=20<br/>than other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the=20<br/>unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t=<br/>o=20<br/>date. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t=<br/>he=20<br/>flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20<br/>California=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to =<br/>this=20<br/>requirement. =20<br/><br/>Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early=<br/>=20<br/>draw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's seve=<br/>re=20<br/>supply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced=<br/>=20<br/>number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the=20<br/>utilities.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren=<br/>t=20<br/>pace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be=<br/>=20<br/>added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.<br/><br/>CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of=<br/>=20<br/>rolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more=20<br/>optimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000=<br/>=20<br/>MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that California=<br/>=20<br/>should view the CEC's \"rosy scenario\" with considerable skepticism.<br/><br/>5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California=<br/>=01,s=20<br/>Electricity Crisis<br/><br/>This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We wil=<br/>l=20<br/>deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing=<br/>=20<br/>bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.<br/><br/>As we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's=20<br/>crisis must focus on four issues:<br/><br/>Increase supply<br/>Decrease demand<br/>Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market<br/>Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency<br/><br/>Increase supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher)<br/>To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. =<br/>=20<br/>Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less=<br/>=20<br/>than a year.  In California, it takes about six years, or longer.<br/><br/>The Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi=<br/>slation=20<br/>are steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve tho=<br/>se=20<br/>efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face=<br/>=20<br/>in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit=20<br/>requirements included in the CEC's certification requirements.  Enron=01,s=<br/>=20<br/>proposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)=20<br/>transfering credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an=20<br/>innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund=20<br/>emissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected a=<br/>ir=20<br/>districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the=20<br/>required reductions in pollution emissions.<br/><br/>Decrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright)<br/>Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing=<br/>=20<br/>the supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the=<br/>=20<br/>best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished mo=<br/>st=20<br/>effectively and quickly in two ways:<br/><br/>Buy-down demand<br/>California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun=<br/>d=20<br/>to finance DWR=01,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand=<br/> more=20<br/>economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou=<br/>ld=20<br/>be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,=<br/>=20<br/>through the summer months).  DWR could easily run an on-line auction to=20<br/>determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.  To=20<br/>participate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment=20<br/>necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the=20<br/>reductions.  Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&D=<br/>eal=20<br/>Bench,=018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort.<br/><br/>Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment<br/>To be successful, customers need access to the following key elements:<br/><br/>An internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price=<br/>=20<br/>for hour-ahead power in real time.=20<br/>Real-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment=<br/>=20<br/>verification.<br/>Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be=<br/>=20<br/>paid for load reduction (=01&Negawatts=018).<br/><br/>The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ=<br/>e:<br/><br/>=01&creation=018 of additional summer peaking capacity in California, parti=<br/>cularly=20<br/>in the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation=<br/>=20<br/>resources.<br/>reduction of  peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California=20<br/>electric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity =<br/>in=20<br/>the state.<br/>fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris=<br/>k=20<br/>of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to=20<br/>customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for=<br/>=20<br/>responding.=20<br/><br/>We estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in=<br/>=20<br/>excess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for=<br/>=20<br/>summer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.  We further estimate=<br/>=20<br/>that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 time=<br/>s=20<br/>that amount.  We recommend that the State of California provide rebates=20<br/>directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and=20<br/>control systems that would support load curtailment implementation.<br/><br/>Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market=01*Legislative vehi=<br/>cle:=20<br/>SB27X<br/>The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we=<br/>re=20<br/>customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy=<br/>=20<br/>service providers.  Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from=<br/>=20<br/>customers and businesses.  It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th=<br/>e=20<br/>prohibition against Direct Access.<br/><br/>Enron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a=<br/>=20<br/>direct access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department o=<br/>f=20<br/>Water Resources' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from=<br/>=20<br/>customer migration. =20<br/><br/>In addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when=<br/>=20<br/>the utility is removed completely from the procurement function.  Procureme=<br/>nt=20<br/>is not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial=20<br/>condition in which the utilities now find themselves.  California should=20<br/>therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement=20<br/>function entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a=20<br/>non-utility provider within 36 months.  To execute the transition, Californ=<br/>ia=20<br/>should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period =<br/>in=20<br/>which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments=<br/>=20<br/>of utility load.<br/><br/>Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency=01*Legislative =<br/>vehicle:=20<br/>AB18X<br/>Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand=<br/>. =20<br/>In short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California=01,s supply-demand=20<br/>imbalance.  In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers=<br/>=20<br/>and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ=<br/>ia=20<br/>State government assume the role of =01&electricity buyer=018 for an extend=<br/>ed=20<br/>period of time.  Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc=<br/>e=20<br/>in California's energy markets and the private sector's willingness to=20<br/>participate in that market.<br/><br/>California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a=<br/>=20<br/>series of staged rate increases.  California should design those rate=20<br/>increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without=<br/>=20<br/>=01&shocking=018 the economy or household budgets For example, California c=<br/>ould=20<br/>amortize the recovery of the utilities=01, past debt over a 5-10 year perio=<br/>d. =20<br/>In addition, the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways:=<br/>=20<br/>First, the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in=20<br/>recognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of =<br/>AB=20<br/>1890.

      "On Friday, January 26, 2001, an earthquake rocked the western region of <br/>India. The earthquake reportedly had a magnitude of  7.9 and was centered in <br/>the state of Gujarat.

Coletta Eichenberger<br/>314 High St.<br/>Boonville, MO 65233<br/>cbeichenberger@undata.com<br/><br/>To Mr. Ken Lay,<br/><br/>I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.<br/><br/>Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.<br/><br/>The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  <mark>Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.</mark><br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Rev.

First of all,  I <br/>requested meetings with the audit and EHS folks to understand our procedures <br/>and our status.  So, no fair ranting at Don.  Secondly, your note brings to <br/>mind what I find the most troublesome about our process as it currently <br/>stands.  It is not now, nor will it be in the future the audit department's <br/>responsibility to ensure that corrective actions are taken as a result of the <br/>audit process.  It is the responsibility of the business leader and the <br/>business management.  So, follow up with the companies should have been a <br/>communication from you to the business unit head, not from Don to the <br/>business and Don to you.  <br/><br/>But, we are going to work all of this out and in the meantime, we aren't <br/>going to get crosswise with each other.  This is going to be an \"open kimono\" <br/>kind of place and no information is going to be managed away from me.  I will <br/>be staying on top of things and I will be involved with all of the support <br/>groups, with the business leaders and with the executive managment..  And, <br/>problems that are uncovered will be owned by all of us responsible for the <br/>business and the appropriate handling of those issues will be a matter of <br/>performance between the business and myself.<br/><br/><mark>So, please, calm down and let's all get off on the right foot.</mark>  Enjoy your <br/>holiday, darn it!<br/><br/>Rebecca<br/><br/><br/><br/>Peter E Weidler@ENRON<br/>12/17/2000 05:55 PM<br/>To: Don Hawkins/OTS/Enron@Enron<br/>cc: James A Hughes/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Rebecca <br/>McDonald/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT <br/><br/>Subject: Re: spreadsheet  <br/><br/>Don - really - this kind of upsets me - I thought you were going to call me <br/>if we were having any problems - this report looks like crap and is not <br/>reflective of actual status - I know TGS has completed most of its <br/>outstanding items -  Does your team call and follow up with the individual <br/>companies - requesting a status report ?    If so give me the names of who <br/>called and who you talked to  and the date of the call.   What is the concern <br/>about Cuiaba - they got a 90 + score -  TGS and Centragas are in South <br/>America - not carribbean.   Why did you not list the scores ?     Really - I <br/>think this report and the handling of transmitting this information is <br/>completely different from my understanding of our understanding of how this <br/>is supposed to work.    You were going to follow up with the companies and <br/>let me know if there were any problems and I was going to go fix the problems <br/>-  Report says there are problems and the first I hear of it is when  you go <br/>and report to my bosses.

Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.<br/><br/>Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.<br/><br/>The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  <mark>Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.</mark><br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Michael Powell\n",

      "-Origin: NEMEC-G<br/>X-FileName: gnemec.nsf<br/><br/>Gerald, It seems that the drafts that have been sent back to Marathon have <br/>confused the relationships of Marathon, Mariner and MEGS. As an example you <br/>have requested that the LOPSA rely on the O&M Agreement between Mariner and <br/>MEGS, which Marathon is not a party.  We would rather that agreement remain <br/>between MEGS and Mariner and be the basis for your resolution of disputes. <br/>The legal capacities presented in your response to the LOPSA draft are <br/>confusing. All rights seem to flow to MEGS, yet the obligations seem to be on <br/>Mariner, we do not believe the division of rights and obligations in this <br/>manner are a good situation. By example the Indemnity provisions have been <br/>altered to have Mariner indemnify the Owners and Operator (no mention of <br/>MEGS)and then further change the indemnity to a negligence based indemnity <br/>(of Platform Operator). The PHA is a unilateral indemnity to Platform <br/>Operator and Platform Owners and we must insist on this same level of <br/>protection with MEGS.<br/>If you would like to make another attempt at either a ratification or LOPSA <br/>that addresses MEGS as Lessee and Mariner as its operator and provide for any <br/>resolution between those two in the O&M Agreement we would be happy to <br/>discuss this further. If you would like to go through the LOPSA line by line <br/><mark>please call and we can set up a teleconference with our legal department to</mark> <br/>do so.<br/>BGP<br/><br/>>>> <Gerald.Nemec@enron.com> 05/31/00 01:04pm >>><br/><br/>I have reviewed your response and disagree with the characterization of our<br/>modification the documents. I would like to clarify our reasons for the<br/>modifications to avoid any further miscommunications.<br/><br/>MEGS' alteration of the documents do not impair the protections afforded to<br/>Marathon under the Production Handling Agreement.  Our modifications were<br/>simply intended to allocate certain risks between MEGS and Mariner with<br/>respect to Marathon (as operator of the South Pass 89 B Platform) as such<br/>risks were intended to be allocated by MEGS and Mariner.  Mariner's<br/>transfer of interest in the flowline to MEGS introduces a new party which<br/>Marathon can look to for certain obligations with respect to the platform.<br/>The alterations do not remove Mariner from its current role as operator and<br/>maintainer of the flowline and owner of the hydrocarbons.  For these<br/>reasons, I would disagree with your response that the draft alterations do<br/>not provide the intended protections that Marathon would expect absent such<br/>a transfer to MEGS.  Mariner still shoulders these risks and expenses under<br/>the Production Handling Agreement.<br/><br/>Having MEGS fully ratify the Production Handling Agreement  and becoming<br/>jointly and severally liable to Marathon is not appropriate.   MEGS does<br/>not hold title to any hydrocarbon production or operate the facilities and<br/>should not be liable for all risks and expenses associated therewith.<br/>Mariner should continue to shoulder those risks and as before.<br/><br/>I would be happy to discuss your issues with our Platform Lease revisions<br/>at your convenience or to discuss the above further.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>                    \"Bradley G<br/>                    Penn\"                 To:     Gerald.Nemec@enron.com<br/>                    <bgpenn@marath        cc:     <br/>ERGetz@GROUPWISE.MarathonOil.com,<br/>                    onoil.com>            JCAlbert@GROUPWISE.MarathonOil.com<br/>                                          Subject:     Platform Lease -Reply<br/>                    05/26/2000<br/>                    10:00 AM<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Attached are our response and ratification agreement.<br/>BGP<br/><br/>>>> \"Gerald Nemec\" <Gerald.Nemec@enron.com> 05/25/00 04:49pm >>><br/><br/><br/>Brad,  Can you give me a status on where you are at with the review of the<br/>Lease<br/>Docs for the MEGS Facilities?

Would your company be covering travel and hotel expenses?  If <br/>not I would need to get internal sign off to cover any expenses you would <br/>have.  <mark>Please can you tell me either way so that I can make the requisite</mark> <br/>inquiries if required.<br/><br/>The speakers at the conference have provided me with between 5-8 bullet <br/>points for their talks.  Could you email me a few ideas with regard to the <br/>content of the talk and I will email back my ideas.  I have attached one of <br/>the talks at the conference to give you an idea of the style of the talks <br/>which have already been included.<br/><br/>I look forward to speaking with you later this afternoon.<br/><br/>Kind regards<br/><br/>Julia Shaw<br/>Conference Producer<br/>Tel:44 171 915 5650<br/>Fax:44 171 915 5001<br/>Email:jshaw@iir-conferences.com<br/><br/><br/>>>> \"Vince J Kaminski\" <vkamins@ect.enron.com> 09/27/99 07:05pm >>><br/><br/><br/>Dear Ms. Shaw,<br/><br/><br/>I have just returned from London. One of the points on my<br/>agenda was an internal seminar  on the topic of real options<br/>my group offered to the Enron unit in London. Real options is<br/>a valuation technology I have been promoting internally<br/>for quite a long time.<br/><br/>I shall be glad to speak at your conference. Proposed topic:<br/>\"Real Options and Valuation of Fixed Assets in the Energy Industry\".<br/><br/>Please, let me know if this of interest to you.<br/><br/>Vince Kaminski<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Julia Shaw <JSHAW@IIRLTD.CO.UK> on 09/24/99 06:13:07 AM<br/><br/>To:   Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT<br/>cc:<br/>Subject:  Real Options Conference Monday 21st & Tuesday 22nd February  2000<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dear Mr Kaminski,<br/><br/>I was given your name by Ann Wagoner and I believe that you area speaking at <br/>her<br/>conference on Real Options.  I work in the London office of IIR and am putting<br/>on a similar conference.  Your company has been mentioned by a wide variety of<br/>people who I have spoken with about real options.  A number of people have<br/>mentioned that your company is regarded very much as a market leader.<br/><br/>I would like to discover if a representative from ENRON might be interested in<br/>speaking at the conference.  I have attached the draft programme with agreed<br/>speakers to date.  The conference is by no means set in stone and if a speaker<br/>from ENRON decided to become involved I would ensure that you were given a <br/>good<br/>speaking slot in the conference and would have editorial control over the <br/>talk.<br/><br/>I very much hope that ENRON will become involved with the conference and I <br/>look<br/>forward to speaking with you today or next week about the prospect.<br/><br/>Kind regards<br/><br/>Julia Shaw<br/>Conference Producer<br/>Tel 44 171 915 5650<br/>Fax 44 171 915 5001<br/>Email:jshaw@iirltd.co.uk<br/><br/><br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                       !<br/>!<br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                       !<br/>!<br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                                              <br/>                                                       !<br/>!<br/><br/><br/> - Smith.doc<br/>\n",

      "-Origin: Sager-E<br/>X-FileName: esager.nsf<br/><br/>For purposes of going forward, attached are the various drafts relating to <br/>ERCOT product changes we have been discussing:<br/><br/>1.  Re 11:00 am scheduling deadline.   This effort was sidelined because (i) <br/>it would fix the problem that surfaced with TXU, and (ii) in most instances I <br/>understand us to prefer the presence of the 11:00 am deadline to cuase the <br/>sheduling to be wrapped up under potential threat of LDs. <br/>  <br/><br/>2.  EOL financially firm UB product.  Doug, I believe you want to explore if <br/>the reference to the B product can be eliminated altogether.<br/><br/><br/><br/>3.  ERCOT wide and Zonal EOL products.  Questions clearly present are: (1) <br/>uncertain duration of the zones, and what should happen to the commitments of <br/>the parties when newly defined zones replace the old. The marketplace can't <br/>even be assured of zonal changeovers each October.  (Buyer serving load is <br/>most at risk)  (2)  uncertainty over whether the B product classification <br/>will persist, and what the Opertating guides will say about it or a <br/>subsequent Firm (LD) product, (3) whether delivery can only take place inside <br/>a zone, rather than at its border.   Doug you said you were considering <br/>rolling out an ERCOT wide product and then afterwards offering North and <br/>South Zones, followed by West Zone if there's market interest. <br/><br/> <br/><br/><mark>Please come back to me with any thoughts you have on these draft efforts.</mark> <br/>--DP\n",

Krameria<br/>Denver, CO<br/>bgriss@yahoo.com<br/><br/>To Mr. Ken Lay,<br/><br/>I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.<br/><br/>Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.<br/><br/>The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  <mark>Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.</mark><br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Barb Griss\n",

Essentially, the value proposition involves <br/>\"wrapping\" an existing gas horspower station with a Compression Service <br/>Agreement and allowing the Pipeline to pay for the shaft horspower in <br/>commodities other than (or solely in) cash.  ECS provides shaft horsepower <br/>(meaning that we bring gas, as opposed to elecricity) to the compressor.  <br/>Because Shippers would continue to pay for its fuel per the existing tariff, <br/>the Pipeline would utilize shipper fuel to pay for shaft horsepower.  This <br/>structure represents an avenue for the Pipeline to hedge the value of the <br/>molecules it collects from Shippers or simply to levelize their fuel burn.  <br/>Timing and basis differences could, presumably, be included to increase the <br/>value to the Pipeline and potentially passed through to the Shippers.  <br/><br/>Attached is a deal example that I recently presented to Great Lakes Gas <br/>Transmission that solves a fuel levelization problem they have on their <br/>system....they overcollect in the Winter and undercollect in the Summer.  It <br/>may be of some use in reviewing to help ascertain answers to the following:<br/><br/>1) Would a gas compression service deal be required to be filed by the FERC?  <br/>My sence is that the answer is no. This is simply an O&M service<br/> contract and lease agreement.<br/>2) If a Pipeline is on an annual gas tracker, what would be the tracker <br/>implication?  It should be flat, as technically, ECS has not changed the<br/> amount of fuel collected/utilized....we have only provided optionality as to <br/>hedgeing???<br/><br/><br/><mark>Please give me a call to discuss.</mark><br/><br/>Thanks<br/><br/>Chris Meyer<br/>x31666<br/>\n",

I =<br/>still dont see us bringing in any real brutal arctic air, but the SE ridge =<br/>that has been in place for much of January is no more. In all cases, the mo=<br/>dels suppress the storm track to the Southern U.S. which opens the door to =<br/>another potentially major winter storm, but quite a bit farther South than =<br/>the last one. The solutions are all over the place which one would expect t=<br/>his far out. One aspect that struck me as noteworthy was the Canadian's dep=<br/>iction of a large arctic high over the Northern U.S. It has had it for thre=<br/>e runs in a row, but given the high surface pressures does not look as cold=<br/> as I would have expected. It's just another product of a strange winter I =<br/>suspect. So, while I still am not in any kind of arctic camp on this, I do =<br/>be! lieve the areas of above normal temperatures will be very limited. I lo=<br/>ok for most areas to run near or slightly below normal.

      "<br/><br/>       FROM ROB WALLS AND JOHN ALE<br/><br/>First, thank you very much for your prompt responses to our requests for comments on the draft Agreement and Plan of Merger distributed Tuesday and for items that would go on a disclosure schedule.  This has been hard work in a short period.<br/><br/>More hard work is to come.  Although no decision has been made on whether our company wishes to pursue this alternative and, if so, whether acceptable terms can be reached, we have been instructed to be in a position to sign the agreement and deliver the disclosure letter by this Sunday night.  To this end, we are attaching a revised draft of the agreement.<br/><br/>Please review again the provisions of this agreement to see whether there are any further changes to be made.  We are collating the information you have provided for disclosure schedules and will circulate a draft tonight or Friday morning for your further comments.<br/><br/>Note that we are attempting to have the term \"Subsidiary\" defined to include only consolidated subsidiaires.  We must be prepared, however, to include some representations about significant off-balance-sheet entities.  Accordingly, as you review drafts of the agreement and the disclosure letter, please note any comments that apply only to unconsolidated entities.  <mark>Please return your comments to Rob Walls (EB 5012) or John Ale (3AC 1023) by Friday at 3:00 pm.</mark>  If you send matters by email, please send it to both of us and Norma Tidrow (at Azurix).  <br/><br/>As before, if you need to speak with someone else in your group, please clear that with one of us.  If you have any questions, please call one of us.  Also, given that we may need to make changes over the weekend, please let us know how we can reach you over the weekend.<br/><br/>Thanks in advance for your continued help.<br/><br/>Rob Walls       John Ale<br/>x6-6017       x5-5263<br/>Cell (713) 562-7572      Cell (713) 305-8263<br/><br/>cc: Jim Derrick, Lance Schuler<br/><br/>\n",

Beacon Avenue<br/>Spokane, WA 99208<br/>jgaines@wellsstjohn.com<br/><br/>To Mr. Ken Lay,<br/><br/>I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.<br/><br/>Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.<br/><br/>The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  <mark>Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.</mark><br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Jennifer Gaines\n",

Delegate <br/>bookings have been much higher than this time last year. As  a result, we are <br/>set to far exceed the number of delegates that attention  earlier this year. <br/>The three workshops and the one-day Asset Management Forum  are also very <br/>well received and will probably reach full capacity. I will of  course <br/>provide you with much fuller details closer to the time of the  event.<br/>?<br/>Regarding the event itself, I would like a few  outstanding issues:<br/>?<br/>1. Presentations: can you please  e-mail your presentation to me by 15th <br/>December, so that I have  enough time to reproduce them and place them in a <br/>delegate pack for the  Convention. (Given the break of the Christmas and New <br/>York period, and that the  event is being held in New York, I am sure you can <br/>appreciate that there are  certain logistical factors that need to be taken <br/>into account, hence the reason  why the presentations are required as soon as <br/>possible). This is purely for  reproduction, we also request you bring your <br/>presentation to the Convention  on the day in either a floppy disc or a <br/>laptop.<br/>?<br/>2. Audio-Visual Requirements: can  you please inform me of what audio-visual <br/>requirements you may have (35mm  slides; OHP; LCD projection - notably <br/>PowerPoint). <br/>?<br/>3. Check list: I have attached a  check list for your information. If you <br/><mark>have not returned this already, can you  please read and fax it to my</mark> <br/>colleague, Claire as soon as possible.<br/>?<br/>If you have any questions or queries, please do not  hesitate to contact me, <br/>otherwise I eagerly await your response in due  course.<br/>?<br/>I look forward to seeing you in New York in  February.<br/>?<br/>Kind regards<br/>?<br/>Andreas<br/><br/>_____________________________<br/>Andreas  Simou<br/>GARP 2001 - Conference Producer<br/>Tel? +44 (0) 20 7626  9301<br/>Fax +44 (0) 20 7626 9900<br/>?<br/>Don't miss the GARP 2001 Convention, <br/>program  details via our web site<br/>www.garp.com  <br/> - speaker checklist.doc<br/><br/>\n",

Hardie, about a couple of issues.<br/>First is whether we should increase the general partner's share from .0001%<br/>to .0025% in order to reduce a possible risk that Brazos VPP Limited<br/>Partnership might somehow not be treated as a partnership for tax purposes.<br/>T. does not feel strongly about this (in part because the consequences<br/>should not be adverse) and, unless Kevin desires otherwise, I think we<br/>should leave the percentage at .0001%.  (Any tax law with respect to the<br/>minimum .0025% level is probably obsolete now that we have \"check-the-box\"<br/>elections for tax treatment as a partnership.)  Nora advises me that Stan<br/>is fine with this from an accounting perspective.<br/><br/>The second tax issue is whether Agave, as depositor under the Trust<br/>Agreement, can be tax matters partner for the Trust (which will also elect<br/>to be taxed as a partnership).  Since only a partner can be tax matters<br/>partner, it appears that one of the Class B Certificateholders -- i.e.,<br/>Bank of America -- must be the tax matters partner.  The Servicer can of<br/>course assist with preparation of income tax filings.<br/><br/>Balancing Agreement<br/><br/>Attached below is a revised Balancing Agreement, with the changes discussed<br/>on Monday night by Nora, Tim, Teresa, Bob and me.  The principal change is<br/>to add an indemnity section to this Agreement in place of the indemnity we<br/>want to delete from the Participation Agreement that Bracewell Patterson<br/>has prepared.  This indemnity is based on the Term Sheet and is<br/>considerably narrower, but since we did not discuss it specifically, please<br/>review it carefully.  Please pay attention to the note following the<br/>definition of \"Servicer Fee\" that suggests that the LIBOR breakage costs<br/>and capital adequacy costs be moved to the new indemnity section.  Nora and<br/>I think that this would be more appealing to the Banks, but Stan may prefer<br/>to have this built into the Servicing Fee.<br/><br/>(See attached file: Balancing Agreement Ver 5 from 4.doc)<br/><br/>Physical Sales Contracts<br/><br/>One of our biggest challenges to a quick closing is getting everyone to<br/>agree on some important features of the master gas and oil purchase/sale<br/>agreements.  The term sheet given to the Banks says the following:<br/><br/>     A.   With respect to each Production Payment under which Brazos<br/>     expects to receive deliveries of natural gas in kind, Brazos shall<br/>     enter into a confirmation under the NGPSA with ENA whereby ENA or ERAC<br/>     shall (1) purchase all gas or oil delivered to the Company in kind<br/>     under such Production Payment and (2) pay floating prices for such gas<br/>     or oil.  The floating prices will be swapped into pre-determined fixed<br/>     prices via an Energy Price Swap Agreement.<br/><br/>     B.   Brazos will dedicate to ENA or ERAC all Production Payment gas or<br/>     oil which is delivered under the Production Payments documents.<br/><br/>     C.   The quantities of gas or oil purchased each month shall consist<br/>     of all gas or oilactually delivered in kind to Brazos during such<br/>     month under the Production Payment.  ENA and ERAC will be notified<br/>     monthly in advance of the amount of gas or oil expected to be<br/>     delivered at each delivery point.<br/><br/>     D.   If the actual quantity of Production Payment hydrocarbons<br/>     delivered to Brazos is less than the scheduled quantity of<br/>     hydrocarbons to be delivered (the \"Scheduled Volumes\"), and the<br/>     producer has not delivered adjustment quantities of Production Payment<br/>     hydrocarbons to satisfy such deficiency, the Servicer (i.e., Agave,<br/>     the new Enron subsidiary guaranteed by Enron Corp.) will make a<br/>     mandatory advance equal to the value of such deficiency at the<br/>     applicable ENA or ERAC price.<br/><br/>     E.   As consideration for the mandatory advance, Brazos will assign to<br/>     the Servicer the right to receive the Adjustment Quantities (or cash)<br/>     that Brazos is entitled to receive under the Production Payment<br/>     documents related to such delivery under the Production Payment.<br/><br/>In analyzing the physical contracts, and all other components of this deal,<br/>it is important to remember that one purpose of the deal is to lock in, for<br/>at least the 97% debt component of the total financing, a cash flow stream<br/>that amortizes the debt over the entire term of each Production Payment.<br/>The pieces of the deal -- the oil and gas accruing to the Production<br/>Payment, the physical sales contracts, and the swaps -- have to fit<br/>together for the entire life of each Production Payment.<br/><br/>It is also important to remember that if there is a mismatch in cash flows,<br/>it will most likely be made up by payments from Enron Corp. under its<br/>guaranty of Agave's mandatory \"balancing\" advances.  So it behooves Enron,<br/>as well as the Banks, to make sure that the pieces of the deal fit<br/>together.<br/><br/>It therefore seems to me that the physical contracts need to have the<br/>following features:<br/><br/>1.   the physical contracts need to cover all of the production accruing to<br/>each Production Payment during the life of that Production Payment,<br/>including both scheduled quantities and adjustment quantities.  Therefore<br/>there can be no minimum or maximum limits on quantities taken, and the<br/>right to terminate the physical contracts must be limited to a real<br/>melt-down situation.  It is probably misleading to talk about the scheduled<br/>amounts being on a firm basis.<br/><br/>2.   the physical contracts need to match the commodity price swaps that<br/>ENA will be providing for the scheduled amounts of production, with<br/>floating prices for these scheduled amounts that are identical to the<br/>floating swap prices.  Therefore the Contract Prices for the scheduled<br/>amounts of gas need to key off of Inside FERC and the Contract Prices for<br/>the scheduled amounts of oil need to key off of NYMEX WTI, in each case<br/>with any agreed basis differentials.<br/><br/>3.   the physical contracts need to price the adjustment quantities in a<br/>way that causes the adjustment quantities to generate enough cash to repay<br/>Agave/Enron for any mandatory balancing advances.  The way to do this is to<br/>price any deliveries in excess of the scheduled amounts at the Index Prices<br/>contained in the production payment conveyances.  The Index Prices for gas<br/>in the two existing deals are Gas Daily prices and for oil are NYMEX WTI<br/>less differentials.<br/><br/>4.   the physical contracts need to match the timing of the conveyances for<br/>adjustment quantities.  This is daily for gas deliveries and monthly for<br/>oil deliveries.<br/><br/>5.   the physical contracts need to have a cover formula that protects both<br/>ENA/ERAC and Agave/Enron.  The present formula in the Enfolio contract says<br/>that ENA pays the Contract Price for the scheduled quantities that are<br/>delivered and that Brazos pays the product of the shortfall in scheduled<br/>quantities times the positive remainder, if any, of the Index Price minus<br/>the Contract Price.  We need to change this last feature to say that Brazos<br/>pays this remainder, if positive, but that Brazos also gets a credit is<br/>this remainder is negative.  Tim Proffitt can explain the math to anyone<br/>that wants to understand it, but the basic idea is that if there is a<br/>shortfall, Brazos buys gas from ENA at the Index Price to cover the<br/>shortfall and then ENA pays the Contract Price for the full scheduled<br/>amount.<br/><br/>6.   the contracts need to do away with any concept of frequent trading<br/>over the phone.  Each Production Payment should generate only one written<br/>confirmation.<br/><br/>7.   the contracts need to be clear that netting occurs over all<br/>transactions.  This should protect ENA and ERAC against Brazos owing them<br/>money for one Production Payment where production has substantially shut<br/>down and not having the ability to pay.<br/><br/>In light of the above, we also need to consider whether we are better off<br/>starting with the modern Enfolio form that is designed for true commercial<br/>transactions or whether it makes more sense to add the points described<br/>above to the old Cactus form.<br/><br/>John W.

He is finding that he is not fully utilizing his skills at Optimark and that the company is moving more towards software development.  Consequently he is looking at other possibilities.  He obviously has an interesting background that includes systems development, management and a strong technical training.  Ideally, he could fit somewhere between research and systems development.

I previously told him that because of timing <br/>considerations and because there may be certain agreements that will be <br/>difficult to make TurboPark compliant (such as the attached interconnect <br/>agreement from FPL), that Phase 2 may not be practical for purposes of this <br/>project.<br/><br/>I think this would be a good discussion to have on Friday, because we should <br/>have more information on the GE7FAs and should have already spoken with TECO <br/>on their proposed MOU (and maybe even the tolling agreement).

I've discussed this arrangement with Jane and she is in agreement.  (Twanda, do you mind printing this on EGM letterhead for Michelle to initial?  I'm happy to come pick it up, or you can send to me at ECN 3678a. Thanks!)<br/> <br/>Additionally, we would like to extend Jane's contract so she can continue to submit candidates to us.  Her original contract ended on September 30th.  We'd like to extend it for a six month term beginning October 1st, continuing through March 31st.  I've spoken with Jane and she agrees that there will not be an additional retainer fee charged to us by reinstating our contract.  (Diane, is this as easy as just running new executable copies of the contract, changing only the dates or would we just create a one page amendment to the existing contract for signature by all parties?).  We would like to continue working with them under the same fee structure as though our contract with them never ended (i.e. our next hire will be at a 25% fee).<br/><br/>Thanks for your help, ladies!

RUTH, you need to read these notes and render and opinion <== that's an accounting term.<br/><br/>Of course all rules are made to be broken but here are some ideas<br/><br/><mark>1.  Put the notes in a word document and save it with the following naming scheme</mark><br/>  Notes_(pipeline name).doc <br/><br/>  Example ==>  Notes_Tennessee.doc<br/><br/>2.

At a minimum, put the date you are making the notes, I don't think the time is so important.  I put in the time when its conversation, I just put in the date when I spend a couple hours working on something.  Ha - me work a couple of hours!!<br/><br/>4.  Put your initials at the end of the note so we know who made it.<br/><br/>5.  When you put someone's name in the document, put their phone number and tell us who it is, at least the first time you mention their name if that person is not someone we all deal with.  usually this would be the person your are speaking with at the pipeline.  First person that comes to me and says \"buy me a pop\" gets $.60.<br/><br/>6.

Apologies for any omissions, inaccuracies, etc.  Others who were on <br/>the call please chime in if I've gotten anything wrong, or missed anything.<br/><br/>Best,<br/>Jeff<br/><br/>SUMMARY<br/>Enron, Duke, El Paso and Williams were on the call, as was Michael Hoffman of <br/>the Blackstone Group (the Governor's financial advisors).<br/>On the subject of how the group would organize itself, it was agreed that the <br/>calls would be open to anyone who wanted to participate.<br/>A smaller group consisting of Duke, El Paso, Enron, and Williams would take <br/>the lead on walking the halls of Sacramento, meeting with policy makers, and <br/>advocating whatever plan the group develops.<br/>Folks agreed that achieving a comprehesive solution requires a tangible <br/>process; that is, the principals need to get in a room, face to face, for <br/>however long it takes to work out a resolution.<br/>It was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning of <br/>next week, and that it should take place in Sacramento.<br/>It was decided that the Legislature and the Attorney General needed to be <br/>brought into the process as soon as possible, i.e., next week.<br/>There was some discussion regarding the release today of \"Plan B.\"  Plan B is <br/>a plan proposed by Democratic and Republican legislators as an alternative to <br/>the MOU that the Governor struck with Edison.  After that call I received a <br/>copy of \"Plan B.\"  <mark>If you'd like a copy please send me your fax number.</mark><br/>Folks on the call agreed to have the next \"supplier-only\" call-in meeting on <br/>Friday.<br/>Finally, Michael Hoffman said that they are hoping to have a \"ratings agency <br/>level\" presentation prepared by the end of the week.  The goal of the <br/>presentation is to reassure capital markets that the bonds the state seeks to <br/>issue are solidly backed by retail rates.<br/><br/>The Agenda for Tomorrow's Call with the Governor's Staff<br/>Item #1:  The Credit Issue<br/>Michael Hoffman said that the Governor's office wants to start tomorrow's <br/>meeting discussing the creditworthiness issue.  <br/>Hoffman said that the Governor's folks are hoping to have completed by the <br/>start of tomorrow's meeting a draft of an agreement between the California <br/>PUC and CDWR.  The agreement is designed to ensure that DWR gets paid for <br/>power services delivered.  <br/>If the draft is ready, they'd like to discuss on the call tomorrow.  <br/><br/>Item #2:  Identify the Components of a Comprehensive Solution.<br/>It was agreed that our group should put on the table at tomorrow's meeting <br/>the universe of issues that need to be included in a comprehensive solution.<br/>Enron was asked to take a first stab at what those components are.  The <br/>following is a brief outline, which is not intended to be definitive, but a <br/>starting point for discussion.<br/>Utility creditworthiness<br/>retail rates must reflect costs<br/>Increase supply<br/>streamline and otherwise reform the siting process<br/>Decrease demand<br/>establish real-time pricing<br/>implement demand buy-down and other conservation programs<br/>Create a real market<br/>Remove the State from the power-buying business as soon as possible (e.g., <br/>once new rates are in place and utilities are returned to creditworthiness; <br/>approximately 3-6 months)<br/>Return the procurement role to the utilities<br/>Reinstate Direct Access immediately for all customers<br/>Within 18-24 months, create a \"core/noncore\" market structure for <br/>electricity, similar to California's market structure for natural gas<br/>Keep the industry in the hands of the private sector<br/>Reject proposals calling on the State to take over transmission, generation, <br/>etc. <br/>Resolve outstanding legal claims, investigations, etc.<br/>Resolution requires certainty and prompt payment (understanding that <br/>discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion)\n",

Learning<br/>about Enron's use of leading-edge practices was quite enlightening and I<br/>truly benefited from our visit.<br/><br/>Secondly, I've summarized my key \"take-aways\" as stated below.  Before<br/>conveying it to my management, however, I really appreciate it if you can<br/><mark>pls review my conclusions and ensure that they are not miss-stated.</mark><br/><br/>Again, thanks so much for your time and wisdom.  I was also honored that you<br/>gave me a copy of the \"Managing Energy Price Risk\" book and shall reference<br/>it with interest.  THANK YOU.<br/><br/>I really look forward to seeing you again next time I'm in Houston.<br/><br/>Best regards,<br/>Soussan<br/>(914) 253-4187<br/><br/>PS.  The latest Fortune article on ENE is a great read and substantiates the<br/>company's innovative and creative approach to business.<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>------<br/>As you may know, I was invited to visit with Enron (ENE) last week.  I met<br/>with Vince Kaminski, the VP and head of research in the risk management<br/>group of ENE.  Vince who used to be with Salomon Brothers and AT&T is the<br/>\"brain\" of ENE w.r.t. their analytical tools for pricing of commodities,<br/>hedging, optimization of financial and physical transactions, as well as the<br/>value-at-risk systems.  In addition, Vince has received the 1999 James H.<br/>McGraw Award for Energy Risk Management (Energy Risk Manager of the Year)<br/>and is well published.  He is the key contributor to a best-selling<br/>publication by Risk Books entitled: Managing Energy Price Risk.<br/><br/>Our meeting was mainly focused on gaining additional insights re<br/>leading-edge practices within ENE.  My key findings are summarized below:<br/><br/>1. ENE does not use corporate price premises.  They use market price info<br/>only and adhere to mark-to-market accounting.<br/>2. ENE uses the \"Heath, Jarrow, and Morton\" methods for modeling price<br/>dynamics (I've asked BIC for a copy of the associated paper).  They have<br/>their own \"home-grown\" software, however, they periodically review selected<br/>external developments for internal inclusion and advancement.<br/>3. Vince's group comprises of Mathematicians, Physicists, and Operations<br/>Researchers who are responsible for the development and advancement of ENE's<br/>risk management tools.  These models are religiously used by the traders,<br/>risk managers, and BUs across ENE.<br/>4. Investment proposals are screened, risked, and \"ROVed\" by a separate<br/>corporate group (similar to our Special Studies and with business and real<br/>options skills) who work in conjunction with the BUs.  All evaluations and<br/>transactions are marked-to-market.<br/>5. ENE does not use efficient-frontier portfolio concepts.  They \"VC fund\"<br/>any opportunity that has a credible value proposition and can stand on its<br/>own.  They believe that with the current plentiful liquidity in the market,<br/>project-financing in not an issue for a \"good\" opportunity.  However, they<br/>closely monitor the development of each opportunity, within their deep<br/>portfolio, at the corporate level and know how to \"fail fast\".<br/>6. The employee reward system is based on P&Ls as well as the creation of<br/>new business.<br/>7. Most employees have stock options.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed my visit and hope to meet with Vince again the next time<br/>I'm in Houston.<br/><br/>\n",

As far as I am aware <br/>there is no brokerage or agency arrangement with either EFT or <br/>EnronCredit.com in this regard and therefore traders sitting in London should <br/>not execute these transactions independently of the traders sitting in <br/>Houston.  <br/><br/>From a booking perspective in this type of situation generally a separate <br/>trading book should be mainatined by ENA.  It may be acceptable for <br/>EnronCredit.com to risk manage ENA's credit derivaties postions provided the <br/>requisite service agreement has been put in place - this is really a question <br/>for ENA - Mark ?.  I do not know if such a service agreement is in place.  <br/><br/>Where a transaction is booked into ENA and not bt-backed with .Com the market <br/>risk will reside with ENA - a btb with .Com would be necessary to consolidate <br/>the mtm of the ENA credit derivatives business in .Com.  In view of the fact <br/>that Bryan is viewing all credit derivatives business as a global book, all <br/>credit derivatives business entered into by Enron entities other than <br/>EnronCredit.com should be back-to-backed with .Com.  In situations where ENA <br/>has sold protection and .Com has bought protection on the same name this <br/>internal structure will permit ENA immediately Delivering on the Portfolio of <br/>Deliverable Obligations it as received as the Seller of protection to .Com <br/>which can in turn can Deliver on to the counterparty it has bought protection <br/>from.  As a result all hedged trandsactions should have matched terms <br/>regardless of the Enron booking entity.<br/><br/><mark>Mark, Paul can you add further clarification as to the position (particularly</mark> <br/>where I haven't hit the mark !).<br/><br/>tks,<br/><br/>Denis<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Bryan Seyfried<br/>11/06/2000 13:57<br/>To: Elaine Bannerman-Sowah/LON/ECT@ECT<br/>cc: Denis O'Connell/LON/ECT@ECT, David A Wall/Risk Mgmt/LON/ECT@ECT <br/><br/>Subject: Re: ENA / Enron Credit.com  <br/><br/>In reality, I think of there being a single global book and terms should <br/>match across internal legal entities.  The only reason for booking into two <br/>separate entities is for Tax and/or regulatory reasons.  The risk is managed <br/>out of London, I don't think there is any reason to back-to-back trades into <br/>EnronCredit.com but will defer to the appropriate tax, legal and control <br/>personnel.  I don't think a services agreement has been set up yet.<br/><br/>We should try to close the open issues next week.

Mark Gershon (Piper Rudnick) is preparing a draft letter for the <br/>County using the Assessment Agreement form utilized in our Kendall County <br/>Special Use Permit as a template and based upon discussions between myself, <br/>Rusty, Mark, and Warren Schick/Robert Tillota of ENA's tax department.

Wednesday, April 18, at 10 a.m.<br/><br/>The NERC Board of Trustees is scheduled to have a very important meeting on <br/>Friday, March 30th, on the future organization of NERC-the so-called \"NERC to <br/>NAERO transition.\"  NERC is poised to eliminate its traditional board <br/>structure, long dominated by its regional councils, and adopt an independent <br/>board along with some form of a stakeholder advisory committee.  This <br/>watershed event provides an opportunity for EPSA, and its member companies, <br/>to carefully evaluate participation in NERC, its committees and the <br/>activities in the regions.<br/><br/>Specifically, we want to focus on what matters, if any, NERC is presently <br/>addressing that warrant the continued attention and participation of EPSA <br/>and/or its members.  For those issues that are affecting, or could <br/>potentially affect, the business interests of EPSA's members, what is the <br/>most efficient and effective role EPSA could play?  What is the best forum <br/>for resolving reliability-related technical issues beyond FERC's expertise?<br/><br/>To facilitate this discussion, EPSA will be hosting a half-day summit to <br/>discuss the outcome of NERC's March 30th meeting and its implications for <br/>EPSA's allocation of resources to NERC activities on Wednesday, April 18 at <br/>10 a.m.  We encourage members to attend in person at the new EPSA offices at <br/>1401 New York Ave., 11th Floor, Washington, D.C.  However, we will also make <br/>participation by conference call available.  We encourage all companies, <br/>whether or not they are currently active in NERC, to participate in this <br/>important meeting.<br/><br/>Please RSVP for the meeting using the form below to Jackie Gallagher either <br/>by fax (202-628-8260) or e-mail (jgallagher@epsa.org).<br/><br/>NERC Summit<br/><br/>_____  Yes, I will attend the April 18th meeting<br/><br/>_____  No, I will not be able to attend in person, but I would like to<br/>            participate by phone.<br/><br/>Name:___________________ Company:__________________________<br/><br/>Phone: __________________ E-mail:_____________________________<br/><br/><br/>\n",

All fuel which Duke shall provide Transwestern shall be at the <br/>Tariff fuel rate.  Bob Burleson has decided not to monetize the difference <br/>between actual fuel and Tariff fuel (difference being only .19%) and revise <br/>the rate given that the current economics of the deal already provide for a <br/>24% rate of return (not including any fuel retainage \"value added\" factor).<br/><br/>Transwestern shall pay Duke $750,000 for Duke facility upgrades in order to <br/>increase gas receipts into Transwestern from Duke's Artesia plant and Big <br/>Eddy gathering system by an incremental 20,000 Dth/d.

On the open and after the first three hours of trading it sure looked like our forecast from Friday of a trending<br/>market to the down side was going right. However on VERY light volume in the cash market the posture of the limited number of players was to trade sideways to up, in the last two hours<br/>of the session. Today it was told that this was the lightest trading day on the Nasdaq and the second lightest on NYSE.<br/><br/>Where do we go from here? Frankly this one is a whole lot tougher to make a call than in the past. But lets look at the technical picture and see wants painting. First the Wave traders<br/>needed to take out 1265.00 last week. Since there bias on the market was that it failed, then the new trend was down to long term support. How we see it at least for the moment.<br/>Looking strictly at a old fashion technical forecast methodology. Today we had a conformation of a inverted head and shoulder with the right shoulder breaking out to the long side.<br/>This formation was started 5/30 and completed today. Along with this a classic \"W\" formation. The defined high of 1319.00 on a channel breakout added credence to what we \"think\" might<br/>be more upside momentum. And yes since our system did make a trend change to the long side we wanted to see from end of day data what may of confirmed the move.<br/><br/>For those of you who know me and we have spoken before. Then its no surprise for me to reiterate my (montra) about trading systems that are available to the retail public. Since I was<br/>introduced to \"SYSTEM TRADING\" back in 1994.00 and have never looked back I more convinced that this is the only way to trade the futures markets for long term success. However I also<br/>feel very strong that if anything is good in a computerized non subjective trading program and that if its going to have any real long term life to it, (then why would any one sell<br/>it?) The fact is from my perspective that anything with real value is kept propritiary or its under management just as our system is.<br/><br/>I found this section in the June edition of Futures magizine, go to page #52 in the middle of the page is a obsevation from them on tracking systems.

And both<br/>technical and cash data is calculated inorder to confirm trend changes.We have our computer models take a look back every hour on the half hour to re check if any trend changes have<br/>been violated regardless of where the futures are.<br/><br/>What most of the retail public has is no idea that infact all the large firms both equity's and futures have there own (platforms) and there own (systems). Its been proven that as long<br/>as one has a sound trading methodology that is coded and it can be looked and judged over long time frames, this is the ONLY way to make gains that can show year after year. Human<br/>intervention has created more losses in the futures markets than I care to think of. It never fails that I talk to traders every day who pound there chest on what they did \"today\" but<br/>whats more important is to look at what one has done over lets say a three year time frame. This is the secret for long term success.<br/><br/><br/>On the E-mail that has been sent out in the last few weeks on the new market starting 8/21/2001 \"Single Stock futures\" This will be very exciting for us due to the fact that we will be<br/>one of the first firms in the country to offer this new market in a Managed program with the underlying trading methodology stemming from computer based models. The large firms will<br/>have access to this market first then the retail public will begin 12/21/2001. As long as there are no problems that surface with the CFTC and SEC then Dec looks good.<br/><br/>For those of you who are not aware of the back ground of our programmers they have a history in the Futures and Equity side of the industry from institutional firms that are all<br/>computer based with there own trading programs.<br/><br/>Again for those traders who are not aware of this market we will be able to trade futures on single stock issues. For example IBM will have a contract that will have 100 shares in a<br/>contract. And that will have a life of 90 days just like the current four trading contract months per year.

The<br/>Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME) today signed a letter of intent to create a joint venture to introduce single-stock futures, following<br/>approval by the boards of directors of both exchanges. The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) has also agreed to participate in the joint venture with a limited stake. Legislation signed<br/>into law in December will allow the introduction of single-stock futures by U.S. financial exchanges later this year, after an 18-year prohibition on the products. \"Today's<br/>announcement highlights the innovation and entrepreneurial spirit among Chicago's exchanges,\" said CBOE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William Brodsky. \"This exciting new<br/>initiative combines the best of securities and futures trading. Our willingness to work together on this venture will ensure that Chicago remains the world's center in derivatives<br/>trading and risk management.\" \"The creation of this joint venture recognizes the tremendous synergies of CME and CBOE, making us a formidable competitor in the global marketplace for<br/>single-stock futures,\" said CME Chairman Scott Gordon. \"Our complementary customer bases of retail and institutional investors will benefit from the efforts of all three Chicago<br/>exchanges to establish deep pools of liquidity in these products.\" \"I am enthused that Chicago's exchanges have worked so well together to understand and address our customers' needs<br/>and our members' concerns,\" said CBOE Vice Chairman Mark Duffy. \"We have designed a product that, I believe, will appeal to our customers, and a business structure that will provide<br/>great benefit to our members.\" \"Our largest customers have emphasized the importance of collaboration between the CBOE and CME to combine the capabilities, distribution and<br/>connectivity of the futures and securities worlds,\" said CME President and Chief Executive Officer Jim McNulty. \"This alliance should also provide the highest level of capital<br/>efficiency for our customers who trade in both futures and options.\" \"The CBOT is pleased to work with the leadership of CBOE and CME in this initiative to bring this exciting new<br/>product to our markets,\" said Nicholas Neubauer Chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade. \"The involvement of our members and the access to our customers will make important<br/>contributions to the success of this venture.\" The joint venture will be a for-profit company, will have its own management and board, and will be separately organized as a regulated<br/>exchange. Single-stock futures will be traded electronically, and orders may be entered through both the new CBOEdirectTM electronic platform and CME's GLOBEX?2 electronic trading<br/>system. CME and CBOE officials said they are engaged in negotiations with the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), which clears all CBOE transactions, to clear the new products. McNulty<br/>said the negotiations contemplate CME becoming a special clearing member of OCC to provide access for CME clearing members who are not members of the OCC. The exchanges anticipate<br/>contracting with Designated Primary Market-Makers (DPMs) in these products and expect that the board appointed to govern the joint venture will determine the eligibility criteria,<br/>selection process, rights, privileges and duration of such arrangements. Single-stock futures are expected to bring new efficiencies to securities trading, securities lending and<br/>corporate hedging activities. CME and CBOE officials said they also expect to develop rules that would accommodate block trading and exchange-for-physicals (EFPs). The Chicago Board<br/>Options Exchange created and launched the first listed options on stocks in 1973 and the first index options in 1982. Today, CBOE lists options on more than 1,500 stocks and on over 40<br/>indexes, such as the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial AverageSM, the Russell 2000, the Nasdaq-100, and the S&P 100. It remains the world's largest and most successful options<br/>marketplace. Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. launched the first successful stock index futures contracts on the S&P 500 in 1982. Today, CME trades futures and futures options on<br/>indexes including the S&P 500, Nasdaq-100, S&P MidCap 400, Russell 2000, FORTUNE e-50? , S&P/BARRA Growth and Value Indexes, and Nikkei 225, as well as its electronically traded E-mini<br/>S&P 500 and E-mini Nasdaq-100 contracts - the fastest growing products in the exchange's history. CME also trades interest rate, foreign currency and agricultural commodity products.<br/>On November 13, 2000, CME demutualized and became a for-profit, shareholder-owned corporation. CBOE is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). CME is regulated by<br/>the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Additional information about the CBOE and CME can be found at their respective Web sites: www.cboe.com and www.cme.com.<br/><br/><br/>If anyone who would like to chat in more detail on our CTA managed accts please dont hesitate to call me at toll free (800) 773-1713<br/><br/><br/>Thank you<br/><br/>Jerry Jacobs<br/>C.T.A.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>IF ANYONE WHO DID NOT GET THE \"PDF\" FILE ATTACHMENT SHOWING THE THREE YEAR<br/>LONG TERM NUMBERS AND FULL CFTC DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT PLEASE E-MAIL<br/>OR CALL TOLL FREE (800) 773-1713 AND WE WILL RESEND IT RIGHT AWAY<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>RISK DISCLOSURE STATEMENT<br/><br/>THE RISK OF LOSS IN TRADING COMMODITIES CAN BE SUBSTANTIAL.

With respect to Dynegy Power Marketing, my records reflect that they are <br/>approved for all products (including financial & power).  Can you let me know <br/>if your approvals reflect otherwise?<br/><br/>2.  With respect to Nicor Gas Company and Northern Illinois Gas Company:  <br/>Northern Illinois Gas Company should be restyled to be \"Northern Illinois Gas <br/>Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company\".  We have just received the executed ISDA <br/>Master with this entity and that is how the counterparty directed us to set <br/>the master up.  Nicor Gas Company appears to be their physical gas trading <br/>arm, so that entity name should be left alone.<br/><br/>I haven't forgotten the 8/11/00 list, I am waiting to hear back from <br/>Australia about a question.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n",

Analysts, <br/>media etc. will be expecting the year over year comparison.  Secondly, I <br/>strongly suggest taking out the conference call reference - you will end up <br/>with media and others on the call. You can notify the analysts seperately by <br/>putting a note on FirstCall.  Thanks.

First, we are comparing 2Q to 1Q 2000 in the opening <br/>paragraph, as the comparison is more favorable.  We do mention 2Q 2000 to 2Q <br/>1999 further down in the body of the release.   We have also added operating <br/>cash flow per unit at the suggestion of one of our executive staff.   <br/>Finally, we have added a paragraph detailing the analyst conference call at <br/>the suggestion of our Investor Relations group.  <br/><br/><mark>Please provide your comments to me by noon, Monday, July 17 to incorporate</mark> <br/>into the second draft.

The gist of those agreements is that the ETS family of companies is subject to new restrictions on their interaction with the rest of Enron.  To assure compliance with these new obligations, I'd like to remove ETS personel from the OPI structure.  I don't have the full slate of officers and directors in front of me, but I do recall that Dave Neubauer took my old job as OPI president, and I believe Mary Kay Miller and several other ETS folks are still officers and/or directors.  <mark>Please give me a call at your earliest convenience to discuss.</mark>  Thanks.

The NGMS contract in Section 8 allows 1 year to <br/>recover volume changes and the HPLC Mktg contract in Section 8 allows 2 years <br/>to recover volume changes.  Per our conversation today, the contract <br/>provisions override the state law and Entex should not be invoiced the <br/>additional volumes.<br/><br/>Janet, since we cannot rebill Entex do you still want us to reallocate and <br/>then write off the dollar amounts.<br/>This would enable us to be in sync from a physical volume side.

The Entex analysis  has been done for 1998 and had one <br/>adjustment for June 1998 of 14,660 additional invoiced to Entex.  The 1997 <br/>analysis was done within the last month and this is when the discrepancies <br/>were found.  I have done a preliminary analysis for 1996 and the only <br/>material volume appears to be in April 1996 of 8,296 additional volume <br/>needing to be invoiced to Entex.  The 1996 will be completed by Mid March. <br/><br/>I sent Ami the 1997 analysis to ask her how she wanted to address the issue <br/>of whether or not you wanted to go back to Entex.    <br/><br/>The Statute of Limitations is 4 years, so both the 1996 and 1997 adjustments <br/>would fall within this timeframe.<br/><br/>Please contact me if there are any other questions or issues.<br/>HC<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n",

The company has exceeded debt-reduction=20<br/>targets and expects debt to be<br/>    about 50% of total capital by 2002. If sales continue to grow at even=<br/>=20<br/>one-half the historical 3% to 4% per year,<br/>    cash flow interest coverage should improve to 3.5 times by then. Still,=<br/>=20<br/>the ratings on El Paso Electric continue to<br/>    reflect the company=01,s high leverage, dependence on nuclear power, hi=<br/>gh=20<br/>fixed costs, and high rates.=20<br/><br/>    The company borrowed heavily to fund its 15.8% interest in the Palo Ver=<br/>de=20<br/>nuclear plant, which supplies 50% of<br/>    the utility=01,s power. The plant=01,s past operating problems and cont=<br/>inued=20<br/>structural problems add some risk to the<br/>    company=01,s already weak financial profile. Most importantly, customer=<br/>s in=20<br/>the generally low-income service<br/>    territory fought against rate increases needed to recover the nuclear=<br/>=20<br/>investment, helping to put El Paso Electric<br/>    in bankruptcy. A settlement signed with Texas customers in 1995 allowed=<br/>=20<br/>the company to keep a $25 million<br/>    rate increase implemented in 1994, permitted accelerated depreciation o=<br/>f=20<br/>generation and transmission assets,<br/>    and froze rates until 2005 in exchange for extending the El Paso Electr=<br/>ic=20<br/>franchise.=20<br/><br/>    In 1998, the company agreed to reduce rates--mainly residential--in New=<br/>=20<br/>Mexico and Texas, bringing them<br/>    more in line with Southwestern averages. By the time retail competition=<br/>=20<br/>comes to either state (2002), El Paso<br/>    Electric will have a fairly competitive cost structure which should all=<br/>ow=20<br/>them to retain retail customers. By that<br/>    time, El Paso Electric will have separated its assets into a regulated=<br/>=20<br/>transmission and distribution business<br/>    and an unregulated electricity generation business, as required by New=<br/>=20<br/>Mexico and Texas law. Costs incurred<br/>    to effect this change will be recovered in a competitive transition=20<br/>charge. Stranded costs (accrued charges<br/>    related to generating plant costs which would have been recovered in a=<br/>=20<br/>regulated market) will be recovered over<br/>    a five-year transition period in New Mexico. In Texas, the rate=20<br/>settlement allowed El Paso to recover those costs<br/>    through accelerated depreciation over the 10-year period of the=20<br/>settlement agreement.=20<br/><br/>    In the wholesale market, El Paso successfully renegotiated contracts wi=<br/>th=20<br/>the Comision Federal de<br/>    Electricidad, the national utility of Mexico, to supply peaking capacit=<br/>y=20<br/>in the summer months of 2000 and 2001,<br/>    and with the Rio Grande Electric Cooperative Inc. to supply power to tw=<br/>o=20<br/>Texas cities over a four-year period.<br/>    Importantly, El Paso Electric also reached a settlement with the city o=<br/>f=20<br/>Las Cruces, N.M., ending a long dispute<br/>    over that city=01,s threat to municipalize the electric distribution sy=<br/>stem.=20<br/>Las Cruces sales account for about 8% of<br/>    total revenue.=20<br/><br/><br/>\n",

      "<br/>Mark, Rob<br/><br/>My apologies for adding to your burden at this difficult time. However hopefully this might clarify our discussions of yesterday and enable us all to move on quickly.<br/><br/>Enron Europe and its directors are facing two related issues: <br/><br/>1. Continuing to trade<br/><br/>The directors of EEL and its subsids have to be satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect of avoiding an insolvent liquidation. This is a fairly low hurdle to pass and, in our situation, calls made on Corp. for cash have been promptly met and we have read the news today of a new confirmed facility so we already have a fair degree of comfort. <br/><br/>The directors meet with independent counsel tomorrow but I believe that they will probably come out of that session asking for nothing more than a confirmation, by email to say Michael Brown, but from the top - Jeff or Greg, of where they currently see things, ie a positive prognosis for the future. That piece of electronic paper should be enough to enable the directors to reasonably conclude that we are not hurtling into Chapt 11 and to continue to trade. It would also be very helpful if that email could confirm that Michael would be promptly informed if things took a downward turn.  <br/><br/>I would be happy to draft a note but wonder whether the best way of quickly putting this to bed might be for a conversation to be had with Jeff/Greg to see what they would be prepared to say. That could then be drafted up and sent over. <br/><br/><br/>2. Filing accounts<br/><br/>The directors of Enron Europe and its subsids cannot file accounts on a going concern basis unless they are comfortable they will have adequate funds in the medium term to run their businesses. The hurdle here is higher than in point 1 above as prospective cash shortages would require the accounts to be qualified long before the directors would have to stop trading under point 1 above. So more comfort will probably be required here, which could include further details of the new facility (drawdown conditions and maturity periods) and prospects for further facilities being signed. This would back up the usual support letter. <br/><br/>I should add that we have not actually received this year the usual support letter from Corp. addressed to Enron Europe and its subsids. I don't know if it has been formally requested but we will definitely need to see that document this time around. <mark>Could you please point me in the right direction for that?</mark> <br/><br/>We now have until the end of January to file the accounts so point 1 above is definitely the immediately crucial issue. We would however like to resolve the accounts issue as soon as possible. Perhaps we could liaise with Joel to get a letter drafted and then signed by Jeff or Greg? <br/><br/><br/>That's it. It really boils down to requiring a bit more information from Corp. There is absolutely no desire to cause problems here, just a desire to put in place the right pieces of information (which we are sure are out there but we need to collect them in) which will safeguard the European directors personally and enable them to move on from these concerns to the more pressing business of Q4. <br/><br/>Many thanks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>        Mark<br/><br/><br/><br/> \n",

      "<mark>Jeff, will you coordinate with Peter for the legal PRC in getting all the</mark> <br/>info on the Cd lawyers so you and I can represent them at the PRC.<br/>----- Forwarded by Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT on 11/22/2000 01:14 PM -----<br/><br/> Chris Gaffney<br/> 11/17/2000 07:32 AM<br/>   <br/>   To: Peter Keohane/CAL/ECT@ECT<br/>   cc: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT<br/>   Subject: Year 2000 - Accomplishments<br/><br/>Peter - Some time ago you suggested that at year end review time I should <br/>provide you with a list of significant accomplishments.  The following is <br/>such list:<br/><br/>January through June with ENA<br/>NSTAR All RequirementsTransaction - While similar in structure to the United <br/>Illuminating transaction, the NSTAR deal provided challenge in that it came <br/>together in a very accelerated time frame.  We did not have the luxury of 6 <br/>months of negotiations as we did in UI.  We essentially structured and <br/>executed a deal in less than 3 weeks.  It was also a challenge in that I had <br/>no experience working with these particular clients (Kevin Presto, Dana <br/>Davis, Ed Baughman and John Llodra of East Power Trading/Mid Markets.  <br/>Another significant hurdle was the education process of the utility and its <br/>attorneys which was essential to get them comfortable with the complexities <br/>of an all requirements trading document.<br/>Consolidated Edison Turbine deal - This transaction was blown up at the <br/>eleventh hour, it was another challenging deal which required a creative <br/>structure to flip turbines into a project and take back a call on power.  <br/>Again the education of the utility and structuring of the transaction made <br/>this particular deal difficult.<br/><br/>July through November with ECC<br/>Sunoco structured power transaction - This was the first project I worked on <br/>in the Toronto office and was the first back to back transaction completed <br/>off of the British Energy PPA.  While the Calgary lawyers had put together a <br/>very good back to back precedent, there was still a great deal of negotiation <br/>involved in completing the deal and complexity involved in maintaining the <br/>requisite back to back transaction.<br/>G-6 structured transaction - This deal just (as of 40 minutes ago) blew up.  <br/>Notwithstanding that the deal will not be completed, it was a very <br/>complicated deal which involved a highly negotiated services agreement, <br/>arrangements for ECC to take initial equity and an option for additional <br/>equity and trading documentation.  This project required negotiating with 6 <br/>municipal electric utilities who were trying to set up a retail affiliate to <br/>market power in Ontario.  The structure would have ECC as a risk management <br/>and settlement services provider in exchange for being the exclusive <br/>wholesale supplier of energy to the G-6.  This involved mitigating and <br/>structuring around a myriad of legal issues.<br/>TransCanada structured power transaction - This was another back to back <br/>transaction off of the British Energy position.  These deal was challenging <br/>in that it involved a more sophisticated counterparty who had certain <br/>idiosyncratic issues such as regulatory risk and credit.  We were able to <br/>structure a deal which balanced the parties competing interests and <br/>maintained the commercial value of the transaction for Enron.<br/>OEFC Non-Utility Generation Contract Management - We have just recently been <br/>awarded the project and have begun negotiations with OEFC regarding <br/>management of the NUG contracts.  However, the teamwork exhibited among legal <br/>and commercial and between the Toronto and Calgary legal and commercial <br/>groups showed how effective the ECC operation can be.  Your advice and <br/>initial review together with my implementation structured an RFP response <br/>that did the right thing: protected ECC from potential legal risks.  While <br/>there was commercial pressure to bend from these principals we stood our <br/>ground and as a result have a much stronger bargaining position.<br/>Transition from Houston to Toronto - While both you and Mark know that there <br/>were some initial issues with respect to working out the arrangements for my <br/>move from Houston to Toronto I believe that I have transitioned quite <br/>smoothly.  I think that I have quickly gained the respect and trust of those <br/>in the Toronto office and of Rob Milnthorp.  Being the lone lawyer in a <br/>satellite office presents unique challenges; especially when the commercial <br/>folks are not content doing bread and butter type transactions but rather <br/>present highly structured deal on a weekly or even daily basis.  I understand <br/>and appreciate that you have gone out of your way to provide support to me <br/>when I have had issues arise on Toronto matters. In return I feel that I have <br/>provided you with comfort that the legal interests of Enron Canada are being <br/>protected and that our commercial team is receiving top notch legal support.  <br/>I have done this while still managing all of the little things that go along <br/>with moving your family 2000 miles.<br/><br/><br/>Regards<br/>CJG<br/><br/>\n",

IN summary:<br/><br/>- The Prime mInister and Oil Minister are open to discuss this project,<br/>in the context of clear future needs, estimated at 400 BCF by 2005. As a<br/>matter of fact, the Oil Minister - Wa'el Sabri - brought in his senior<br/>team to the meeting and scheduled a working session with Enron for<br/>September 27, at 10:00 AM<br/><br/>- In addition, the Royal Court (Diwan) support this development and has<br/>sent to the meetings Dr. Bassem Awadallah, the Economic Advisor to King<br/>Abdullah<br/><br/>- The Amoco deal is dead: they had an axclusivity arrangement which<br/>ended recently and they had in mind a pricing scheme linked to the \"fuel<br/>being used currently\" or to oil prices, both of which were totally<br/>unacceptable to JOrdan<br/><br/>- Whatever deal there is will need to compete against the odds that the<br/>deal with Irak, which provides Jordan with virtually \"free\" oil, will<br/>keep as it is. In fact, it is this deal which has allowed the Government<br/>to procrastinate on the AMOCO discussions<br/><br/>- Jordan is comfortable that there is gas in Risha, close to the Irak<br/>border. Schlumberger are currently exploring in that region. The thing<br/>is that the government is convinced that whatever gas they may find in<br/>Risha should not prevent them fromstriking a deal for an import scheme<br/><br/>- The government has been approached by the Saleh Kamel group of saudi<br/>arabia, which believes thay may be able to set up a new company which<br/>will develop gas fields in the northwestern part of saudi (Tabouk) and<br/>export it to Jordan. This is still at a very preliminary stage, but<br/>appears to be of great interest to the jordanians<br/><br/>- IN addition, British Gas approached the minister with a new scheme,<br/>relying on gas discovered \"off the coast of Gaza and Israel, which will<br/>require a shorter pipeline. the thing is that the Jordanians feel<br/>uncomfortable with imports through Israel at this stage of the \"peace<br/>process\"!<br/><br/>So here we are, welcome to pitch into this situation. I used the<br/>argument of speed of development and this is something we need to check<br/>with the Egyptians.<br/><br/>The course of action is as follows:<br/><br/>1. ENRON is to issue a letter to the Jordan Energy Minister (ASAP)<br/>stating the opportunity and formally requesting discussions. No<br/>MIDDLEMAN PLEASE...THIS WAS CLEARLY STATED BY THE PM and the Minister!.<br/>The address is:<br/>H.E. Eng. WA'EL SABRI<br/>Minister of Energy & Mineral Resources<br/>P.O.Box 140027, Amman, Jordan<br/>Fax No. 9626 586 5373<br/>Phone No. 9626 581 1338<br/><br/>A fax will do, as far as the minister is concerned.<br/><br/>2. A meeting has been scheduled on september 27, at 10:00 AM in the<br/>Minister's office. it is likely to be attended by Ahmad Bashir,<br/>secretary General of the Ministry and Rashad Aburas, Advisor to the<br/>Minister (National Electric Power Co.), plus some other people<br/><br/>3. Based on the demand projections and timing, the jordanians expect<br/>some kind of a formal proposal. time of important, as other competing<br/>schemes may have political or technical delays<br/><br/>Fellows, the Jordanians are supportive of the scheme and its sponsors,<br/>so we need to capitalize on this.<br/><br/>In line with my phone discussions with Rob, I will try to rearrange the<br/>meeting for monday sept. 25 and, if possible, our meeting in Cairo for<br/>sunday sept. 24.<br/><br/>I will keep you posted. Any thoughts on the competing schemes are most<br/>welcome.<br/><br/>Charles<br/><br/>\n",

Over the past few months we've been evaluating other service=<br/>=20<br/>providers to find out if it would be in Enron=01,s best interests, both=20<br/>financially and from a service point of view, to change registered agents. =<br/>=20<br/>We met with the Litigation Unit to ensure that service of process needs wou=<br/>ld=20<br/>be met and, hopefully, exceeded, and we talked with representatives of Enro=<br/>n=20<br/>tax departments re online information designed to assist the tax preparatio=<br/>n=20<br/>procedures.  We tested all aspects of the proposed services to our=20<br/>satisfaction, and we worked assiduously with the successful candidate to=20<br/>ensure Enron-user-friendly websites. We anticipate that there will be a=20<br/>saving to Enron of approximately $126,000 per year which will be passed=20<br/>directly to your cost centers.   After much kicking of the tyres we're=20<br/>terminating our relationship with CT Corporation System in favor of Nationa=<br/>l=20<br/>Registered Agents, Inc. (\"NRAI\").  NRAI will prepare, file, and absorb all=<br/>=20<br/>costs associated with the Change of Registered Agent.  We anticipate that t=<br/>he=20<br/>majority of Delaware Change of Registered Agent filings will be effective b=<br/>y=20<br/>the end of January but be aware that some other states take several months =<br/>to=20<br/>handle filings. The database will reflect the change of registered agent as=<br/>=20<br/>we receive evidence of filings.  As part of the process a free status check=<br/>=20<br/>will determine the good standing of all Enron entities.  We'll be happy to=<br/>=20<br/>pass these good standing certificates on to the relevant tax departments.<br/><br/>CT Corporation will remain as agent for those historical entities that were=<br/>=20<br/>voluntarily dissolved or withdrawn, and for contracts or agreements where C=<br/>T=20<br/>Corporation was named as registered agent for service of process (unless=20<br/>legal counsel decides to amend the terms.)<br/><br/>NRAI, a New Jersey-based company, was formed 5 years ago by ex-Prentice Hal=<br/>l=20<br/>managers.  It is now the third largest provider of registered agent service=<br/>s=20<br/>in the country.   It has a very strong, modern technology platform that=20<br/>enables it to respond quickly and effectively to its clients' needs, and it=<br/>=20<br/>offers a full range of nationwide Corporate, Uniform Commercial Code and=20<br/>Registered Agent services, and free, unrestricted access to its expansive=<br/>=20<br/>document library containing over 6,000 savable forms, official documents an=<br/>d=20<br/>information charts. =20<br/><br/>We will continue to provide document ordering services as before but for=20<br/>those of you whose staff prefer to place their own orders please ask them t=<br/>o=20<br/>contact me by email so that I can provide access information to the online=<br/>=20<br/>NRAI website so that your department can realize the cost savings we have=<br/>=20<br/>negotiated.  NRAI is offering training in how to use its website; please as=<br/>k=20<br/>your staff to contact me so we can set up a combined training session.<br/><br/>Please let me know if you would like more information on NRAI or on any of=<br/>=20<br/>the services they provide.<br/><br/>Happy Holidays!<br/><br/>Best regards<br/>Kate<br/><br/>NOTE: No changes will be made to TNPC entities until approved by Marc Manly=<br/>. =20<br/><br/>Tanya Sanford - please circulate this email to your legal assistant contact=<br/>s.<br/><br/>Kate B.

The<br/>incumbency certificates are enclosed.  Please insert names and other<br/>information as appropriate.  We need comments to the Escrow Agreement in as<br/>soon as possible in order that we can provide these documents to Citibank<br/>for approval.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Carolyn M.

      "Hi Folks,<br/><br/>Another wild week in the NFL.   We've got Footballguy Scott Luebke's Week 7<br/>Upgrade - Downgrade - Waiver Wire Picks.<br/><br/>Before we get to that though, let me throw out something I posted today on<br/>our message boards regarding owners who beat themselves up second guessing<br/>themselves.   This season has been as tough to predict as any in recent<br/>memory and I thought this might be something some of you might need to hear.<br/><br/>From our Message Boards www.footballguystalk.com<br/><br/>One of our message board members was (justifiably) frustrated with watching<br/>Trung Canidate blow up on his bench while Ahman Green and Ricky Williams<br/>fared less well as his starters.<br/><br/>My reply to him:<br/><br/>Don't be down on yourself.   That's the nature of the game.   There is no<br/>way you bench Ricky Williams or Ahman Green for Canidate when Canidate was<br/>such a question mark last week.   You did what just about every one of us<br/>would have done I'm guessing.<br/><br/>It's part of the game.   Is it frustrating?   Sure it is.   But it's still<br/>part of the game.   In my local league last week, I took a chance again on<br/>Antonio Freeman after starting him for the first few weeks (but not week 5 -<br/>Aargh... )   Did it play out?   No, it didn't.   I had guys on my bench who<br/>outscored him.   But looking back on everything I knew with Minnesota and<br/>Billy Schroeder, it was the right call for me.<br/><br/>I learned a long time ago the secret to Fantasy Football.   You just have to<br/><mark>take the best info you can assemble, make your call and let the players do</mark><br/>the rest.   Just like a real GM.   You can only do so much.<br/><br/>If you got beat because you didn't know Terry Glenn was out and you started<br/>him, well, that's your bad.   But if you got beat because Trung Canidate<br/>decided to play the game of his life, and proven RBs Williams and Green did<br/>not, well, that's not your fault.<br/><br/>I promise you, if you can predict things to that degree, you need to quit<br/>your job and head to Vegas.<br/><br/>Control what you can control.   Bust your butt to know all you can know.<br/>Make the best decisions you can make and be comfortable you've done all you<br/>can do.   After that, just enjoy the games.   Trust me, you'll be a better<br/>owner because of it.<br/><br/>Ok, let's jump to Scott's report for this week.<br/><br/>Have a great week, everyone.<br/><br/>Joe<br/><br/>/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/<br/><br/><br/>Upgrades<br/><br/><br/>QB - Tom Brady (Waiver Wire) - 5 touchdown passes in the last 2 weeks<br/>deserves an upgrade in my book.  More importantly, Brady has yet to throw an<br/>interception this season.  When Bledsoe returns from injury, the Patriots'<br/>coaching staff will have a very difficult decision to make.   There's even<br/>some talk that Bledsoe might not return this season.   Right now, Brady<br/>deserves a pickup by any fantasy team needing a quarterback.<br/><br/>QB - Tim Couch - The yardage numbers won't win any awards, but the 4<br/>touchdowns in the last 2 games is impressive.  Couch is starting to show<br/>signs of becoming a very good quarterback in this league.  Keep in mind, a<br/>tough schedule looms ahead for Couch.  However, with the Browns offense<br/>improving, he should be considered a top quarterback for teams in a keeper<br/>league looking towards the future.<br/><br/>QB - Doug Flutie - The Flutie magic continues to strike.  He's not the best<br/>fantasy quarterback, but numerous fantasy teams can be aided by inserting<br/>Flutie into the lineup.  With Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham staying healthy,<br/>Flutie should be considered a top 15 quarterback this season.  With a strong<br/>rushing game keeping defenses honest, look for Flutie to post numbers<br/>similar to Sunday on occasion.  280 passing yards and 2 scores is<br/>respectable against a tough Denver defense.<br/><br/>RB - Anthony Thomas -The A-Train continues to ride into fantasy starting<br/>lineups.  We've been hyping him for weeks and it appears he'll be named the<br/>official starter in Chicago shortly.  With 188 yards and a touchdown on<br/>Sunday, can the Bears afford to keep him out of the lineup?  I think not.<br/><br/>RB - Trung Canidate - Faulk owners need not worry about using Canidate as a<br/>filler.  232 total yards and 2 touchdowns...WOW!   At the very least he'll<br/>see more action even when Faulk is back.<br/><br/>RB - Jerome Bettis - Bettis has rolled to 4 consecutive 100-yard games.<br/>Look for this trend to continue.  With the Steelers defense playing<br/>excellent and Kordell Stewart limiting turnovers, look for Bettis to have<br/>more good games as the season progresses.<br/><br/>RB - Michael Pittman - We told you to jump off the Thomas Jones bandwagon<br/>and hop on the Pittman express earlier in the season.   With Pittman seeing<br/>80% of the carries and more importantly producing, all looks good for<br/>Pittman owners.  I've never been an advocate of starting Cardinals' running<br/>backs though.  After his 137 total yards and a touchdown performance, now<br/>may be the time to deal Pittman.<br/><br/>RB - Jason Brookins (Waiver Wire) - Terry Allen's ankle sprain may be all<br/>Brookins needs to become the team's starting running back.  He's looked good<br/>running behind a pretty solid offensive line, but his carries have been<br/>limited due to Allen's presence.  Keep in mind, the Ravens are contacting<br/>other teams about trading for another back prior to the trade deadline.<br/>Right now, Brookins is a solid waiver wire choice.<br/><br/>WR - David Patten (Waiver Wire) - Anyone who rushes, passes and receives for<br/>a touchdown in the same game deserves an upgrade.  With Terry Glenn being<br/>bothered by a hamstring injury, Patten made the most of his opportunity.  He<br/>has looked good over the last few weeks and has shown the ability to make<br/>plays, which is needed in the Patriots offense.  Grab him, if you are in<br/>need of a receiver.<br/><br/>WR - David Terrell (Waiver Wire) - Terrell had a breakout game on Sunday<br/>with 7 catches for 91 yards.  More importantly for his fantasy value, Marcus<br/>Robinson suffered a serious knee injury and is lost for the season.  The<br/>Robinson injury makes way for Terrell to enter the Bears' starting lineup.<br/>If you're in need of a receiver, Terrell is the best option in the free<br/>agent market, if he is still available.<br/><br/>WR - Keyshawn Johnson - Johnson has yet to score a touchdown this season,<br/>but he is doing everything else.  Johnson is averaging 8 catches/game and<br/>appears unstoppable at times.  However, he did suffer a hip flexor injury<br/>late in the game and appears questionable for this week's game.<br/><br/>WR - Johnnie Morton - Morton continues to impress this season.  He has<br/>surpassed the 100-yard mark 3 times this season and scored 3 touchdowns.<br/>With Germane Crowell and Herman Moore out for the season, Morton becomes the<br/>team's #1 wide receiver.  Morton owners should be happy.<br/><br/>WR - David Boston - Plain and simple, Boston is bigger, faster and better<br/>than any defensive back on the field.  In his first 5 games, Boston is<br/>averaging 96 receiving yards/game.  Keep him in your lineup every week.<br/><br/>WR - Jeff Graham - With the San Diego running game and LaDainian Tomlinson<br/>garnering a lot of attention, the receiving corps is able to see plenty of<br/>open spaces downfield.  Graham scored his first two touchdowns of the season<br/>and gained 107 yards on Sunday.  With defenses focusing on Tomlinson, look<br/>for Flutie to find Graham for 5-6 more touchdown passes this season.<br/><br/>WR - Rod Gardner (Waiver Wire) - While Michael Westbrook appears invisible,<br/>Gardner is impressing on the other side of the field.  208 yards and a<br/>touchdown (with another score called back), Gardner is starting to claim the<br/>title of \"best rookie receiver\".  Grab him, if he is available in your<br/>league.  Gardner is the lone bright spot in the Redskins passing game.<br/><br/>TE - Bubba Franks - Franks has been diagnosed with Cris Carter disease<br/>because \"All he does is catch touchdowns\".  6 touchdowns in 6 games.  If<br/>only he can start picking up yardage points.<br/><br/>TE - Cam Cleeland - Cleeland scored another touchdown on Sunday to increase<br/>the total to 4 scores this season.  With Aaron Brooks struggling to find his<br/>wide receivers in the red zone, Cleeland's value should remain high for a<br/>little while longer.<br/><br/><br/>/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/<br/><br/><br/>Downgrades<br/><br/><br/>QB - Aaron Brooks - Brooks has been struggling trying to find his receivers,<br/>especially in the red zone.  With just 4 touchdowns in his last 4 games,<br/>Brooks is in a minor slump.  There's no need to jump off his bandwagon.  On<br/>the flip side, an upturn in production is possible over the next 4 weeks as<br/>New Orleans faces: St. Louis, NY Jets, San Francisco and Indianapolis.  But<br/>for now, we're a little worried and Brooks needs to be downgraded with our<br/>fingers crossed to see him upgraded starting next week.<br/><br/>QB - Elvis Grbac - Two injuries in two weeks have Grbac downgraded once<br/>again this week.  Without a consistent running game, look for Grbac's<br/>struggles to continue.  For now, Grbac is expected to be listed as<br/>questionable for this week's game against Jacksonville.<br/><br/>QB - Charlie Batch - With 338 yards and 3 touchdowns, many would think that<br/>Batch deserves an upgrade.  Well, if the box scores were the only thing<br/>studied, this would be the case.  However, the season ending injury to<br/>Batch's #1 receiving option, Germane Crowell, gives Batch a downgrade in my<br/>book.  With both Crowell and Herman Moore out for the season, Batch must<br/>rely on Johnnie Morton and Larry Foster as his starting receivers...not a<br/>good sign.<br/><br/>QB - Vinny Testaverde - Testaverde was unable to get anything going against<br/>the Rams on Sunday.  With the Rams leading by a significant margin,<br/>Testaverde was benched in order to get Chad Pennington some playing time.<br/>All in all, not a good sign for Testaverde owners.  Testaverde's yardage<br/>numbers are poor this season.  However, he has thrown for multiple<br/>touchdowns in 3 of his 6 games this season.<br/><br/>RB - Warrick Dunn - Dunn suffered a hamstring strain on Sunday against the<br/>Steelers.  Look for Dunn to be listed as questionable on the injury report<br/>this week.  With the Vikings mediocre defense coming to town, Dunn's owners<br/>can't be very happy with this recent turn of events.  Joe's email updates<br/>will keep you posted on the latest Dunn news.<br/><br/>RB - Michael Bennett - Chapman was able to rush for 90 yards on 22 carries<br/>during Sunday's game versus Green Bay.  This is bad news for the<br/>unproductive, injured Bennett.  With Bennett failing to clear the 60-yard<br/>mark this season, his starting job is in jeopardy.  Keep an eye on this<br/>situation.<br/><br/>RB - James Stewart - Stewart suffered an ankle sprain in Sunday's loss to<br/>the Titans.  He was limited to 17 yards on 9 carries before leaving the<br/>game.  Expect him to be listed as questionable for this week's game.  As<br/>more of a straight ahead runner, Stewart may be able to play on the injury<br/>and be somewhat effective.  With this week's game on astroturf, the Lions<br/>may decide to rest Stewart and get him back to 100% health.  Regardless, any<br/>kind of injury to an often injured player deserves a downgrade.<br/><br/>RB - Tim Biakabatuka - Biakabatuka suffered a broken foot and is lost for<br/>the season.<br/><br/>RB - Terry Allen - Allen was limited to 12 yards on 3 carries after<br/>suffering an ankle injury on Sunday.  Backup Jason Brookins replaced Allen<br/>and looked decent.  If Allen misses any action, Brookins may replace him as<br/>the team's starter with one good performance.  The Ravens are exploring<br/>trade options for another running back prior to the trade deadline, so the<br/>Ravens RB situation is cloudy at the current time.<br/><br/>RB - James Allen - We've been hyping Anthony Thomas for weeks and it appears<br/>he will soon be named the official starting RB in Chicago.  Plain and<br/>simple, Allen has been horrible this season.  With Thomas gaining 188 yards<br/>on 22 carries, Allen will be relegated to spot duty.<br/><br/>RB - LaDainian Tomlinson - Tomlinson was limited to 58 yards on 25 carries<br/>and 0 touchdowns against a stingy Broncos defense.  It was bound to happen<br/>that a team would shut down Tomlinson.  Tomlinson owners should be happy<br/>that he received 25 carries despite being ineffective.  Just a slight<br/>downgrade to show he's human.  Keep him in your lineup.<br/><br/>WR - Marcus Robinson - Robinson suffered a torn ACL and MCL and is lost for<br/>the season.<br/><br/>WR - Germane Crowell - Crowell suffered a torn patella tendon and is lost<br/>for the season.<br/><br/>WR - Terry Glenn - Currently, Glenn is suffering from a hamstring strain<br/>that he suffered in last week's practice.  He missed Sunday's game and<br/>witnessed the \"David Patten Show\".  With Patten showcasing his playmaking<br/>skills, look for Glenn's touches to be reduced when he returns from injury.<br/>Previously, Glenn was considered the only playmaker on the Patriots offense.<br/>Glenn can post dazzling numbers, but his inconsistency has hurt fantasy<br/>owners in the past and this should once again be the case this season.<br/><br/>WR - Darney Scott - Scott's role in the Bengals' offense has seemingly been<br/>reduced in the last few weeks.  After suffering a rib injury that forced<br/>Scott out of Sunday's game, Kitna started finding Peter Warrick on a<br/>consistent basis.  With Kitna starting to build a rapport with the talented<br/>2nd year wideout from Florida St., Scott now appears to be the team's second<br/>option in the passing game.<br/><br/>WR - Marvin Minnis - Minnis has been non existent in the Chiefs offense<br/>since week 1.  With Sylvester Morris out for the season, Minnis looked ready<br/>to take over the role and produce quality numbers.  With Trent Green<br/>struggling at quarterback, Minnis' fantasy impact has been minimal at best.<br/>If Minnis is a starter on your roster, your receiving corps needs some<br/>serious help.<br/><br/><br/>/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/<br/><br/><br/>Waiver Wire<br/><br/><br/>QB - Tom Brady - 5 touchdown passes in the last 2 weeks deserves an upgrade<br/>in my book.  More importantly, Brady has yet to throw an interception this<br/>season.  When Bledsoe returns from injury, the Patriots' coaching staff will<br/>have a very difficult decision to make.  Right now, Brady deserves a pickup<br/>by any fantasy team needing a quarterback.<br/><br/>RB - Richard Huntley - Huntley has been named the team's starter after the<br/>season ending foot injury to Tim Biakabatuka.  It was only a matter of time<br/>before Biakabatuka would get injured or benched again.  With the Panthers<br/>facing the Jets pitiful run defense this week, Huntley should pay instant<br/>dividends.<br/><br/>RB - Doug Chapman - Chapman was able to rush for 90 yards on 22 carries in<br/>replacement of the injured Michael Bennett.  With the unproductive Bennett<br/>suffering from an ankle injury, Chapman will be given the chance to earn the<br/>team's starting running back job.  Grab him, if he is available.<br/><br/>RB - Jason Brookins - Terry Allen's ankle sprain may be all Brookins needs<br/>to become the team's starting running back.  He's looked good running behind<br/>a quality offensive line, but his carries have been limited due to Allen's<br/>presence.  Keep in mind, the Ravens are contacting other teams about trading<br/>for another back prior to the trade deadline.  Right now, Brookins is a<br/>solid waiver wire choice.<br/><br/>WR - David Patten - Anyone who rushes, passes and receives for a touchdown<br/>in the same game deserves an upgrade.  With Terry Glenn being bothered by a<br/>hamstring injury, Patten made the most of his opportunity.  He has looked<br/>good over the last few weeks and has shown the ability to make plays, which<br/>is needed in the Patriots offense.  Grab him, if you are in need of a<br/>receiver.<br/><br/>WR - David Terrell - Terrell had a breakout game on Sunday with 7 catches<br/>for 91 yards.  More importantly for his fantasy value, Marcus Robinson<br/>suffered a serious knee injury and is lost for the season.  The Robinson<br/>injury makes way for Terrell to enter the Bears' starting lineup.  If you're<br/>in need of a receiver, Terrell is the best option in the free agent market,<br/>if he is still available.<br/><br/>WR - Rod Gardner - While Michael Westbrook appears invisible, Gardner is<br/>impressing on the other side of the field.  208 yards and a touchdown (with<br/>another score called back), Gardner is starting to claim the title of \"best<br/>rookie receiver\".  Grab him, if he is available in your league.  Gardner is<br/>the lone bright spot in the Redskins passing game.<br/><br/>WR - Larry Foster - With Herman Moore and Germaine Crowell out for the<br/>season, the Lions will insert Larry Foster into the lineup.  Foster is a<br/>talented receiver out of LSU with playmaking skills.  If you are in a deep<br/>league and in need of receiver help, give Foster a shot on your team.<br/><br/><br/>/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/<br/><br/><br/>Bryant Analytics, Inc.

Scott, please drop by and brief me on these.  Cognizant Gov't? Never<br/>heard of  the term, and itis not one of the usual defined terms. Don't know<br/>how it's used here, suggest you decline andmake them clarify.<br/><br/>LOL ISSUES:<br/>1. I suppose that this is a NY law contract. I  do not think you can<br/>effectively limit your liability for gross negligence or wilful misconduct<br/>in NY. Regardless of choice of law, we generally cannot get this limited<br/>or excluded in contracts with owners, either.  I think you should not<br/>accept any GE attempt to limit this by means of the cap on liability or<br/>otherwise , and should avoid muddying the water on the point by taking any<br/>\"to the fullest extent permitted by law\" clause or other  such stuff as a<br/>compromise. It will be important every time we wrap the GE equipment.<br/><br/>2. Generally, I do not think they should be able to limit their indemnity<br/>for Haz Mat, patents, etc.<br/><br/>3. They have consistently refused to clarify that the indemnity  for all<br/>third party losses includes third party consequentials when Brian or<br/>whoever else over here has been the lead negotiator with GE in the past.

Agree.<br/>Seems that it would be a good idea to get a consensus on how to respond.<br/>Here are the issues I see:<br/><br/>Indemnity issues:<br/>They should indemnify us from claims by their employees/subcontractors.<br/>Kay - Is your comment in connection with GE's comment to Section 27.1(iii)<br/>(carve out of the 100% LOL for \"gross acts\" of its subcontractors, vendors,<br/>ect.)?  GE is in an aggressive outsource mode and needs to remain solely<br/>and totally responsible for the actions and liabilities for its<br/>subcontractors and vendors.  I think Section 20.2(a) as written covers<br/>simple negligence of GE's subcontractors and vendors and I would argue that<br/>we need to keep Section 27.1(iii) as written dealing with gross negligence<br/>of GE's subcontractors and vendors.<br/>Indemnity should be triggered by strict liability as well as negligence.<br/>Agree - Maybe we could agree to GE's strike out in 20.2(a) provided the<br/>phrase \"negligent or willfully wrongful\" is replaced with \"negligent, at<br/>fault or strictly liable without fault\" (or some variation thereof).<br/>What is a cognizant government?  Don't know!  This was not discussed with<br/>MIke so I am not sure what is the meaning of adding this term.  We need to<br/>also think in terms of how we could be harmed in a situation where GE fails<br/>to comply with law, and instead of Enron incurring a monetary penalty, is<br/>ordered to shut down the facility.<br/><br/>Limit of liability issues:<br/>They want to limit their indemnity obligations for complying with laws,<br/>patent infringement, liability for haz. waste and liens to 100% of purchase<br/>price.<br/>They want the limit of liability to apply to gross negligence, if possible.<br/>Agree - See 1st comment above re indemnity.<br/>They don't want to clarify that they have to indemnify us for another<br/>party's claim for consequentials (as in a personal injury claim).  Agree.<br/><br/>We've don't have anything concrete on assignment yet.  Agree.<br/><br/>Comments?  I suggest we get together before our next scheduled conf. call<br/>to discuss our game plan.<br/><br/>Sheila has asked that we change Wednesday's call to 1100 Central, or 100<br/>Central if 1100 doesn't work.

Having said that, however, I'd like to keep a \"last veto\" <br/><mark>right - just give me a call when you've got something.</mark><br/><br/>Good luck to you in the future, Jay.

Primarily <br/>for reasons of precedence, he was unwilling to pursue this option, which, <br/>while it is disappointing to me, I accept.<br/><br/>The purpose of this note is twofold.<br/><br/>First, I would like to thank you for making this company the great place it <br/>is today, and for giving me the opportunity to have a great career here.  I <br/>will forever look upon my nine plus years with Enron fondly.<br/><br/>Second, I would like to ask you as the administrator of the 1997 Long Term <br/>Incentive Plan to allow me to explore opportunities in the venture capital <br/>community without triggering non-compete provisions with regard to future <br/>payouts.  I very much enjoyed my brief role in venture capital, and have some <br/>very good contacts in that area here in New York.  Since NetWorks decided to <br/>cease operations in that business earlier in the year, I should not think <br/>that Enron would view anything I might do there as competitive, especially if <br/>I were not working directly in the energy space with an Enron competitor.<br/><br/>At present, I am planning to spend my time at least through the summer <br/>enjoying, and travelling with, my family.  I have nothing planned <br/>professionally as of yet, but wanted to take the opportunity to drop you this <br/>note while I might still be viewed positively (I hope that's not too <br/>presumptuous!).<br/><br/>Please let me know your thoughts on this non-compete provision as I would not <br/>wish for anything to be awkward for us going forward.<br/><br/>Again Jeff, thanks for many great memories, and as an Enron shareholder, keep <br/>up the great work!<br/><br/>Jay<br/><br/>\n",

Her current thinking <br/>is that it should be under one shop - not split responsibility.   Which shop <br/>is not clear to me - I presume this will be decided pretty soon.<br/><br/>The review will take place the week of Dec 4th.   She wants a straight <br/>forward  decription of what is left to be done and what the issues are.  I am <br/>thinking the presenters are Laine, Rick, Jose.  In attendance are Rob and <br/>John.     Can divide the presentation up into - <br/><br/>getting the construction finished/cost issues/EECC - subcontractor issues. - <br/>Laine <br/>Furnas/Electrobras issues - Rick <br/>YPF - gas supply - Mark to market position - opportunities - Rick<br/>MAE/ONS issues - current thinking.  - Jose<br/>Current economics. - Rick<br/><br/>Everyone should have a page prepared ahead of time with the discussion topics <br/>on it - she doesn't want a detailed presentation - just the facts.   Can we <br/>send the page per topic around by this friday.  <br/><br/>I will ask Rebecca for two hours the week of the 4th and let you know.<br/><br/>Joe - we should talk about where the project should best end up - I think <br/>Rebecca is flexible -   don't really know what Dave is thinking.<br/><br/>Pete<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n",

      "Robert Briden<br/>30 Pleasant St.<br/>Lincoln, RI 02865<br/>rbriden@ballou.com<br/><br/>To Mr. Ken Lay,<br/><br/>I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.<br/><br/>Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.<br/><br/>The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  <mark>Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.</mark><br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Robert Briden\n",

As you know, we <br/>have been going through the data-room process and we will be calling for <br/>final bids on April 9th.  Dominic is finalizing the draft PSA and associated <br/>bidding documents at this time.  We plan to distribute a copy of such to all <br/>potential bidders by the end of the week.<br/><br/>At this time we have 15 companies that have signed the CA and are at various <br/>stages in the evaluation process.  We believe we have 7-8 serious bidders and <br/>we hope to get at least 3-4 bids submitted on the 9th.  To complicate the <br/>process a little, we have 3 majors seriously evaluating both the E&P <br/>properties and the old EI China pipeline project.  We are coordinating with <br/>Chris Hunt, Bill Krenz and Keith Stepp on the integrated sale of both assets <br/>with this select group of companies.  In addition to the  current drafting <br/>work, we will have a few additional data-room visitors prior to the 9th, due <br/>diligence requests and, of course, definitive agreement negotiations to <br/>conclude before the process is complete.<br/><br/>The reason I outlined the above is to give all concerned parties a feel for <br/>the process we need Dominic to participate in (to varying degrees) until it <br/>is concluded.  There will be times where this project will require 100% of <br/>his time for several days and then other times where there will be a few days <br/>with no pressing issues.  However, to avoid any confusion over the next <br/>couple of months I thought it would be a good idea to lay out a few ground <br/>rules for Dominic's time.<br/><br/>1) EGEP supports Dominic re-deploying to the LNG group and will strive to get <br/>him 100% transferred as soon as practical.<br/>2) During the next couple of months Dominic will have some \"dead time\" in the <br/>China disposition and during this time we are supportive of Dominic spending <br/>time with the LNG group, getting up to speed with the activities in the group <br/>and taking on low-priority assignments that could be delayed if his time was <br/>needed in the sale process.<br/>3) The only assignment Dominic has to complete with EGEP is the sale of the <br/>China assets.  There will be no future assignments.<br/>4) Until EGEP senior management releases Dominic to the LNG group, his <br/>primary responsibility will be the China sale and this activity will take <br/>precedence over any other assignments.<br/>5) Until EGEP senior management releases Dominic to the LNG group, his <br/>primary office will remain in 3 Allen Center with EGEP.  He is expected to <br/>report to 3 Allen Center and the daily 8:30 am disposition meeting to <br/>ascertain any sale related needs for his time.  This meeting usually lasts <br/>for 30-45 minutes and if there are no issues he can report to the LNG group.<br/><br/>In some ways I know this appears to be a little silly.  However, I also know <br/>that if we don't set out a few rules we will encounter a problem and it is <br/>not fair to Dominic or in Enron's best interest to let Dominic take on two <br/>\"A-priority\" projects at this time.  We need his services to successfully <br/>sell this project. Unfortunately, we can not schedule when certain activities <br/>will be needed, but we will be reasonable whenever possible to allow for a <br/>smooth effort in both groups.  During the next couple of months I'm sure <br/>Dominic will be a very positive addition to your staff in spite of the time <br/>allocated to the China sale effort.  He has been a very productive and <br/>valuable employee for our group and I am very glad Enron found a way to <br/>retain his services.<br/><br/>If you have any questions please give me a call.  Thanks for your support <br/>during this short-term need in our group.  We will try to make this <br/>inconvenience as small as possible.<br/><br/>jeff <br/><br/>\n",

      "Nancy Langhart<br/>309 Nutgrove Ln<br/>Albany, NY 12202<br/>langharn@maail.strose.edu<br/><br/>To Mr. Ken Lay,<br/><br/>I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.<br/><br/>Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.<br/><br/>The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  <mark>Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.</mark><br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Nancy Langhart\n",

I can<br/>pull those together if you believe that they would be helpful.<br/><br/>My plan is to be at the meeting in Chicago next monday and I can answer<br/>questions (off line so that I don't take committee time) about these<br/>documents if that would be useful for individuals.<br/><br/>BEST<br/><br/>Richard D.

The exact wording for the pressure requirement is:<br/><br/>SECTION 5. PRESSURE. <br/><br/>Seller shall tender gas to Buyer, at the delivery point on the California/Arizona border near Needles, California, at a pressure of not less than 750 PSIG, and not more than 1000 psiq, with an anticipated nominal operating pressure of approximately 800 psig, unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. For purposes of this Service Agreement, pressure at the delivery point shall be calculated from actual readings at Seller's Needles measurement facility utilising generally accepted engineering formulas designed to calculate a pressure drop over a given distance of pipeline, gravity, temperature, and flow rate and other variables as may be reasonably necessary to make such computation, and may be confirmed by calculations at Buyer's North Needles Compressor station. <br/><br/>It is my interpretation that our pressure requirement occurs exactly at the California/Arizona state line and we can use modeling methods to determine the required outlet pressure at the Needles station required to achieve 800 psig at the state line.<br/><br/>\n",

That works out to about 429 day.  <br/><br/>I just spoke to Samson and he agrees the volume for July should only be 4,000 <br/>for the month.  <br/><br/>AND Angie (my super fantastic, can't say enough good things about her, will <br/>probably be my boss someday and sometimes acts like it,  CNG scheduler) has <br/>agreed to help out any way she can.  She knows escript pretty well.  Chat <br/>with Doug, if you guys agree, Angie can use your ID and password and figure <br/>out how to run all the reports we need back to January.  Also, we will not <br/>know the actuals for July production until September sometime.<br/><br/>Effective August 1st, the Phillip's wells should be transferred to Clinton's <br/>brand new pool and Clinton will also nominate the Power Gas pool gas. <br/><br/>Doug, John Singer said he does not have any production reports from Heidi.  <br/>With Angie's help, we could probably clear up the CNG LDC activity fairly <br/>easy.<br/><br/>Let me know what you guys think.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>kdestep@columbiaenergygroup.com on 07/18/2000 02:02:39 PM<br/>To: \" - *Chris_Germany@enron.com\" <Chris_Germany@enron.com>, \" - <br/>*pleanza@enron.com\" <pleanza@enron.com><br/>cc: \" - *Kinney, Doug\" <dkinney@columbiaenergygroup.com> <br/>Subject: PNG Local Production July 00<br/><br/><br/>Hi Paul and Chris,<br/> Our friend Sampson at Power Gas still maintains that their local<br/>production behind PNG has not been nominated for July yet, which was 7500<br/>dth/month.  Did you guys do a deal for this gas too?  He usually nominates it<br/>all on one day, so Clinton/CES needs to coordinate with him what day to do it<br/>on (right now the gas is out there on his side on the 17th).  I know Heidi<br/>nominated the Phillips gas baseloaded thru the month at 443/day, but I was not<br/>sure about the Power, until I checked and sure enough the nom isn't out there<br/>yet.<br/> I can get help nominating it from PNG to get it through CES' pool but I<br/>want to make sure that's what we need to do.  Just give me the word and I will<br/>call Sampson to get it done, but I will make it clear to him that this is the<br/>last month he'll need to talk to me about it.  Thank you very much for the<br/>clarifications!<br/><br/>Kara D. aka the lone ranger at CES<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n",

      "Andy:<br/>The problem if we limit the size on options to being what size is offered on <br/>the swap hedge, we will not be able to offer adequate size on the options.  <br/>Optimally, I think we want to offer a minimum size of 100 across all <br/>strikes.  If the swap is 4/4.5, one a day up, and someone buys half a day, <br/>making the market, 4/4.5 one a day by half a day, the size offered on a 10 <br/>cent out of the money call might be as low as 30 contracts, a much smaller <br/>size than most people want to trade.  If we restrict to strikes with a lower <br/>delta, we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a <br/>market in options that have open EOL interest that have moved closer to the <br/>money.  <br/>Maybe the answer is to assume the swap hedge to be a penny wide two way <br/>wrapped around the EOL swap mid market.  Thus if the front swap on EOL is <br/>4/4.5 one a day by half a day,  the input into the option calculator is <br/>3.75/4.75, 100 up.  In this case I think 100 is necessary because once a <br/>strike has open interest, we must continue to support it.  Thus I anticipate <br/>having to make markets in deep itm options as the market moves.<br/><br/>In terms of straddle strikes, I think the edge received from buying straddles <br/>struck on the EOL offer and vice-versa is not big enough to compensate for <br/>what I think the industry will view as a scam and another way Enron is trying <br/>to rip people off.  Although striking on the mid-market is probably easier <br/>for the trader, I actually think striking in five cent increments makes more <br/>sense.  It allows people to trade out of the position on EOL.  Whereas if <br/>someone buys the 3085 straddle and the market moves to 3200, they have to <br/>call ENE to close the trade.  If the trade is struck at 3100, we will have a <br/><mark>market on both the 3100 call and put at all times.</mark>  Secondly, I would <br/>anticipate non-volatility driven option traders may elect to sell either just <br/>the put or call in this scenario depending on their view of market direction.\n",

Edison \"arranged\" for the Brattle Group to be the star <br/>witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.  Their job was to set up El Paso and <br/>Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.  Their <br/>message was simple (and simplistic):<br/><br/>El Paso and Dynegy have market power.<br/>They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas <br/>at the border (to \"obscene\" levels).<br/>That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.<br/><br/>Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide <br/>the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets <br/>any questions on the topic.  It's attached.  Apologies, it's quick and dirty, <br/>but it provides the basics.<br/><br/>Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to <br/>offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California <br/>Legislature is peddling.<br/><br/>Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the <br/>California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis <br/>when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity), but the overriding goal of <br/>the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.<br/><br/>Best,<br/>Jeff<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n",

Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.<br/><br/>Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.<br/><br/>The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  <mark>Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.</mark><br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Lori Josephson\n",

I have a couple of issues <br/>I want ot clear up for this year's contract.<br/><br/>The question is how valero wants to treat the three meter locations where you <br/>are currently pulling gas.  Our new contract that was just sent to you has a <br/>minimum take of 60,000 mmbtu (estimated 35,000 @ 8018 Celanese, 15,000 @ 1233 <br/>Texas City, and 10,000 @ 1394 Dodge Street).  If you undertake at any meter <br/>excess volumes from another meter would be used to fulfill the entire 60,000 <br/>mmbtu.  My accountant has told me that this is causing difficulties with the <br/>two plants and how they want to see gas purchases broken out.

      "Hilary Manners<br/>New York, NY 10009<br/>hmlight@aol.com<br/><br/>To Mr. Ken Lay,<br/><br/>I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.<br/><br/>Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.<br/><br/>The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  <mark>Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.</mark><br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Hilary Manners\n",

Perhaps you've created an expense report<br/>template in Excel that has the fields your accounting department is<br/>interested in.<br/><br/>But if you want to really impress the users, how about templates which<br/>automatically populate themselves with user data (names, departments,<br/>etc.)? If you've got NetWare 4.x or 5.x and use Microsoft Office, you<br/>can do that - quickly, easily and (best of all) for free.<br/><br/>Novell Directory Services-Enabled Office is a tool for automating the<br/>task of filling in standard forms with user and departmental data from<br/>your NDS directory. It=01,s based on ActiveX controls and uses Visual<br/>Basic scripts to feed that data into your forms.<br/><br/>To use NDS-Enabled Office, you must create Microsoft Word or Excel<br/>templates that contain Visual Basic script macros that call users=01, NDS<br/>data, such as their names or departments. You can then send your<br/>templates to any employee in the company, and when the employee opens<br/>the template, the document will be filled in automatically with that<br/>employee's NDS information.<br/><br/>The NDS-Enabled Office installation includes sample templates. One is a<br/>Word fax template, and the other is an Excel expense report template.<br/><br/>It saves paper, saves employees' time and it=01,s free.

      "Roger, if EPA has approved other alternate methods for determining sulfur in <br/><mark>fuel gas, can you approve of these for our sulfur methods?</mark>   The reason I ask <br/>is that we are not set up to do any of the applications mentioned in Appendix <br/>D.  We  have approved custom fuel monitoring schedules in place at 5 other <br/>compressor station locations and have been approved to use \"stain tubes\" or <br/>total sulfur analyzers.  These were issued by Region IX and Region VI.  I can <br/>send you copies of the approvals from the other Regions if that will help.  <br/>If not, I would recommend that you write the permit with all the below <br/>referenced test methods and we will work out the details.  WIll it be <br/>possible to make a change to the permit after things quiet down a bit and we <br/>have more time to taylor the permit  for you and us?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Kohn.Roger@epamail.epa.gov on 10/18/2001 05:54:40 PM<br/>To: Larry.Campbell@enron.com<br/>cc:  <br/><br/>Subject: Sulfur Content Test Method<br/><br/><br/><br/>Larry,<br/><br/>I am going on vacation for two weeks - my last day will be Oct. 31,<br/>which is a little before the end of the comment period.  I am doing<br/>everything I can to make sure the permits are ready to issue when the<br/>comment period ends.  You have asked about using a sulfur analyzer.<br/>Since that is not typical practice for facilities subject to NSPS GG, I<br/>would have to research that.  Frankly, if you want your permits ASAP,<br/>there really isn't time for that.  Does one of the test methods in<br/>Appendix D of Part 75, which I've pasted below, work for you?  (I know<br/>some don't.)  Please advise so we can keep the process moving.  Thanks.<br/><br/>2.3.3.1.2      Use one of the following methods when using manual<br/>sampling (as applicable to the type of gas combusted) to determine the<br/>sulfur<br/>content of the fuel: ASTM D1072-90, \"Standard Test Method for Total<br/>Sulfur in Fuel Gases\", ASTM D4468-85 (Reapproved 1989) \"Standard<br/>Test Method for Total Sulfur in Gaseous Fuels by Hydrogenolysis and<br/>Radiometric Colorimetry,\" ASTM D5504-94 \"Standard Test Method for<br/>Determination of Sulfur Compounds in Natural Gas and Gaseous Fuels by<br/>Gas Chromatography and Chemiluminescence,\" or ASTM D3246-81<br/>(Reapproved 1987) \"Standard Test Method for Sulfur in Petroleum Gas By<br/>Oxidative Microcoulometry\" (incorporated by reference under<br/>o  75.6).<br/><br/>Roger Kohn<br/>U.S. EPA Region 9<br/>75 Hawthorne St., Mail Code AIR-3<br/>San Francisco, CA  94105<br/>phone: (415) 744-1238<br/>fax:   (415) 744-1076<br/><br/><br/>\n",

      " <<MF September 4th 2001.pdf>><br/><br/>   Good Tuesday Morning - Comments From The Local Guys!<br/><br/>Last week, the markets got so oversold, that the ARMS Index (a technical<br/>market measure that, broadly speaking, indicates how oversold the market<br/>is),<br/>closed above 2.00 on two consecutive days for the first time since Oct. 16<br/>and 19, 1987!! It is, apparently, one of the rarest occurrences in the world<br/>of technical analysis. As we said, it has been 14 years since the the<br/>markets generated such a reading. The NYSE is currently rallying however,<br/>tech is still struggling.<br/>Lets hope today's strength translates broadly across all sectors.<br/><br/>The 30 -year bond yield is 5.49%.<br/>The 10-year is trading at 4.98%.<br/>The 5-year is trading at 4.55%.<br/>Spot crude oil is trading at $26.94 p/b.<br/>Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $2.37 p/mcf.<br/><br/>   AD Time:<br/><br/>New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) has been adopted by the SEC<br/>under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule greatly enhances an<br/>insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during<br/>blackout periods.<br/>Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and<br/>insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.<br/>Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and<br/>sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan<br/>was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession<br/>of material, non-public information.<br/>The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.<br/>Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the<br/>regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.    <mark>Please email us or</mark><br/>call us for more information.<br/><br/>   Lehman's Research<br/><br/><br/><br/>IMPACT CALLS<br/><br/>Wireline Services B. Bath, .202.452.4732<br/>Cutting '02 RBOC Ests; Commercial Mkt Slowdown Persists<br/>*Lowering '02 revenue, cashflow, EPS and capex forecasts for RBOCs as \"Data<br/>Economy\" remains weak. Commercial data markets<br/>remain particularly slow and we believe some sectors of this market, namely<br/>emerging carrier wholesale and IRUs, are likely to<br/>experience yoy declines in '02, reversing a key growth driver over the last<br/>few years. Business voice revenues, commercial<br/>advertising and international markets are also impacted by similar volume<br/>declines.<br/>*However, we believe the RBOCs are most able to weather the slowdown and<br/>will be the best positioned post the industry shakedown<br/>due to cost/capex cutting capability, strong balance sheets, managements'<br/>focus on core activities and improving '02 returns on capital<br/>despite a revenue growth slowdown.<br/><br/>Wireline Services B. Bath, .202.452.4732<br/>Industry Capex Cuts, Better Focus Yield Better Returns<br/>*We are reducing our capex expectations for the Telecom carriers given<br/>continued weakness in commercial Data demand and more<br/>focused industry spending. We are reducing our total industry capital<br/>spending forecast in '01 and '02 by $1.2B and $9.2B,<br/>respectively, partly in anticipation of another wave of capex cuts at the<br/>megacaps in the near-term. Despite the changes to our<br/>revenue and EPS forecasts outlined in our companion note (\"Cutting '02 RBOC<br/>Ests; Commercial Market Slowdown Persists\"), we<br/>reiterate our view that 2001 is a year of inflection in ROE, as key<br/>return-on-capital metrics (rev/capex, EBITDA/capex, and FCF) are<br/>improving at a FASTER-THAN-EXPECTED rate.<br/><br/>CLECs  D. Zito, .202.452.4748<br/>Data Revisited<br/>*A sluggish economy and slowing IT spending continue to dampen data revenue<br/>growth projections in the sector, as we've noted in the<br/>past.<br/>*We currently project a modest recovery in data revenue growth in late 2002.<br/>A further prolonged macroeconomic slump could cause<br/>us to revisit these estimates, however.<br/>*We project data growth to accelerate 350 bps from 17.5% in 1H02 to 21.0% in<br/>2H02, with the second half of the year accounting for<br/>60% of the absolute data growth forecasted for 2002.<br/><br/>Time Warner Telecom(TWTC) 1 - Strong Buy D.

Levy, .212.526.2499<br/>Still Searching for the Bottom<br/>*Coincident with Lehman Brothers' telecom services analysts trimming their<br/>2002 N. American carrier spending est, we are taking a<br/>slightly more conservative view of our carrier spending outlook as well, and<br/>our revenue est for Lucent and Tellabs. Most of our<br/>telecom services analysts' capex cutbacks are based on the increasing<br/>concern that N. American incumbent carriers are likely to<br/>accelerate their spending contraction in 2002 and we are focusing on Lucent<br/>and Tellabs due to their heavy concentration of sales to<br/>incumbent N. American service providers.<br/>*While our revenue and EPS forecasts are being modestly reduced for both<br/>Lucent and Tellabs we are maintaining our 1-Strong Buy<br/>ratings on those two stocks as we believe they still represent attractive<br/>longer-term investment opportunities.<br/><br/>Broadband Access Technologies A. Green, .212.526.3860<br/>Implications of Further Cap Ex Reductions<br/>*Lehman Brother's service provider analysts are reducing their expectations<br/>today for capital spending by North American service<br/>providers in '01 and '02. Compared to prior expectations of capital spending<br/>contraction of 3% in 2001 and a further 11% in 2002,<br/>the Lehman team now looks for spending to fall 5% in 2001 and 19% in 2002.<br/>*This is further evidence that the challenging times continue for the<br/>providers of data communications technology, including those<br/>companies focused on the access portion of the network.<br/>*Below we discuss the implications of these new cap ex assumptions on the<br/>companies in our Broadband Access Technologies<br/>Universe with exposure to the telecom service providers - ADCT, AFCI, ORCT,<br/>NXTV, TUTS, TSTN, and VINA.<br/><br/>Semiconductors & Communications A. Chanda, .415.274.5370<br/>Telecom Far from Bottom<br/>*We believe that the telecom components companies such as AMCC, Agere, JDS<br/>Uniphase, PMC-Sierra and Vitesse will continue to<br/>underperform the market as valuations remain high and business conditions<br/>continue to weaken.<br/>*We believe that the first two months of Q3 were weak for the telecom<br/>components sector. In particular, we believe that although we<br/>are through the first stage of cancellations having ended, backlog continues<br/>to weaken.<br/>*In addition, we do not believe that the market has reflected the<br/>fundamentals adequately in the valuations of the component vendors.<br/>Current valuations of the IC vendors of 10x-plus revenue multiples in C01<br/>and C02 are unrealistic in the face of revenue growth<br/>declining for two years for their customers and by implication, the<br/>component vendors themselves.<br/><br/>Nike Inc(NKE) 1 - Strong Buy R.

Our new<br/>estimate represents 13.6% growth. We reiterate our 1<br/>Strong Buy rating and $100 price target for FNM.<br/>*The Refi Index recently surpassed the 2,000 mark and the yield curve<br/>remains steep. In this market environment, we believe FNM<br/>will likely continue to report strong mortgage purchase volume.<br/>*We originally projected that FNM's retained portfolio growth in 2001 would<br/>be front-end loaded. However, the recent refinance<br/>trend and the fixed income market conditions make us believe that its<br/>retained portfolio growth should continue to be strong in the<br/>second half of the year.<br/>*The law of average balance means that if the ending balance of the year is<br/>X% higher than the average balance for the year, net<br/>interest income in the following year will be higher at least by X%<br/>(assuming a stable margin). Thus, stronger portfolio growth in the<br/>second half of 2001 translates into higher earnings growth in 2002.<br/><br/>Freddie Mac(FRE) 1 - Strong Buy B.

Thus, we are raising our '01 EPS estimate<br/>by $0.03 to $4.18 and our '02 EPS estimate by $0.05 to $4.75. We reiterate<br/>our 1 Strong Buy rating for FRE.<br/>*So far this year, FRE raised its guidance for its net retained portfolio<br/>growth 3 times. Its most recent guidance was $80-$90 bil.<br/>However, since FRE gave its current guidance, refi activities have picked<br/>up. Further, July was another strong month for FRE with<br/>$11 bil. of net portfolio growth.<br/>*Although the company still maintains its official guidance at $80-$90 bil.,<br/>we believe that FRE's net retained portfolio growth should<br/>surpass $100 bil.<br/>*Thus, we are raising our EPS estimates for this year and the next year.<br/>FRE's strong retained portfolio growth in the second half of<br/>the year should benefit FRE well into 2002.<br/><br/>SBC Communications(SBC) 1 - Strong Buy B.

      "Vince:<br/><br/>Thanks for breakfast last Friday.  I have been reflecting on a couple of<br/>your thoughts and very much want to take the steps forward you suggested.<br/>Let me take a shot at articulating what we said to make sure I have it<br/><mark>right, and let me take a shot at making comments and suggestions.</mark><br/><br/>Firstly, thanks for agreeing to bring MarketPoint to the attention of your<br/>outside equity people once again.  I understand that you are a go between,<br/>and I recognize and appreciate whatever efforts you are able to make.  I<br/>also recognize as you admonished that there are no guarantees here and that<br/>you can only do your best.  Thank you for that no matter what the outcome.<br/><br/>Secondly, your suggestion that our short term gas and electric models shoul=<br/>d<br/>be =01&click throughs=018 (my words intended to reflect the sentiment you<br/>expressed) on the enrononline.com website are absolutely consistent with th=<br/>e<br/>MarketPoint business concept and right up our alley.  I unequivocally want<br/>to move forward with that.  All that remains for MarketPoint to do so is to<br/>secure the venture capitalization to create the website delivery system to<br/>accommodate such click through and browser access.  We have the hard part<br/>done (the enabling technology) and we only lack the internet delivery<br/>system.  That should take a few months time after we secure the<br/>capitalization we need.  However, in the meantime, we would be prepared to<br/>put Excel spreadsheets with our scenarios in a web location where they can<br/>be clicked through from enrononline.com, and that could be done a bit soone=<br/>r<br/>if you and your enrononline.com people might be interested in providing the<br/>capitalization.  We already offer our North American electric plant data<br/>base on a click though basis through e-acumen.com, so that part of our<br/>infrastructure is already available (or imminent).  I believe they are goin=<br/>g<br/>commercial with our data product any time now.  Please let me know how we<br/>can consummate an agreement here.<br/><br/>Thirdly, I am surmising there might be a lot of value to Enron from applyin=<br/>g<br/>and demonstrating MarketPoint in the more nascent areas of your business<br/>where there are clearly few or no credible, comprehensive, pre-existing,<br/>proprietary fundamental modeling tools (e.g., metals, telecommunications,<br/>MIPS, agricultural commodities, water).  I would jump at the chance to work<br/>under your sponsorship to build an inherently new, previously nonexistent<br/>forward market model of a commodity such as copper, silver, gold, phosphate=<br/>,<br/>aluminum, potash, grain, or some other commodity you want to attack.  That<br/>would give you an objective =01&kick at the can=018 unfettered by the fact =<br/>that<br/>there are previously existing models you might want to compare against each<br/>other or against your own or that you have ongoing internal capabilities in<br/>those areas.  You have the prospect to get immediate value from such a mode=<br/>l<br/>in your embryonic metal or other trading business and to evaluate<br/>MarketPoint people and MarketPoint technology in a real life setting.  I<br/>should mention that I have a relationship with what I consider to be the<br/>premier mining/mineral processing group in the world (Michigan Technologica=<br/>l<br/>University).  Working with their metals/mineral processing professors, we<br/>could build a world scope forward copper, gold, silver, aluminum, or simila=<br/>r<br/>model in several weeks time that considers every facility in every supply<br/>chain in the world.  (Most metals have no more than several tens or a few<br/>hundreds of facilities in the world total, and those facilities are well<br/>known and accessible over the Internet or from trade associations or the<br/>government.  Our United States Geological Survey contacts should be very<br/>useful here.)  I really respect the Michigan Tech people I know.  They know<br/>the metal supply chains all the way from the geology and resource<br/>considerations at the extreme upstream end, the existing and prospective<br/>ways to mine and process that resource into such intermediate goods as<br/>pregnant leach solution, copper sulfide concentrate, gold cyanate, blister<br/>copper, solvent extraction/electrowinning intermediate product, and<br/>ultimately into final goods such as tubing, sheeting, wires, and other fina=<br/>l<br/>forms.  I would be prepared to send you a brief proposal and consulting<br/>contract to undertake such an effort, and I am confident I can get Michigan<br/>Tech to subcontract the data and domain expertise at modest cost.  They hav=<br/>e<br/>strong incentives to do something like this, for it connects them even more<br/>closely to the industry they covet.  If you access the Michigan Tech<br/>website, you will see a Dr. Carl Nesbitt (my brother) there as a mining and<br/>minerals processor person.  He has recognized world class skills in that<br/>field and is an Altos associate as well as a tenured Michigan Tech<br/>professor.<br/><br/>Fourthly, I agree with your sentiment that =01&Enron has been quite success=<br/>ful<br/>with what we have been doing=018 and that =01&We lean toward our own techno=<br/>logy.=018<br/>I have the utmost respect and admiration for Enron and the technology and<br/>thinking you have operationalized in the past.  Notwithstanding that<br/>comment, I am sure Enron would not consider writing your own spreadsheet<br/>code to replace Excel or writing your own C++ compiler to replace Microsoft=<br/>=01,<br/>s or writing your own LP code to avoid purchasing one commercially.  There<br/>is simply no economic impetus to redo what comes from the commercial market<br/>better and cheaper--Enron buys rather than builds technology that augments<br/>your productivity, as you should, as long as it does not compromise<br/>confidentiality or competitive advantage.  Vince, MarketPoint is technology<br/>that augments Enron=01,s productivity and allows you to do what you want to=<br/> do<br/>in the fundamental modeling area rapidly and accurately.  MarketPoint does<br/>not substitute for or devalue your internally developed technology; it<br/>augments and extends your people, data, and fundamental market insight.<br/>MarketPoint already has over 200 man years of cumulative development effort<br/>embedded within it, and it is just now becoming a custom =01&tinkertoy set=<br/>=018<br/>approach that Enron can use to enhance your productivity and accelerate wha=<br/>t<br/>you want to do in the fundamental modeling arena.  Like Excel, it has passe=<br/>d<br/>the market test for almost twenty years across the entire industry<br/>(including Enron itself).  There are people in Enron today who I believe<br/>hold MarketPoint/NARG in high esteem in part because they are aware of its<br/>formidable and notable success over the past many years.  I hope you and<br/>your people can come to view MarketPoint in that way=01*-an automated<br/>productivity tool that can help Enron build and monitize proprietary conten=<br/>t<br/>faster, cheaper, and more accurately than you otherwise might and than your<br/>competitors can.  MarketPoint might save you a lot of time and money, and i=<br/>t<br/>might allow you to redirect your resources toward even more productivity an=<br/>d<br/>profitability, just as Excel and Microsoft C++ have done.  With the advent<br/>of e-commerce, your business is ultimately more =01&up for grabs=018 than i=<br/>t once<br/>was.  I must say I admire your early success and your early strong lead.<br/>However, barriers to e-commerce entry are smaller than barriers to<br/>traditional business entry, and \"branding\" is harder to hold.  You need to<br/>continue and in fact accelerate the first mover advantage and \"branding\" yo=<br/>u<br/>have so successfully built in the past decade and a half, and I believe tha=<br/>t<br/>top quality, high barrier-to-entry, rapid deployment technologies such as<br/>MarketPoint might help you do so.  I would even go one step further.  In th=<br/>e<br/>coming e-commerce era, technology such as MarketPoint will play even more o=<br/>f<br/>a role, and labor centric activities will be risky and (statistically) less<br/>successful.  We are pleased MarketPoint is emerging at the start of today's<br/>\"inter-vertical competition\" era because we believe all the winners such as<br/>Enron will ultimately need to use it if they are to be successful.<br/>Increasingly, the \"not invented here\" approach is likely to be supplanted<br/>with the \"cobble together elements of technology to make meta-technology\"<br/>because first mover advantage and branding will accelerate in value.<br/>MarketPoint enabling technology is perfect for that.<br/><br/>Fifthly, I should mention that if any people in your traditional gas and<br/>electric and other businesses want to use MarketPoint or Altos, please feel<br/>free to contact me with the opportunity.  We are eager to serve their or<br/>your immediate business needs as they encounter them in our traditional<br/>consulting mode.  That was the point of the earlier meeting Kim Watson<br/>organized, and that objective hopefully has not fallen by the wayside durin=<br/>g<br/>our private discussions.<br/><br/>After you have had a couple of days to think about the foregoing five<br/>points, let=01,s talk.  I think if you get the chance to work with me and<br/>MarketPoint, you will see that we are what we aspire to be--the \"Enron of<br/>the fundamental forward pricing world\"-=01*the best in class.  A partnershi=<br/>p<br/>between two bests in class certainly makes sense.  I know you have no basis<br/>to believe that MarketPoint is best in class--it is new, and you and I have<br/>not worked together in close proximity.  I am eager to provide you a low<br/>cost, high value opportunity to determine whether that might be true.  Let'=<br/>s<br/>communicate by email or by phone in a week or ten days and see if we might<br/>get something going.<br/><br/>Dale Nesbitt<br/>650.218.3069\n",

In my discussions with Audrey, she expressed a hope that Enron would be able to support the filing and that she'd like to open a dialogue on how to get our support.  I indicated that there were at least 2 issues that would be of concern for us---support for one RTO and support for one tariff within that RTO.  Although she was open and probably even supportive of one RTO in the midwest, there is a separate tariff for any delivery within the Translink system within her proposal.  SHe described that tariff as being different than the Detroit Edison case that you guys filed against.  I confirmed that the publics who are in the transco (NPPD, OPPD, Cornbelt) would not agree to be in the transco without the separate tariff.<br/><br/>I have sent via overnight a copy of materials on the transco to both of you.  I told her that Donna was that lead on the Midwest team, and that you'd be willing to talk/meet with her.  If practical, it would be good if you could call her in the next few days for a number of reasons---1.) I am sure that Xcel is planning a similiar transco for the west and if you can get a better sense of whether we are on any of the same pages, it would be good to have that input for our western discussion on Wednesday in Houston  2.) she is one of the panelists for RTO week, so you might be able to set up a time in D.C. that you could meet in person  3.) you might be able to get a sense of what she will be talking about at RTO week on her panel.<br/><br/>Here is her info:    Audrey Zibelman<br/>    VIce President<br/>    Xcel Energy<br/>    Independent Transmission COmpany<br/>    414 Nicollet Mall  6th FLoor<br/>    Minneapolis, MN  55401<br/><br/>    audrey.a.zibelman@xcelenergy.com<br/><br/>    #612-330-7713\n",

I do not know your actual budget for 2000.  I used <br/>the information for the last 5 months of 2000 budget to estimate for the year <br/>(see 2000 Budget tab in the attached file).  The attached file contains the <br/>following tabs:<br/><br/> Budget vs Budget Comparison of 2000 vs 2001<br/> <mark>Allocation  Allocation - please allocate the rest of the 21.7% to ENA</mark><br/> 2000 Budget  Estimated 2000 budget based on the last 5 months information<br/> Research  2001 budget<br/><br/>The calculation for taxes and benefits does not equal to the calculation in <br/>your template (Corp).  Plus, I have to add A&A overhead cost that Corp will <br/>bill us for A&A program (line 78).  Can we meet to discuss the allocation to <br/>ENA and the increase in plan?

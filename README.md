# ExtrAction - MIDS Capstone Project

ExtrAction is a Google Chrome extension that reads your emails and extracts action items onto a todo list to make your life simpler!

### My work

I worked primarily in UI. Code written by me can be found in "chrome-extension/extension-bundle". The bulk of it was written in popup.js, index.html, and styles.css.
